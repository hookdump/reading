INTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\nSOME DETAILS OF THE BIOGRAPHY OF THAT HIGHLY RESPECTED GENTLEMAN STEPAN\r\nTROFIMOVITCH VERHOVENSKY.","I\r\n\r\nIN UNDERTAKING to describe the recent and strange incidents in our town,\r\ntill lately wrapped in uneventful obscurity, I find myself forced in\r\nabsence of literary skill to begin my story rather far back, that is\r\nto say, with certain biographical details concerning that talented and\r\nhighly-esteemed gentleman, Stepan Trofimovitch Verhovensky. I trust that\r\nthese details may at least serve as an introduction, while my projected\r\nstory itself will come later.","I will say at once that Stepan Trofimovitch had always filled a\r\nparticular r√¥le among us, that of the progressive patriot, so to say,\r\nand he was passionately fond of playing the part--so much so that I\r\nreally believe he could not have existed without it. Not that I would\r\nput him on a level with an actor at a theatre, God forbid, for I really\r\nhave a respect for him. This may all have been the effect of habit, or\r\nrather, more exactly of a generous propensity he had from his earliest\r\nyears for indulging in an agreeable day-dream in which he figured as\r\na picturesque public character.","He fondly loved, for instance, his\r\nposition as a \"persecuted\" man and, so to speak, an \"exile.\" There is a\r\nsort of traditional glamour about those two little words that fascinated\r\nhim once for all and, exalting him gradually in his own opinion, raised\r\nhim in the course of years to a lofty pedestal very gratifying to\r\nvanity. In an English satire of the last century, Gulliver, returning\r\nfrom the land of the Lilliputians where the people were only three or\r\nfour inches high, had grown so accustomed to consider himself a giant\r\namong them, that as he walked along the streets of London he could not\r\nhelp crying out to carriages and passers-by to be careful and get out of\r\nhis way for fear he should crush them, imagining that they were little\r\nand he was still a giant.","He was laughed at and abused for it, and rough\r\ncoachmen even lashed at the giant with their whips. But was that just?\r\nWhat may not be done by habit? Habit had brought Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nalmost to the same position, but in a more innocent and inoffensive\r\nform, if one may use such expressions, for he was a most excellent man.\r\n\r\nI am even inclined to suppose that towards the end he had been entirely\r\nforgotten everywhere; but still it cannot be said that his name had\r\nnever been known.","It is beyond question that he had at one time belonged\r\nto a certain distinguished constellation of celebrated leaders of\r\nthe last generation, and at one time--though only for the briefest\r\nmoment--his name was pronounced by many hasty persons of that day almost\r\nas though it were on a level with the names of Tchaadaev, of Byelinsky,\r\nof Granovsky, and of Herzen, who had only just begun to write abroad.","But Stepan Trofimovitch's activity ceased almost at the moment it began,\r\nowing, so to say, to a \"vortex of combined circumstances.\" And would you\r\nbelieve it? It turned out afterwards that there had been no \"vortex\" and\r\neven no \"circumstances,\" at least in that connection. I only learned\r\nthe other day to my intense amazement, though on the most unimpeachable\r\nauthority, that Stepan Trofimovitch had lived among us in our province\r\nnot as an \"exile\" as we were accustomed to believe, and had never even\r\nbeen under police supervision at all.","Such is the force of imagination!\r\nAll his life he sincerely believed that in certain spheres he was a\r\nconstant cause of apprehension, that every step he took was watched\r\nand noted, and that each one of the three governors who succeeded one\r\nanother during twenty years in our province came with special and uneasy\r\nideas concerning him, which had, by higher powers, been impressed upon\r\neach before everything else, on receiving the appointment.","Had anyone\r\nassured the honest man on the most irrefutable grounds that he had\r\nnothing to be afraid of, he would certainly have been offended. Yet\r\nStepan Trofimovitch was a most intelligent and gifted man, even, so to\r\nsay, a man of science, though indeed, in science... well, in fact he\r\nhad not done such great things in science. I believe indeed he had done\r\nnothing at all. But that's very often the case, of course, with men of\r\nscience among us in Russia.","He came back from abroad and was brilliant in the capacity of lecturer\r\nat the university, towards the end of the forties. He only had time\r\nto deliver a few lectures, I believe they were about the Arabs; he\r\nmaintained, too, a brilliant thesis on the political and Hanseatic\r\nimportance of the German town Hanau, of which there was promise in the\r\nepoch between 1413 and 1428, and on the special and obscure reasons\r\nwhy that promise was never fulfilled.","This dissertation was a cruel\r\nand skilful thrust at the Slavophils of the day, and at once made him\r\nnumerous and irreconcilable enemies among them. Later on--after he had\r\nlost his post as lecturer, however--he published (by way of revenge,\r\nso to say, and to show them what a man they had lost) in a progressive\r\nmonthly review, which translated Dickens and advocated the views of\r\nGeorge Sand, the beginning of a very profound investigation into the\r\ncauses, I believe, of the extraordinary moral nobility of certain\r\nknights at a certain epoch or something of that nature.","Some lofty and exceptionally noble idea was maintained in it, anyway.\r\nIt was said afterwards that the continuation was hurriedly forbidden and\r\neven that the progressive review had to suffer for having printed the\r\nfirst part. That may very well have been so, for what was not possible\r\nin those days? Though, in this case, it is more likely that there\r\nwas nothing of the kind, and that the author himself was too lazy to\r\nconclude his essay.","He cut short his lectures on the Arabs because,\r\nsomehow and by someone (probably one of his reactionary enemies) a\r\nletter had been seized giving an account of certain circumstances, in\r\nconsequence of which someone had demanded an explanation from him. I\r\ndon't know whether the story is true, but it was asserted that at the\r\nsame time there was discovered in Petersburg a vast, unnatural, and\r\nillegal conspiracy of thirty people which almost shook society to its\r\nfoundations.","It was said that they were positively on the point of\r\ntranslating Fourier. As though of design a poem of Stepan Trofimovitch's\r\nwas seized in Moscow at that very time, though it had been written six\r\nyears before in Berlin in his earliest youth, and manuscript copies had\r\nbeen passed round a circle consisting of two poetical amateurs and one\r\nstudent. This poem is lying now on my table. No longer ago than last\r\nyear I received a recent copy in his own handwriting from Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch himself, signed by him, and bound in a splendid red leather\r\nbinding.","It is not without poetic merit, however, and even a certain\r\ntalent. It's strange, but in those days (or to be more exact, in the\r\nthirties) people were constantly composing in that style. I find it\r\ndifficult to describe the subject, for I really do not understand it.\r\nIt is some sort of an allegory in lyrical-dramatic form, recalling the\r\nsecond part of Faust. The scene opens with a chorus of women, followed\r\nby a chorus of men, then a chorus of incorporeal powers of some sort,\r\nand at the end of all a chorus of spirits not yet living but very\r\neager to come to life.","All these choruses sing about something very\r\nindefinite, for the most part about somebody's curse, but with a tinge\r\nof the higher humour. But the scene is suddenly changed. There begins a\r\nsort of \"festival of life\" at which even insects sing, a tortoise\r\ncomes on the scene with certain sacramental Latin words, and even, if\r\nI remember aright, a mineral sings about something that is a quite\r\ninanimate object.","In fact, they all sing continually, or if they\r\nconverse, it is simply to abuse one another vaguely, but again with\r\na tinge of higher meaning. At last the scene is changed again; a\r\nwilderness appears, and among the rocks there wanders a civilized young\r\nman who picks and sucks certain herbs. Asked by a fairy why he sucks\r\nthese herbs, he answers that, conscious of a superfluity of life in\r\nhimself, he seeks forgetfulness, and finds it in the juice of these\r\nherbs, but that his great desire is to lose his reason at once (a desire\r\npossibly superfluous).","Then a youth of indescribable beauty rides in on\r\na black steed, and an immense multitude of all nations follow him.\r\nThe youth represents death, for whom all the peoples are yearning. And\r\nfinally, in the last scene we are suddenly shown the Tower of Babel, and\r\ncertain athletes at last finish building it with a song of new hope, and\r\nwhen at length they complete the topmost pinnacle, the lord (of Olympia,\r\nlet us say) takes flight in a comic fashion, and man, grasping the\r\nsituation and seizing his place, at once begins a new life with new\r\ninsight into things.","Well, this poem was thought at that time to be\r\ndangerous. Last year I proposed to Stepan Trofimovitch to publish it,\r\non the ground of its perfect harmlessness nowadays, but he declined\r\nthe suggestion with evident dissatisfaction. My view of its complete\r\nharmlessness evidently displeased him, and I even ascribe to it a\r\ncertain coldness on his part, which lasted two whole months.\r\n\r\nAnd what do you think? Suddenly, almost at the time I proposed printing\r\nit here, our poem was published abroad in a collection of revolutionary\r\nverse, without the knowledge of Stepan Trofimovitch.","He was at\r\nfirst alarmed, rushed to the governor, and wrote a noble letter in\r\nself-defence to Petersburg. He read it to me twice, but did not send\r\nit, not knowing to whom to address it. In fact he was in a state of\r\nagitation for a whole month, but I am convinced that in the secret\r\nrecesses of his heart he was enormously flattered. He almost took the\r\ncopy of the collection to bed with him, and kept it hidden under his\r\nmattress in the daytime; he positively would not allow the women to turn\r\nhis bed, and although he expected every day a telegram, he held his head\r\nhigh.","No telegram came. Then he made friends with me again, which is a\r\nproof of the extreme kindness of his gentle and unresentful heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nOf course I don't assert that he had never suffered for his convictions\r\nat all, but I am fully convinced that he might have gone on lecturing\r\non his Arabs as long as he liked, if he had only given the necessary\r\nexplanations. But he was too lofty, and he proceeded with peculiar haste\r\nto assure himself that his career was ruined forever \"by the vortex of\r\ncircumstance.","\" And if the whole truth is to be told the real cause of\r\nthe change in his career was the very delicate proposition which had\r\nbeen made before and was then renewed by Varvara Petrovna Stavrogin, a\r\nlady of great wealth, the wife of a lieutenant-general, that he should\r\nundertake the education and the whole intellectual development of her\r\nonly son in the capacity of a superior sort of teacher and friend, to\r\nsay nothing of a magnificent salary.","This proposal had been made to\r\nhim the first time in Berlin, at the moment when he was first left a\r\nwidower. His first wife was a frivolous girl from our province, whom he\r\nmarried in his early and unthinking youth, and apparently he had had a\r\ngreat deal of trouble with this young person, charming as she was,\r\nowing to the lack of means for her support; and also from other, more\r\ndelicate, reasons.","She died in Paris after three years' separation\r\nfrom him, leaving him a son of five years old; \"the fruit of our first,\r\njoyous, and unclouded love,\" were the words the sorrowing father once\r\nlet fall in my presence.\r\n\r\nThe child had, from the first, been sent back to Russia, where he was\r\nbrought up in the charge of distant cousins in some remote region.\r\nStepan Trofimovitch had declined Varvara Petrovna's proposal on that\r\noccasion and had quickly married again, before the year was over, a\r\ntaciturn Berlin girl, and, what makes it more strange, there was no\r\nparticular necessity for him to do so.","But apart from his marriage there\r\nwere, it appears, other reasons for his declining the situation. He was\r\ntempted by the resounding fame of a professor, celebrated at that time,\r\nand he, in his turn, hastened to the lecturer's chair for which he had\r\nbeen preparing himself, to try his eagle wings in flight. But now with\r\nsinged wings he naturally remembered the proposition which even then had\r\nmade him hesitate.","The sudden death of his second wife, who did not live\r\na year with him, settled the matter decisively. To put it plainly it was\r\nall brought about by the passionate sympathy and priceless, so to\r\nspeak, classic friendship of Varvara Petrovna, if one may use such\r\nan expression of friendship. He flung himself into the arms of this\r\nfriendship, and his position was settled for more than twenty years.","I\r\nuse the expression \"flung himself into the arms of,\" but God forbid that\r\nanyone should fly to idle and superfluous conclusions. These embraces\r\nmust be understood only in the most loftily moral sense. The most\r\nrefined and delicate tie united these two beings, both so remarkable,\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nThe post of tutor was the more readily accepted too, as the property--a\r\nvery small one--left to Stepan Trofimovitch by his first wife was close\r\nto Skvoreshniki, the Stavrogins' magnificent estate on the outskirts of\r\nour provincial town.","Besides, in the stillness of his study, far from\r\nthe immense burden of university work, it was always possible to devote\r\nhimself to the service of science, and to enrich the literature of his\r\ncountry with erudite studies. These works did not appear. But on the\r\nother hand it did appear possible to spend the rest of his life, more\r\nthan twenty years, \"a reproach incarnate,\" so to speak, to his native\r\ncountry, in the words of a popular poet:\r\n\r\n_Reproach incarnate thou didst stand_\r\n_Erect before thy Fatherland,_\r\n_O Liberal idealist!_\r\n\r\nBut the person to whom the popular poet referred may perhaps have had\r\nthe right to adopt that pose for the rest of his life if he had wished\r\nto do so, though it must have been tedious.","Our Stepan Trofimovitch was,\r\nto tell the truth, only an imitator compared with such people; moreover,\r\nhe had grown weary of standing erect and often lay down for a while.\r\nBut, to do him justice, the \"incarnation of reproach\" was preserved even\r\nin the recumbent attitude, the more so as that was quite sufficient for\r\nthe province. You should have seen him at our club when he sat down to\r\ncards. His whole figure seemed to exclaim \"Cards! Me sit down to whist\r\nwith you! Is it consistent? Who is responsible for it? Who has shattered\r\nmy energies and turned them to whist? Ah, perish, Russia!\" and he would\r\nmajestically trump with a heart.","And to tell the truth he dearly loved a game of cards, which led him,\r\nespecially in later years, into frequent and unpleasant skirmishes with\r\nVarvara Petrovna, particularly as he was always losing. But of that\r\nlater. I will only observe that he was a man of tender conscience (that\r\nis, sometimes) and so was often depressed. In the course of his twenty\r\nyears' friendship with Varvara Petrovna he used regularly, three or\r\nfour times a year, to sink into a state of \"patriotic grief,\" as it\r\nwas called among us, or rather really into an attack of spleen, but our\r\nestimable Varvara Petrovna preferred the former phrase.","Of late years\r\nhis grief had begun to be not only patriotic, but at times alcoholic\r\ntoo; but Varvara Petrovna's alertness succeeded in keeping him all his\r\nlife from trivial inclinations. And he needed someone to look after him\r\nindeed, for he sometimes behaved very oddly: in the midst of his exalted\r\nsorrow he would begin laughing like any simple peasant. There were\r\nmoments when he began to take a humorous tone even about himself.","But\r\nthere was nothing Varvara Petrovna dreaded so much as a humorous tone.\r\nShe was a woman of the classic type, a female M√¶cenas, invariably\r\nguided only by the highest considerations. The influence of this exalted\r\nlady over her poor friend for twenty years is a fact of the first\r\nimportance. I shall need to speak of her more particularly, which I now\r\nproceed to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThere are strange friendships.","The two friends are always ready to fly\r\nat one another, and go on like that all their lives, and yet they cannot\r\nseparate. Parting, in fact, is utterly impossible. The one who has begun\r\nthe quarrel and separated will be the first to fall ill and even die,\r\nperhaps, if the separation comes off. I know for a positive fact that\r\nseveral times Stepan Trofimovitch has jumped up from the sofa and\r\nbeaten the wall with his fists after the most intimate and emotional\r\n_t√™te-√†-t√™te_ with Varvara Petrovna.","This proceeding was by no means an empty symbol; indeed, on one\r\noccasion, he broke some plaster off the wall. It may be asked how I come\r\nto know such delicate details. What if I were myself a witness of it?\r\nWhat if Stepan Trofimovitch himself has, on more than one occasion,\r\nsobbed on my shoulder while he described to me in lurid colours all his\r\nmost secret feelings. (And what was there he did not say at such times!)\r\nBut what almost always happened after these tearful outbreaks was that\r\nnext day he was ready to crucify himself for his ingratitude.","He would\r\nsend for me in a hurry or run over to see me simply to assure me that\r\nVarvara Petrovna was \"an angel of honour and delicacy, while he was very\r\nmuch the opposite.\" He did not only run to confide in me, but, on more\r\nthan one occasion, described it all to her in the most eloquent letter,\r\nand wrote a full signed confession that no longer ago than the day\r\nbefore he had told an outsider that she kept him out of vanity, that\r\nshe was envious of his talents and erudition, that she hated him and was\r\nonly afraid to express her hatred openly, dreading that he would leave\r\nher and so damage her literary reputation, that this drove him to\r\nself-contempt, and he was resolved to die a violent death, and that he\r\nwas waiting for the final word from her which would decide everything,\r\nand so on and so on in the same style.","You can fancy after this what\r\nan hysterical pitch the nervous outbreaks of this most innocent of\r\nall fifty-year-old infants sometimes reached! I once read one of these\r\nletters after some quarrel between them, arising from a trivial matter,\r\nbut growing venomous as it went on. I was horrified and besought him not\r\nto send it.\r\n\r\n\"I must... more honourable... duty... I shall die if I don't confess\r\neverything, everything!\" he answered almost in delirium, and he did send\r\nthe letter.","That was the difference between them, that Varvara Petrovna never would\r\nhave sent such a letter. It is true that he was passionately fond of\r\nwriting, he wrote to her though he lived in the same house, and during\r\nhysterical interludes he would write two letters a day. I know for a\r\nfact that she always read these letters with the greatest attention,\r\neven when she received two a day, and after reading them she put them\r\naway in a special drawer, sorted and annotated; moreover, she pondered\r\nthem in her heart.","But she kept her friend all day without an answer,\r\nmet him as though there were nothing the matter, exactly as though\r\nnothing special had happened the day before. By degrees she broke him in\r\nso completely that at last he did not himself dare to allude to what had\r\nhappened the day before, and only glanced into her eyes at times. But\r\nshe never forgot anything, while he sometimes forgot too quickly, and\r\nencouraged by her composure he would not infrequently, if friends came\r\nin, laugh and make jokes over the champagne the very same day.","With what\r\nmalignancy she must have looked at him at such moments, while he noticed\r\nnothing! Perhaps in a week's time, a month's time, or even six months\r\nlater, chancing to recall some phrase in such a letter, and then the\r\nwhole letter with all its attendant circumstances, he would suddenly\r\ngrow hot with shame, and be so upset that he fell ill with one of his\r\nattacks of \"summer cholera.\" These attacks of a sort of \"summer cholera\"\r\nwere, in some cases, the regular consequence of his nervous agitations\r\nand were an interesting peculiarity of his physical constitution.","No doubt Varvara Petrovna did very often hate him. But there was one\r\nthing he had not discerned up to the end: that was that he had become\r\nfor her a son, her creation, even, one may say, her invention; he had\r\nbecome flesh of her flesh, and she kept and supported him not simply\r\nfrom \"envy of his talents.\" And how wounded she must have been by such\r\nsuppositions! An inexhaustible love for him lay concealed in her heart\r\nin the midst of continual hatred, jealousy, and contempt.","She would not\r\nlet a speck of dust fall upon him, coddled him up for twenty-two years,\r\nwould not have slept for nights together if there were the faintest\r\nbreath against his reputation as a poet, a learned man, and a public\r\ncharacter. She had invented him, and had been the first to believe in\r\nher own invention. He was, after a fashion, her day-dream.... But in\r\nreturn she exacted a great deal from him, sometimes even slavishness.","It\r\nwas incredible how long she harboured resentment. I have two anecdotes\r\nto tell about that.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, just at the time when the first rumours of the\r\nemancipation of the serfs were in the air, when all Russia was exulting\r\nand making ready for a complete regeneration, Varvara Petrovna was\r\nvisited by a baron from Petersburg, a man of the highest connections,\r\nand very closely associated with the new reform.","Varvara Petrovna prized\r\nsuch visits highly, as her connections in higher circles had grown\r\nweaker and weaker since the death of her husband, and had at last ceased\r\naltogether. The baron spent an hour drinking tea with her. There was no\r\none else present but Stepan Trofimovitch, whom Varvara Petrovna invited\r\nand exhibited. The baron had heard something about him before or\r\naffected to have done so, but paid little attention to him at tea.","Stepan Trofimovitch of course was incapable of making a social blunder,\r\nand his manners were most elegant. Though I believe he was by no means\r\nof exalted origin, yet it happened that he had from earliest childhood\r\nbeen brought up in a Moscow household--of high rank, and consequently\r\nwas well bred. He spoke French like a Parisian. Thus the baron was to\r\nhave seen from the first glance the sort of people with whom Varvara\r\nPetrovna surrounded herself, even in provincial seclusion.","But things\r\ndid not fall out like this. When the baron positively asserted the\r\nabsolute truth of the rumours of the great reform, which were then\r\nonly just beginning to be heard, Stepan Trofimovitch could not contain\r\nhimself, and suddenly shouted \"Hurrah!\" and even made some gesticulation\r\nindicative of delight. His ejaculation was not over-loud and quite\r\npolite, his delight was even perhaps premeditated, and his gesture\r\npurposely studied before the looking-glass half an hour before tea.","But\r\nsomething must have been amiss with it, for the baron permitted himself\r\na faint smile, though he, at once, with extraordinary courtesy, put in\r\na phrase concerning the universal and befitting emotion of all Russian\r\nhearts in view of the great event. Shortly afterwards he took his\r\nleave and at parting did not forget to hold out two fingers to Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch. On returning to the drawing-room Varvara Petrovna was\r\nat first silent for two or three minutes, and seemed to be looking for\r\nsomething on the table.","Then she turned to Stepan Trofimovitch, and with\r\npale face and flashing eyes she hissed in a whisper:\r\n\r\n\"I shall never forgive you for that!\"\r\n\r\nNext day she met her friend as though nothing had happened, she never\r\nreferred to the incident, but thirteen years afterwards, at a tragic\r\nmoment, she recalled it and reproached him with it, and she turned pale,\r\njust as she had done thirteen years before.","Only twice in the course of\r\nher life did she say to him:\r\n\r\n\"I shall never forgive you for that!\"\r\n\r\nThe incident with the baron was the second time, but the first incident\r\nwas so characteristic and had so much influence on the fate of Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch that I venture to refer to that too.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1855, in spring-time, in May, just after the news had reached\r\nSkvoreshniki of the death of Lieutenant-General Stavrogin, a frivolous\r\nold gentleman who died of a stomach ailment on the way to the Crimea,\r\nwhere he was hastening to join the army on active service.","Varvara\r\nPetrovna was left a widow and put on deep mourning. She could not, it is\r\ntrue, deplore his death very deeply, since, for the last four years,\r\nshe had been completely separated from him owing to incompatibility of\r\ntemper, and was giving him an allowance. (The Lieutenant-General himself\r\nhad nothing but one hundred and fifty serfs and his pay, besides his\r\nposition and his connections. All the money and Skvoreshniki belonged to\r\nVarvara Petrovna, the only daughter of a very rich contractor.",") Yet she\r\nwas shocked by the suddenness of the news, and retired into complete\r\nsolitude. Stepan Trofimovitch, of course, was always at her side.\r\n\r\nMay was in its full beauty. The evenings were exquisite. The wild cherry\r\nwas in flower. The two friends walked every evening in the garden and\r\nused to sit till nightfall in the arbour, and pour out their thoughts\r\nand feelings to one another. They had poetic moments.","Under the\r\ninfluence of the change in her position Varvara Petrovna talked more\r\nthan usual. She, as it were, clung to the heart of her friend, and this\r\ncontinued for several evenings. A strange idea suddenly came over Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch: \"Was not the inconsolable widow reckoning upon him, and\r\nexpecting from him, when her mourning was over, the offer of his hand?\"\r\nA cynical idea, but the very loftiness of a man's nature sometimes\r\nincreases a disposition to cynical ideas if only from the many-sidedness\r\nof his culture.","He began to look more deeply into it, and thought it\r\nseemed like it. He pondered: \"Her fortune is immense, of course, but...\"\r\nVarvara Petrovna certainly could not be called a beauty. She was a\r\ntall, yellow, bony woman with an extremely long face, suggestive of a\r\nhorse. Stepan Trofimovitch hesitated more and more, he was tortured by\r\ndoubts, he positively shed tears of indecision once or twice (he wept\r\nnot infrequently).","In the evenings, that is to say in the arbour, his\r\ncountenance involuntarily began to express something capricious and\r\nironical, something coquettish and at the same time condescending. This\r\nis apt to happen as it were by accident, and the more gentlemanly the\r\nman the more noticeable it is. Goodness only knows what one is to think\r\nabout it, but it's most likely that nothing had begun working in her\r\nheart that could have fully justified Stepan Trofimovitch's suspicions.","Moreover, she would not have changed her name, Stavrogin, for his\r\nname, famous as it was. Perhaps there was nothing in it but the play\r\nof femininity on her side; the manifestation of an unconscious feminine\r\nyearning so natural in some extremely feminine types. However, I won't\r\nanswer for it; the depths of the female heart have not been explored to\r\nthis day. But I must continue.\r\n\r\nIt is to be supposed that she soon inwardly guessed the significance of\r\nher friend's strange expression; she was quick and observant, and he was\r\nsometimes extremely guileless.","But the evenings went on as before, and\r\ntheir conversations were just as poetic and interesting. And behold\r\non one occasion at nightfall, after the most lively and poetical\r\nconversation, they parted affectionately, warmly pressing each other's\r\nhands at the steps of the lodge where Stepan Trofimovitch slept. Every\r\nsummer he used to move into this little lodge which stood adjoining the\r\nhuge seignorial house of Skvoreshniki, almost in the garden.","He had only\r\njust gone in, and in restless hesitation taken a cigar, and not having\r\nyet lighted it, was standing weary and motionless before the open\r\nwindow, gazing at the light feathery white clouds gliding around the\r\nbright moon, when suddenly a faint rustle made him start and turn\r\nround. Varvara Petrovna, whom he had left only four minutes earlier,\r\nwas standing before him again. Her yellow face was almost blue.","Her lips\r\nwere pressed tightly together and twitching at the corners. For ten full\r\nseconds she looked him in the eyes in silence with a firm relentless\r\ngaze, and suddenly whispered rapidly:\r\n\r\n\"I shall never forgive you for this!\"\r\n\r\nWhen, ten years later, Stepan Trofimovitch, after closing the doors,\r\ntold me this melancholy tale in a whisper, he vowed that he had been so\r\npetrified on the spot that he had not seen or heard how Varvara Petrovna\r\nhad disappeared.","As she never once afterwards alluded to the incident\r\nand everything went on as though nothing had happened, he was all his\r\nlife inclined to the idea that it was all an hallucination, a symptom\r\nof illness, the more so as he was actually taken ill that very night\r\nand was indisposed for a fortnight, which, by the way, cut short the\r\ninterviews in the arbour.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of his vague theory of hallucination he seemed every day,\r\nall his life, to be expecting the continuation, and, so to say, the\r\n_d√©nouement_ of this affair.","He could not believe that that was the end of\r\nit! And if so he must have looked strangely sometimes at his friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nShe had herself designed the costume for him which he wore for the rest\r\nof his life. It was elegant and characteristic; a long black frock-coat,\r\nbuttoned almost to the top, but stylishly cut; a soft hat (in summer a\r\nstraw hat) with a wide brim, a white batiste cravat with a full bow\r\nand hanging ends, a cane with a silver knob; his hair flowed on to his\r\nshoulders.","It was dark brown, and only lately had begun to get a little\r\ngrey. He was clean-shaven. He was said to have been very handsome in his\r\nyouth. And, to my mind, he was still an exceptionally impressive figure\r\neven in old age. Besides, who can talk of old age at fifty-three?\r\nFrom his special pose as a patriot, however, he did not try to appear\r\nyounger, but seemed rather to pride himself on the solidity of his\r\nage, and, dressed as described, tall and thin with flowing hair, he\r\nlooked almost like a patriarch, or even more like the portrait of the\r\npoet Kukolnik, engraved in the edition of his works published in 1830 or\r\nthereabouts.","This resemblance was especially striking when he sat in the\r\ngarden in summertime, on a seat under a bush of flowering lilac, with\r\nboth hands propped on his cane and an open book beside him, musing\r\npoetically over the setting sun. In regard to books I may remark that\r\nhe came in later years rather to avoid reading. But that was only quite\r\ntowards the end. The papers and magazines ordered in great profusion by\r\nVarvara Petrovna he was continually reading.","He never lost interest in\r\nthe successes of Russian literature either, though he always maintained\r\na dignified attitude with regard to them. He was at one time engrossed\r\nin the study of our home and foreign politics, but he soon gave up the\r\nundertaking with a gesture of despair. It sometimes happened that he\r\nwould take De Tocqueville with him into the garden while he had a Paul\r\nde Kock in his pocket.","But these are trivial matters.\r\n\r\nI must observe in parenthesis about the portrait of Kukolnik; the\r\nengraving had first come into the hands of Varvara Petrovna when she was\r\na girl in a high-class boarding-school in Moscow. She fell in love with\r\nthe portrait at once, after the habit of all girls at school who fall\r\nin love with anything they come across, as well as with their teachers,\r\nespecially the drawing and writing masters.","What is interesting in this,\r\nthough, is not the characteristics of girls but the fact that even at\r\nfifty Varvara Petrovna kept the engraving among her most intimate and\r\ntreasured possessions, so that perhaps it was only on this account that\r\nshe had designed for Stepan Trofimovitch a costume somewhat like the\r\npoet's in the engraving. But that, of course, is a trifling matter too.\r\n\r\nFor the first years or, more accurately, for the first half of the time\r\nhe spent with Varvara Petrovna, Stepan Trofimovitch was still planning a\r\nbook and every day seriously prepared to write it.","But during the later\r\nperiod he must have forgotten even what he had done. More and more\r\nfrequently he used to say to us:\r\n\r\n\"I seem to be ready for work, my materials are collected, yet the work\r\ndoesn't get done! Nothing is done!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he would bow his head dejectedly. No doubt this was calculated\r\nto increase his prestige in our eyes as a martyr to science, but he\r\nhimself was longing for something else.","\"They have forgotten me! I'm\r\nno use to anyone!\" broke from him more than once. This intensified\r\ndepression took special hold of him towards the end of the fifties.\r\nVarvara Petrovna realised at last that it was a serious matter. Besides,\r\nshe could not endure the idea that her friend was forgotten and useless.\r\nTo distract him and at the same time to renew his fame she carried him\r\noff to Moscow, where she had fashionable acquaintances in the\r\nliterary and scientific world; but it appeared that Moscow too was\r\nunsatisfactory.","It was a peculiar time; something new was beginning, quite unlike the\r\nstagnation of the past, something very strange too, though it was felt\r\neverywhere, even at Skvoreshniki. Rumours of all sorts reached us. The\r\nfacts were generally more or less well known, but it was evident that\r\nin addition to the facts there were certain ideas accompanying them,\r\nand what's more, a great number of them. And this was perplexing.","It was\r\nimpossible to estimate and find out exactly what was the drift of these\r\nideas. Varvara Petrovna was prompted by the feminine composition of her\r\ncharacter to a compelling desire to penetrate the secret of them.\r\nShe took to reading newspapers and magazines, prohibited publications\r\nprinted abroad and even the revolutionary manifestoes which were just\r\nbeginning to appear at the time (she was able to procure them all); but\r\nthis only set her head in a whirl.","She fell to writing letters; she got\r\nfew answers, and they grew more incomprehensible as time went on. Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch was solemnly called upon to explain \"these ideas\" to\r\nher once for all, but she remained distinctly dissatisfied with his\r\nexplanations.\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch's view of the general movement was supercilious in\r\nthe extreme. In his eyes all it amounted to was that he was forgotten\r\nand of no use.","At last his name was mentioned, at first in periodicals\r\npublished abroad as that of an exiled martyr, and immediately afterwards\r\nin Petersburg as that of a former star in a celebrated constellation.\r\nHe was even for some reason compared with Radishtchev. Then someone\r\nprinted the statement that he was dead and promised an obituary notice\r\nof him. Stepan Trofimovitch instantly perked up and assumed an air of\r\nimmense dignity.","All his disdain for his contemporaries evaporated and\r\nhe began to cherish the dream of joining the movement and showing his\r\npowers. Varvara Petrovna's faith in everything instantly revived and she\r\nwas thrown into a violent ferment. It was decided to go to Petersburg\r\nwithout a moment's delay, to find out everything on the spot, to go into\r\neverything personally, and, if possible, to throw themselves heart and\r\nsoul into the new movement.","Among other things she announced that she\r\nwas prepared to found a magazine of her own, and henceforward to devote\r\nher whole life to it. Seeing what it had come to, Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nbecame more condescending than ever, and on the journey began to behave\r\nalmost patronisingly to Varvara Petrovna--which she at once laid up in\r\nher heart against him. She had, however, another very important reason\r\nfor the trip, which was to renew her connections in higher spheres.","It was necessary, as far as she could, to remind the world of her\r\nexistence, or at any rate to make an attempt to do so. The ostensible\r\nobject of the journey was to see her only son, who was just finishing\r\nhis studies at a Petersburg lyceum.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThey spent almost the whole winter season in Petersburg. But by Lent\r\neverything burst like a rainbow-coloured soap-bubble.\r\n\r\nTheir dreams were dissipated, and the muddle, far from being cleared\r\nup, had become even more revoltingly incomprehensible.","To begin with,\r\nconnections with the higher spheres were not established, or only on a\r\nmicroscopic scale, and by humiliating exertions. In her mortification\r\nVarvara Petrovna threw herself heart and soul into the \"new ideas,\" and\r\nbegan giving evening receptions. She invited literary people, and they\r\nwere brought to her at once in multitudes. Afterwards they came of\r\nthemselves without invitation, one brought another.","Never had she seen\r\nsuch literary men. They were incredibly vain, but quite open in their\r\nvanity, as though they were performing a duty by the display of it.\r\nSome (but by no means all) of them even turned up intoxicated, seeming,\r\nhowever, to detect in this a peculiar, only recently discovered, merit.\r\nThey were all strangely proud of something. On every face was written\r\nthat they had only just discovered some extremely important secret.","They\r\nabused one another, and took credit to themselves for it. It was rather\r\ndifficult to find out what they had written exactly, but among them\r\nthere were critics, novelists, dramatists, satirists, and exposers of\r\nabuses. Stepan Trofimovitch penetrated into their very highest circle\r\nfrom which the movement was directed. Incredible heights had to be\r\nscaled to reach this group; but they gave him a cordial welcome, though,\r\nof course, no one of them had ever heard of him or knew anything about\r\nhim except that he \"represented an idea.","\" His manoeuvres among them\r\nwere so successful that he got them twice to Varvara Petrovna's salon\r\nin spite of their Olympian grandeur. These people were very serious and\r\nvery polite; they behaved nicely; the others were evidently afraid of\r\nthem; but it was obvious that they had no time to spare. Two or three\r\nformer literary celebrities who happened to be in Petersburg, and with\r\nwhom Varvara Petrovna had long maintained a most refined correspondence,\r\ncame also.","But to her surprise these genuine and quite indubitable\r\ncelebrities were stiller than water, humbler than the grass, and some\r\nof them simply hung on to this new rabble, and were shamefully cringing\r\nbefore them. At first Stepan Trofimovitch was a success. People caught\r\nat him and began to exhibit him at public literary gatherings. The first\r\ntime he came on to the platform at some public reading in which he was\r\nto take part, he was received with enthusiastic clapping which lasted\r\nfor five minutes.","He recalled this with tears nine years afterwards,\r\nthough rather from his natural artistic sensibility than from gratitude.\r\n\"I swear, and I'm ready to bet,\" he declared (but only to me, and in\r\nsecret), \"that not one of that audience knew anything whatever about\r\nme.\" A noteworthy admission. He must have had a keen intelligence since\r\nhe was capable of grasping his position so clearly even on the platform,\r\neven in such a state of exaltation; it also follows that he had not\r\na keen intelligence if, nine years afterwards, he could not recall\r\nit without mortification.","He was made to sign two or three collective\r\nprotests (against what he did not know); he signed them. Varvara\r\nPetrovna too was made to protest against some \"disgraceful action\" and\r\nshe signed too. The majority of these new people, however, though they\r\nvisited Varvara Petrovna, felt themselves for some reason called upon\r\nto regard her with contempt, and with undisguised irony. Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch hinted to me at bitter moments afterwards that it was from\r\nthat time she had been envious of him.","She saw, of course, that she\r\ncould not get on with these people, yet she received them eagerly,\r\nwith all the hysterical impatience of her sex, and, what is more, she\r\nexpected something. At her parties she talked little, although she could\r\ntalk, but she listened the more. They talked of the abolition of the\r\ncensorship, and of phonetic spelling, of the substitution of the Latin\r\ncharacters for the Russian alphabet, of someone's having been sent into\r\nexile the day before, of some scandal, of the advantage of splitting\r\nRussia into nationalities united in a free federation, of the abolition\r\nof the army and the navy, of the restoration of Poland as far as\r\nthe Dnieper, of the peasant reforms, and of the manifestoes, of the\r\nabolition of the hereditary principle, of the family, of children, and\r\nof priests, of women's rights, of Kraevsky's house, for which no one\r\never seemed able to forgive Mr.","Kraevsky, and so on, and so on. It was\r\nevident that in this mob of new people there were many impostors, but\r\nundoubtedly there were also many honest and very attractive people, in\r\nspite of some surprising characteristics in them. The honest ones were\r\nfar more difficult to understand than the coarse and dishonest, but it\r\nwas impossible to tell which was being made a tool of by the other.\r\nWhen Varvara Petrovna announced her idea of founding a magazine, people\r\nflocked to her in even larger numbers, but charges of being a capitalist\r\nand an exploiter of labour were showered upon her to her face.","The\r\nrudeness of these accusations was only equalled by their unexpectedness.\r\nThe aged General Ivan Ivanovitch Drozdov, an old friend and comrade\r\nof the late General Stavrogin's, known to us all here as an extremely\r\nstubborn and irritable, though very estimable, man (in his own way, of\r\ncourse), who ate a great deal, and was dreadfully afraid of atheism,\r\nquarrelled at one of Varvara Petrovna's parties with a distinguished\r\nyoung man.","The latter at the first word exclaimed, \"You must be a\r\ngeneral if you talk like that,\" meaning that he could find no word of\r\nabuse worse than \"general.\"\r\n\r\nIvan Ivanovitch flew into a terrible passion: \"Yes, sir, I am a general,\r\nand a lieutenant-general, and I have served my Tsar, and you, sir, are a\r\npuppy and an infidel!\"\r\n\r\nAn outrageous scene followed. Next day the incident was exposed in\r\nprint, and they began getting up a collective protest against Varvara\r\nPetrovna's disgraceful conduct in not having immediately turned\r\nthe general out.","In an illustrated paper there appeared a malignant\r\ncaricature in which Varvara Petrovna, Stepan Trofimovitch, and General\r\nDrozdov were depicted as three reactionary friends. There were verses\r\nattached to this caricature written by a popular poet especially for the\r\noccasion. I may observe, for my own part, that many persons of general's\r\nrank certainly have an absurd habit of saying, \"I have served my\r\nTsar\".","..just as though they had not the same Tsar as all the rest of us,\r\ntheir simple fellow-subjects, but had a special Tsar of their own.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible, of course, to remain any longer in Petersburg, all\r\nthe more so as Stepan Trofimovitch was overtaken by a complete fiasco.\r\nHe could not resist talking of the claims of art, and they laughed\r\nat him more loudly as time went on. At his last lecture he thought to\r\nimpress them with patriotic eloquence, hoping to touch their hearts,\r\nand reckoning on the respect inspired by his \"persecution.","\" He did\r\nnot attempt to dispute the uselessness and absurdity of the word\r\n\"fatherland,\" acknowledged the pernicious influence of religion, but\r\nfirmly and loudly declared that boots were of less consequence than\r\nPushkin; of much less, indeed. He was hissed so mercilessly that he\r\nburst into tears, there and then, on the platform. Varvara Petrovna took\r\nhim home more dead than alive. _\"On m'a trait√© comme un vieux bonnet\r\nde coton,\"_ he babbled senselessly.","She was looking after him all night,\r\ngiving him laurel-drops and repeating to him till daybreak, \"You will\r\nstill be of use; you will still make your mark; you will be appreciated\r\n... in another place.\"\r\n\r\nEarly next morning five literary men called on Varvara Petrovna, three\r\nof them complete strangers, whom she had never set eyes on before. With\r\na stern air they informed her that they had looked into the question of\r\nher magazine, and had brought her their decision on the subject.","Varvara\r\nPetrovna had never authorised anyone to look into or decide anything\r\nconcerning her magazine. Their decision was that, having founded the\r\nmagazine, she should at once hand it over to them with the capital to\r\nrun it, on the basis of a co-operative society. She herself was to\r\ngo back to Skvoreshniki, not forgetting to take with her Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch, who was \"out of date.\" From delicacy they agreed to\r\nrecognise the right of property in her case, and to send her every year\r\na sixth part of the net profits.","What was most touching about it\r\nwas that of these five men, four certainly were not actuated by any\r\nmercenary motive, and were simply acting in the interests of the\r\n\"cause.\"\r\n\r\n\"We came away utterly at a loss,\" Stepan Trofimovitch used to say\r\nafterwards. \"I couldn't make head or tail of it, and kept muttering, I\r\nremember, to the rumble of the train:\r\n\r\n     'Vyek, and vyek, and Lyov Kambek,\r\n     Lyov Kambek and vyek, and vyek.","'\r\n\r\nand goodness knows what, all the way to Moscow. It was only in Moscow\r\nthat I came to myself--as though we really might find something\r\ndifferent there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my friends!\" he would exclaim to us sometimes with fervour, \"you\r\ncannot imagine what wrath and sadness overcome your whole soul when a\r\ngreat idea, which you have long cherished as holy, is caught up by the\r\nignorant and dragged forth before fools like themselves into the street,\r\nand you suddenly meet it in the market unrecognisable, in the mud,\r\nabsurdly set up, without proportion, without harmony, the plaything of\r\nfoolish louts! No! In our day it was not so, and it was not this for\r\nwhich we strove.","No, no, not this at all. I don't recognise it.... Our\r\nday will come again and will turn all the tottering fabric of to-day\r\ninto a true path. If not, what will happen?...\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nImmediately on their return from Petersburg Varvara Petrovna sent her\r\nfriend abroad to \"recruit\"; and, indeed, it was necessary for them to\r\npart for a time, she felt that. Stepan Trofimovitch was delighted to go.\r\n\r\n\"There I shall revive!\" he exclaimed.","\"There, at last, I shall set to\r\nwork!\" But in the first of his letters from Berlin he struck his usual\r\nnote:\r\n\r\n\"My heart is broken!\" he wrote to Varvara Petrovna. \"I can forget\r\nnothing! Here, in Berlin, everything brings back to me my old past, my\r\nfirst raptures and my first agonies. Where is she? Where are they both?\r\nWhere are you two angels of whom I was never worthy? Where is my son, my\r\nbeloved son? And last of all, where am I, where is my old self, strong\r\nas steel, firm as a rock, when now some Andreev, our orthodox clown with\r\na beard, _peut briser mon existence en deux_\"--and so on.","As for Stepan Trofimovitch's son, he had only seen him twice in his\r\nlife, the first time when he was born and the second time lately in\r\nPetersburg, where the young man was preparing to enter the university.\r\nThe boy had been all his life, as we have said already, brought up by\r\nhis aunts (at Varvara Petrovna's expense) in a remote province, nearly\r\nsix hundred miles from Skvoreshniki. As for Andreev, he was nothing\r\nmore or less than our local shopkeeper, a very eccentric fellow, a\r\nself-taught arch√¶ologist who had a passion for collecting Russian\r\nantiquities and sometimes tried to outshine Stepan Trofimovitch in\r\nerudition and in the progressiveness of his opinions.","This worthy\r\nshopkeeper, with a grey beard and silver-rimmed spectacles, still owed\r\nStepan Trofimovitch four hundred roubles for some acres of timber he had\r\nbought on the latter's little estate (near Skvoreshniki). Though Varvara\r\nPetrovna had liberally provided her friend with funds when she sent him\r\nto Berlin, yet Stepan Trofimovitch had, before starting, particularly\r\nreckoned on getting that four hundred roubles, probably for his secret\r\nexpenditure, and was ready to cry when Andreev asked leave to defer\r\npayment for a month, which he had a right to do, since he had brought\r\nthe first installments of the money almost six months in advance to meet\r\nStepan Trofimovitch's special need at the time.","Varvara Petrovna read this first letter greedily, and underlining in\r\npencil the exclamation: \"Where are they both?\" numbered it and put it\r\naway in a drawer. He had, of course, referred to his two deceased wives.\r\nThe second letter she received from Berlin was in a different strain:\r\n\r\n\"I am working twelve hours out of the twenty-four.\" (\"Eleven would be\r\nenough,\" muttered Varvara Petrovna.) \"I'm rummaging in the libraries,\r\ncollating, copying, rushing about.","I've visited the professors. I have\r\nrenewed my acquaintance with the delightful Dundasov family. What a\r\ncharming creature Lizaveta Nikolaevna is even now! She sends you her\r\ngreetings. Her young husband and three nephews are all in Berlin. I\r\nsit up talking till daybreak with the young people and we have almost\r\nAthenian evenings, Athenian, I mean, only in their intellectual subtlety\r\nand refinement.","Everything is in noble style; a great deal of music,\r\nSpanish airs, dreams of the regeneration of all humanity, ideas\r\nof eternal beauty, of the Sistine Madonna, light interspersed with\r\ndarkness, but there are spots even on the sun! Oh, my friend, my noble,\r\nfaithful friend! In heart I am with you and am yours; with you alone,\r\nalways, _en tout pays_, even in _le pays de Makar et de ses veaux_, of\r\nwhich we often used to talk in agitation in Petersburg, do you remember,\r\nbefore we came away.","I think of it with a smile. Crossing the frontier I\r\nfelt myself in safety, a sensation, strange and new, for the first time\r\nafter so many years\"--and so on and so on.\r\n\r\n\"Come, it's all nonsense!\" Varvara Petrovna commented, folding up that\r\nletter too. \"If he's up till daybreak with his Athenian nights, he isn't\r\nat his books for twelve hours a day. Was he drunk when he wrote it?\r\nThat Dundasov woman dares to send me greetings! But there, let him amuse\r\nhimself!\"\r\n\r\nThe phrase \"_dans le pays de Makar et de ses veaux_\" meant: \"wherever\r\nMakar may drive his calves.","\" Stepan Trofimovitch sometimes purposely\r\ntranslated Russian proverbs and traditional sayings into French in the\r\nmost stupid way, though no doubt he was able to understand and translate\r\nthem better. But he did it from a feeling that it was chic, and thought\r\nit witty.\r\n\r\nBut he did not amuse himself for long. He could not hold out for four\r\nmonths, and was soon flying back to Skvoreshniki. His last letters\r\nconsisted of nothing but outpourings of the most sentimental love for\r\nhis absent friend, and were literally wet with tears.","There are natures\r\nextremely attached to home like lap-dogs. The meeting of the friends was\r\nenthusiastic. Within two days everything was as before and even duller\r\nthan before. \"My friend,\" Stepan Trofimovitch said to me a fortnight\r\nafter, in dead secret, \"I have discovered something awful for me...\r\nsomething new: _je suis un simple_ dependent, _et rien de plus! Mais\r\nr-r-rien de plus._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nAfter this we had a period of stagnation which lasted nine years.","The hysterical outbreaks and sobbings on my shoulder that recurred at\r\nregular intervals did not in the least mar our prosperity. I wonder that\r\nStepan Trofimovitch did not grow stout during this period. His nose was\r\na little redder, and his manner had gained in urbanity, that was all. By\r\ndegrees a circle of friends had formed around him, although it was never\r\na very large one. Though Varvara Petrovna had little to do with the\r\ncircle, yet we all recognised her as our patroness.","After the lesson she\r\nhad received in Petersburg, she settled down in our town for good. In\r\nwinter she lived in her town house and spent the summer on her estate\r\nin the neighbourhood. She had never enjoyed so much consequence and\r\nprestige in our provincial society as during the last seven years of\r\nthis period, that is up to the time of the appointment of our present\r\ngovernor. Our former governor, the mild Ivan Ossipovitch, who will never\r\nbe forgotten among us, was a near relation of Varvara Petrovna's, and\r\nhad at one time been under obligations to her.","His wife trembled at the\r\nvery thought of displeasing her, while the homage paid her by provincial\r\nsociety was carried almost to a pitch that suggested idolatry. So Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch, too, had a good time. He was a member of the club, lost at\r\ncards majestically, and was everywhere treated with respect, though\r\nmany people regarded him only as a \"learned man.\" Later on, when Varvara\r\nPetrovna allowed him to live in a separate house, we enjoyed greater\r\nfreedom than before.","Twice a week we used to meet at his house. We were\r\na merry party, especially when he was not sparing of the champagne. The\r\nwine came from the shop of the same Andreev. The bill was paid twice\r\na year by Varvara Petrovna, and on the day it was paid Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch almost invariably suffered from an attack of his \"summer\r\ncholera.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the first members of our circle was Liputin, an elderly\r\nprovincial official, and a great liberal, who was reputed in the town\r\nto be an atheist.","He had married for the second time a young and pretty\r\nwife with a dowry, and had, besides, three grown-up daughters. He\r\nbrought up his family in the fear of God, and kept a tight hand over\r\nthem. He was extremely stingy, and out of his salary had bought himself\r\na house and amassed a fortune. He was an uncomfortable sort of man, and\r\nhad not been in the service. He was not much respected in the town, and\r\nwas not received in the best circles.","Moreover, he was a scandal-monger,\r\nand had more than once had to smart for his back-biting, for which he\r\nhad been badly punished by an officer, and again by a country gentleman,\r\nthe respectable head of a family. But we liked his wit, his inquiring\r\nmind, his peculiar, malicious liveliness. Varvara Petrovna disliked him,\r\nbut he always knew how to make up to her.\r\n\r\nNor did she care for Shatov, who became one of our circle during the\r\nlast years of this period.","Shatov had been a student and had been\r\nexpelled from the university after some disturbance. In his childhood he\r\nhad been a student of Stepan Trofimovitch's and was by birth a serf of\r\nVarvara Petrovna's, the son of a former valet of hers, Pavel Fyodoritch,\r\nand was greatly indebted to her bounty. She disliked him for his pride\r\nand ingratitude and could never forgive him for not having come straight\r\nto her on his expulsion from the university.","On the contrary he had not\r\neven answered the letter she had expressly sent him at the time, and\r\npreferred to be a drudge in the family of a merchant of the new style,\r\nwith whom he went abroad, looking after his children more in the\r\nposition of a nurse than of a tutor. He was very eager to travel at the\r\ntime. The children had a governess too, a lively young Russian lady, who\r\nalso became one of the household on the eve of their departure, and\r\nhad been engaged chiefly because she was so cheap.","Two months later the\r\nmerchant turned her out of the house for \"free thinking.\" Shatov took\r\nhimself off after her and soon afterwards married her in Geneva.\r\nThey lived together about three weeks, and then parted as free people\r\nrecognising no bonds, though, no doubt, also through poverty. He\r\nwandered about Europe alone for a long time afterwards, living God knows\r\nhow; he is said to have blacked boots in the street, and to have been a\r\nporter in some dockyard.","At last, a year before, he had returned to his\r\nnative place among us and settled with an old aunt, whom he buried a\r\nmonth later. His sister Dasha, who had also been brought up by Varvara\r\nPetrovna, was a favourite of hers, and treated with respect and\r\nconsideration in her house. He saw his sister rarely and was not on\r\nintimate terms with her. In our circle he was always sullen, and never\r\ntalkative; but from time to time, when his convictions were touched\r\nupon, he became morbidly irritable and very unrestrained in his\r\nlanguage.","\"One has to tie Shatov up and then argue with him,\" Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nwould sometimes say in joke, but he liked him.\r\n\r\nShatov had radically changed some of his former socialistic convictions\r\nabroad and had rushed to the opposite extreme. He was one of those\r\nidealistic beings common in Russia, who are suddenly struck by some\r\novermastering idea which seems, as it were, to crush them at once, and\r\nsometimes forever.","They are never equal to coping with it, but put\r\npassionate faith in it, and their whole life passes afterwards, as it\r\nwere, in the last agonies under the weight of the stone that has fallen\r\nupon them and half crushed them. In appearance Shatov was in complete\r\nharmony with his convictions: he was short, awkward, had a shock of\r\nflaxen hair, broad shoulders, thick lips, very thick overhanging white\r\neyebrows, a wrinkled forehead, and a hostile, obstinately downcast, as\r\nit were shamefaced, expression in his eyes.","His hair was always in a\r\nwild tangle and stood up in a shock which nothing could smooth. He was\r\nseven- or eight-and-twenty.\r\n\r\n\"I no longer wonder that his wife ran away from him,\" Varvara Petrovna\r\nenunciated on one occasion after gazing intently at him. He tried to be\r\nneat in his dress, in spite of his extreme poverty. He refrained again\r\nfrom appealing to Varvara Petrovna, and struggled along as best he\r\ncould, doing various jobs for tradespeople.","At one time he served in a\r\nshop, at another he was on the point of going as an assistant clerk on a\r\nfreight steamer, but he fell ill just at the time of sailing. It is\r\nhard to imagine what poverty he was capable of enduring without thinking\r\nabout it at all. After his illness Varvara Petrovna sent him a hundred\r\nroubles, anonymously and in secret. He found out the secret, however,\r\nand after some reflection took the money and went to Varvara Petrovna to\r\nthank her.","She received him with warmth, but on this occasion, too,\r\nhe shamefully disappointed her. He only stayed five minutes, staring\r\nblankly at the ground and smiling stupidly in profound silence, and\r\nsuddenly, at the most interesting point, without listening to what\r\nshe was saying, he got up, made an uncouth sideways bow, helpless\r\nwith confusion, caught against the lady's expensive inlaid work-table,\r\nupsetting it on the floor and smashing it to atoms, and walked out\r\nnearly dead with shame.","Liputin blamed him severely afterwards for\r\nhaving accepted the hundred roubles and having even gone to thank\r\nVarvara Petrovna for them, instead of having returned the money with\r\ncontempt, because it had come from his former despotic mistress. He\r\nlived in solitude on the outskirts of the town, and did not like any\r\nof us to go and see him. He used to turn up invariably at Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch's evenings, and borrowed newspapers and books from him.","There was another young man who always came, one Virginsky, a clerk in\r\nthe service here, who had something in common with Shatov, though on\r\nthe surface he seemed his complete opposite in every respect. He was a\r\n\"family man\" too. He was a pathetic and very quiet young man though\r\nhe was thirty; he had considerable education though he was chiefly\r\nself-taught. He was poor, married, and in the service, and supported the\r\naunt and sister of his wife.","His wife and all the ladies of his family\r\nprofessed the very latest convictions, but in rather a crude form.\r\nIt was a case of \"an idea dragged forth into the street,\" as Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch had expressed it upon a former occasion. They got it\r\nall out of books, and at the first hint coming from any of our little\r\nprogressive corners in Petersburg they were prepared to throw anything\r\noverboard, so soon as they were advised to do so.","Madame Virginsky\r\npractised as a midwife in the town. She had lived a long while\r\nin Petersburg as a girl. Virginsky himself was a man of rare\r\nsingle-heartedness, and I have seldom met more honest fervour.\r\n\r\n\"I will never, never, abandon these bright hopes,\" he used to say to me\r\nwith shining eyes. Of these \"bright hopes\" he always spoke quietly, in\r\na blissful half-whisper, as it were secretly.","He was rather tall, but\r\nextremely thin and narrow-shouldered, and had extraordinarily lank hair\r\nof a reddish hue. All Stepan Trofimovitch's condescending gibes at\r\nsome of his opinions he accepted mildly, answered him sometimes very\r\nseriously, and often nonplussed him. Stepan Trofimovitch treated him\r\nvery kindly, and indeed he behaved like a father to all of us. \"You are\r\nall half-hearted chickens,\" he observed to Virginsky in joke.","\"All\r\nwho are like you, though in you, Virginsky, I have not observed that\r\nnarrow-mindedness I found in Petersburg, _chez ces s√©minaristes_. But\r\nyou're a half-hatched chicken all the same. Shatov would give anything\r\nto hatch out, but he's half-hatched too.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I?\" Liputin inquired.\r\n\r\n\"You're simply the golden mean which will get on anywhere in its own\r\nway.\" Liputin was offended.\r\n\r\nThe story was told of Virginsky, and it was unhappily only too true,\r\nthat before his wife had spent a year in lawful wedlock with him she\r\nannounced that he was superseded and that she preferred Lebyadkin.","This\r\nLebyadkin, a stranger to the town, turned out afterwards to be a very\r\ndubious character, and not a retired captain as he represented himself\r\nto be. He could do nothing but twist his moustache, drink, and chatter\r\nthe most inept nonsense that can possibly be imagined. This fellow, who\r\nwas utterly lacking in delicacy, at once settled in his house, glad to\r\nlive at another man's expense, ate and slept there and came, in the end,\r\nto treating the master of the house with condescension.","It was asserted\r\nthat when Virginsky's wife had announced to him that he was superseded\r\nhe said to her:\r\n\r\n\"My dear, hitherto I have only loved you, but now I respect you,\" but I\r\ndoubt whether this renunciation, worthy of ancient Rome, was ever really\r\nuttered. On the contrary they say that he wept violently. A fortnight\r\nafter he was superseded, all of them, in a \"family party,\" went one day\r\nfor a picnic to a wood outside the town to drink tea with their friends.","Virginsky was in a feverishly lively mood and took part in the dances.\r\nBut suddenly, without any preliminary quarrel, he seized the giant\r\nLebyadkin with both hands, by the hair, just as the latter was dancing\r\na can-can solo, pushed him down, and began dragging him along with\r\nshrieks, shouts, and tears. The giant was so panic-stricken that he did\r\nnot attempt to defend himself, and hardly uttered a sound all the time\r\nhe was being dragged along.","But afterwards he resented it with all the\r\nheat of an honourable man. Virginsky spent a whole night on his knees\r\nbegging his wife's forgiveness. But this forgiveness was not granted, as\r\nhe refused to apologise to Lebyadkin; moreover, he was upbraided for the\r\nmeanness of his ideas and his foolishness, the latter charge based on\r\nthe fact that he knelt down in the interview with his wife. The captain\r\nsoon disappeared and did not reappear in our town till quite lately,\r\nwhen he came with his sister, and with entirely different aims; but\r\nof him later.","It was no wonder that the poor young husband sought our\r\nsociety and found comfort in it. But he never spoke of his home-life to\r\nus. On one occasion only, returning with me from Stepan Trofimovitch's,\r\nhe made a remote allusion to his position, but clutching my hand at once\r\nhe cried ardently:\r\n\r\n\"It's of no consequence. It's only a personal incident. It's no\r\nhindrance to the 'cause,' not the slightest!\"\r\n\r\nStray guests visited our circle too; a Jew, called Lyamshin, and a\r\nCaptain Kartusov came.","An old gentleman of inquiring mind used to come\r\nat one time, but he died. Liputin brought an exiled Polish priest called\r\nSlontsevsky, and for a time we received him on principle, but afterwards\r\nwe didn't keep it up.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nAt one time it was reported about the town that our little circle was a\r\nhotbed of nihilism, profligacy, and godlessness, and the rumour gained\r\nmore and more strength. And yet we did nothing but indulge in the most\r\nharmless, agreeable, typically Russian, light-hearted liberal chatter.","\"The higher liberalism\" and the \"higher liberal,\" that is, a liberal\r\nwithout any definite aim, is only possible in Russia.\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch, like every witty man, needed a listener, and,\r\nbesides that, he needed the consciousness that he was fulfilling the\r\nlofty duty of disseminating ideas. And finally he had to have someone\r\nto drink champagne with, and over the wine to exchange light-hearted\r\nviews of a certain sort, about Russia and the \"Russian spirit,\" about\r\nGod in general, and the \"Russian God\" in particular, to repeat for the\r\nhundredth time the same Russian scandalous stories that every one knew\r\nand every one repeated.","We had no distaste for the gossip of the town\r\nwhich often, indeed, led us to the most severe and loftily moral\r\nverdicts. We fell into generalising about humanity, made stern\r\nreflections on the future of Europe and mankind in general,\r\nauthoritatively predicted that after C√¶sarism France would at once sink\r\ninto the position of a second-rate power, and were firmly convinced that\r\nthis might terribly easily and quickly come to pass.","We had long ago\r\npredicted that the Pope would play the part of a simple archbishop in\r\na united Italy, and were firmly convinced that this thousand-year-old\r\nquestion had, in our age of humanitarianism, industry, and railways,\r\nbecome a trifling matter. But, of course, \"Russian higher liberalism\"\r\ncould not look at the question in any other way. Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nsometimes talked of art, and very well, though rather abstractly.","He\r\nsometimes spoke of the friends of his youth--all names noteworthy in\r\nthe history of Russian progress. He talked of them with emotion and\r\nreverence, though sometimes with envy. If we were very much bored, the\r\nJew, Lyamshin (a little post-office clerk), a wonderful performer on\r\nthe piano, sat down to play, and in the intervals would imitate a pig,\r\na thunderstorm, a confinement with the first cry of the baby, and so on,\r\nand so on; it was only for this that he was invited, indeed.","If we had\r\ndrunk a great deal--and that did happen sometimes, though not often--we\r\nflew into raptures, and even on one occasion sang the \"Marseillaise\" in\r\nchorus to the accompaniment of Lyamshin, though I don't know how it\r\nwent off. The great day, the nineteenth of February, we welcomed\r\nenthusiastically, and for a long time beforehand drank toasts in its\r\nhonour. But that was long ago, before the advent of Shatov or Virginsky,\r\nwhen Stepan Trofimovitch was still living in the same house with Varvara\r\nPetrovna.","For some time before the great day Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nfell into the habit of muttering to himself well-known, though rather\r\nfar-fetched, lines which must have been written by some liberal\r\nlandowner of the past:\r\n\r\n_\"The peasant with his axe is coming,_\r\n_Something terrible will happen.\"_\r\n\r\nSomething of that sort, I don't remember the exact words. Varvara\r\nPetrovna overheard him on one occasion, and crying, \"Nonsense,\r\nnonsense!\" she went out of the room in a rage.","Liputin, who happened to\r\nbe present, observed malignantly to Stepan Trofimovitch:\r\n\r\n\"It'll be a pity if their former serfs really do some mischief to\r\n_messieurs les_ landowners to celebrate the occasion,\" and he drew his\r\nforefinger round his throat.\r\n\r\n\"_Cher ami,_\" Stepan Trofimovitch observed, \"believe me that--this (he\r\nrepeated the gesture) will never be of any use to our landowners nor to\r\nany of us in general.","We shall never be capable of organising anything\r\neven without our heads, though our heads hinder our understanding more\r\nthan anything.\"\r\n\r\nI may observe that many people among us anticipated that something\r\nextraordinary, such as Liputin predicted, would take place on the day\r\nof the emancipation, and those who held this view were the so-called\r\n\"authorities\" on the peasantry and the government.","I believe Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch shared this idea, so much so that almost on the eve of the\r\ngreat day he began asking Varvara Petrovna's leave to go abroad; in fact\r\nhe began to be uneasy. But the great day passed, and some time\r\npassed after it, and the condescending smile reappeared on Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch's lips. In our presence he delivered himself of some\r\nnoteworthy thoughts on the character of the Russian in general, and the\r\nRussian peasant in particular.","\"Like hasty people we have been in too great a hurry with our peasants,\"\r\nhe said in conclusion of a series of remarkable utterances. \"We have\r\nmade them the fashion, and a whole section of writers have for several\r\nyears treated them as though they were newly discovered curiosities. We\r\nhave put laurel-wreaths on lousy heads. The Russian village has given us\r\nonly 'Kamarinsky' in a thousand years.","A remarkable Russian poet who was\r\nalso something of a wit, seeing the great Rachel on the stage for the\r\nfirst time cried in ecstasy, 'I wouldn't exchange Rachel for a peasant!'\r\nI am prepared to go further. I would give all the peasants in Russia\r\nfor one Rachel. It's high time to look things in the face more\r\nsoberly, and not to mix up our national rustic pitch with _bouquet de\r\nl'Imp√©ratrice._\"\r\n\r\nLiputin agreed at once, but remarked that one had to perjure oneself and\r\npraise the peasant all the same for the sake of being progressive, that\r\neven ladies in good society shed tears reading \"Poor Anton,\" and that\r\nsome of them even wrote from Paris to their bailiffs that they were,\r\nhenceforward, to treat the peasants as humanely as possible.","It happened, and as ill-luck would have it just after the rumours of the\r\nAnton Petrov affair had reached us, that there was some disturbance\r\nin our province too, only about ten miles from Skvoreshniki, so that a\r\ndetachment of soldiers was sent down in a hurry.\r\n\r\nThis time Stepan Trofimovitch was so much upset that he even frightened\r\nus. He cried out at the club that more troops were needed, that they\r\nought to be telegraphed for from another province; he rushed off to the\r\ngovernor to protest that he had no hand in it, begged him not to allow\r\nhis name on account of old associations to be brought into it, and\r\noffered to write about his protest to the proper quarter in Petersburg.","Fortunately it all passed over quickly and ended in nothing, but I was\r\nsurprised at Stepan Trofimovitch at the time.\r\n\r\nThree years later, as every one knows, people were beginning to talk\r\nof nationalism, and \"public opinion\" first came upon the scene. Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch laughed a great deal.\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" he instructed us, \"if our nationalism has 'dawned' as\r\nthey keep repeating in the papers--it's still at school, at some German\r\n'Peterschule,' sitting over a German book and repeating its everlasting\r\nGerman lesson, and its German teacher will make it go down on its knees\r\nwhen he thinks fit.","I think highly of the German teacher. But nothing\r\nhas happened and nothing of the kind has dawned and everything is going\r\non in the old way, that is, as ordained by God. To my thinking that\r\nshould be enough for Russia, _pour notre Sainte Russie_. Besides, all this\r\nSlavism and nationalism is too old to be new. Nationalism, if you like,\r\nhas never existed among us except as a distraction for gentlemen's\r\nclubs, and Moscow ones at that.","I'm not talking of the days of Igor, of\r\ncourse. And besides it all comes of idleness. Everything in Russia comes\r\nof idleness, everything good and fine even. It all springs from the\r\ncharming, cultured, whimsical idleness of our gentry! I'm ready to\r\nrepeat it for thirty thousand years. We don't know how to live by our\r\nown labour. And as for the fuss they're making now about the 'dawn'\r\nof some sort of public opinion, has it so suddenly dropped from heaven\r\nwithout any warning? How is it they don't understand that before we\r\ncan have an opinion of our own we must have work, our own work, our own\r\ninitiative in things, our own experience.","Nothing is to be gained for\r\nnothing. If we work we shall have an opinion of our own. But as we\r\nnever shall work, our opinions will be formed for us by those who have\r\nhitherto done the work instead of us, that is, as always, Europe, the\r\neverlasting Germans--our teachers for the last two centuries. Moreover,\r\nRussia is too big a tangle for us to unravel alone without the Germans,\r\nand without hard work.","For the last twenty years I've been sounding the\r\nalarm, and the summons to work. I've given up my life to that appeal,\r\nand, in my folly I put faith in it. Now I have lost faith in it, but I\r\nsound the alarm still, and shall sound it to the tomb. I will pull at\r\nthe bell-ropes until they toll for my own requiem!\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! We could do nothing but assent. We applauded our teacher and with\r\nwhat warmth, indeed! And, after all, my friends, don't we still hear\r\nto-day, every hour, at every step, the same \"charming,\" \"clever,\"\r\n\"liberal,\" old Russian nonsense? Our teacher believed in God.","\"I can't understand why they make me out an infidel here,\" he used to\r\nsay sometimes. \"I believe in God, _mais distinguons_, I believe in Him as\r\na Being who is conscious of Himself in me only. I cannot believe as my\r\nNastasya (the servant) or like some country gentleman who believes 'to\r\nbe on the safe side,' or like our dear Shatov--but no, Shatov doesn't\r\ncome into it. Shatov believes 'on principle,' like a Moscow Slavophil.","As for Christianity, for all my genuine respect for it, I'm not a\r\nChristian. I am more of an antique pagan, like the great Goethe, or\r\nlike an ancient Greek. The very fact that Christianity has failed to\r\nunderstand woman is enough, as George Sand has so splendidly shown in\r\none of her great novels. As for the bowings, fasting and all the rest\r\nof it, I don't understand what they have to do with me.","However busy the\r\ninformers may be here, I don't care to become a Jesuit. In the year 1847\r\nByelinsky, who was abroad, sent his famous letter to Gogol, and warmly\r\nreproached him for believing in some sort of God. _Entre nous soit dit,_ I\r\ncan imagine nothing more comic than the moment when Gogol (the Gogol of\r\nthat period!) read that phrase, and... the whole letter! But dismissing\r\nthe humorous aspect, and, as I am fundamentally in agreement, I point to\r\nthem and say--these were men! They knew how to love their people, they\r\nknew how to suffer for them, they knew how to sacrifice everything for\r\nthem, yet they knew how to differ from them when they ought, and did not\r\nfilch certain ideas from them.","Could Byelinsky have sought salvation\r\nin Lenten oil, or peas with radish!...\" But at this point Shatov\r\ninterposed.\r\n\r\n\"Those men of yours never loved the people, they didn't suffer for them,\r\nand didn't sacrifice anything for them, though they may have amused\r\nthemselves by imagining it!\" he growled sullenly, looking down, and\r\nmoving impatiently in his chair.\r\n\r\n\"They didn't love the people!\" yelled Stepan Trofimovitch.","\"Oh, how they\r\nloved Russia!\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither Russia nor the people!\" Shatov yelled too, with flashing eyes.\r\n\"You can't love what you don't know and they had no conception of the\r\nRussian people. All of them peered at the Russian people through their\r\nfingers, and you do too; Byelinsky especially: from that very letter to\r\nGogol one can see it. Byelinsky, like the Inquisitive Man in Krylov's\r\nfable, did not notice the elephant in the museum of curiosities, but\r\nconcentrated his whole attention on the French Socialist beetles; he did\r\nnot get beyond them.","And yet perhaps he was cleverer than any of you.\r\nYou've not only overlooked the people, you've taken up an attitude of\r\ndisgusting contempt for them, if only because you could not imagine any\r\nbut the French people, the Parisians indeed, and were ashamed that the\r\nRussians were not like them. That's the naked truth. And he who has\r\nno people has no God. You may be sure that all who cease to understand\r\ntheir own people and lose their connection with them at once lose to\r\nthe same extent the faith of their fathers, and become atheistic or\r\nindifferent.","I'm speaking the truth! This is a fact which will be\r\nrealised. That's why all of you and all of us now are either beastly\r\natheists or careless, dissolute imbeciles, and nothing more. And you\r\ntoo, Stepan Trofimovitch, I don't make an exception of you at all! In\r\nfact, it is on your account I am speaking, let me tell you that!\"\r\n\r\nAs a rule, after uttering such monologues (which happened to him pretty\r\nfrequently) Shatov snatched up his cap and rushed to the door, in the\r\nfull conviction that everything was now over, and that he had cut short\r\nall friendly relations with Stepan Trofimovitch forever.","But the latter\r\nalways succeeded in stopping him in time.\r\n\r\n\"Hadn't we better make it up, Shatov, after all these endearments,\" he\r\nwould say, benignly holding out his hand to him from his arm-chair.\r\n\r\nShatov, clumsy and bashful, disliked sentimentality. Externally he was\r\nrough, but inwardly, I believe, he had great delicacy. Although he often\r\nwent too far, he was the first to suffer for it. Muttering something\r\nbetween his teeth in response to Stepan Trofimovitch's appeal, and\r\nshuffling with his feet like a bear, he gave a sudden and unexpected\r\nsmile, put down his cap, and sat down in the same chair as before, with\r\nhis eyes stubbornly fixed on the ground.","Wine was, of course, brought\r\nin, and Stepan Trofimovitch proposed some suitable toast, for instance\r\nthe memory of some leading man of the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. PRINCE HARRY. MATCHMAKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHERE WAS ANOTHER being in the world to whom Varvara Petrovna was as\r\nmuch attached as she was to Stepan Trofimovitch, her only son, Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch Stavrogin. It was to undertake his education that Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch had been engaged.","The boy was at that time eight years old,\r\nand his frivolous father, General Stavrogin, was already living apart\r\nfrom Varvara Petrovna, so that the child grew up entirely in his\r\nmother's care. To do Stepan Trofimovitch justice, he knew how to win his\r\npupil's heart. The whole secret of this lay in the fact that he was a\r\nchild himself. I was not there in those days, and he continually felt\r\nthe want of a real friend.","He did not hesitate to make a friend of this\r\nlittle creature as soon as he had grown a little older. It somehow came\r\nto pass quite naturally that there seemed to be no discrepancy of age\r\nbetween them. More than once he awaked his ten- or eleven-year-old\r\nfriend at night, simply to pour out his wounded feelings and weep before\r\nhim, or to tell him some family secret, without realising that this was\r\nan outrageous proceeding.","They threw themselves into each other's arms\r\nand wept. The boy knew that his mother loved him very much, but I doubt\r\nwhether he cared much for her. She talked little to him and did not\r\noften interfere with him, but he was always morbidly conscious of her\r\nintent, searching eyes fixed upon him. Yet the mother confided his whole\r\ninstruction and moral education to Stepan Trofimovitch. At that time her\r\nfaith in him was unshaken.","One can't help believing that the tutor had\r\nrather a bad influence on his pupil's nerves. When at sixteen he was\r\ntaken to a lyceum he was fragile-looking and pale, strangely quiet and\r\ndreamy. (Later on he was distinguished by great physical strength.)\r\nOne must assume too that the friends went on weeping at night, throwing\r\nthemselves in each other's arms, though their tears were not always due\r\nto domestic difficulties.","Stepan Trofimovitch succeeded in reaching\r\nthe deepest chords in his pupil's heart, and had aroused in him a vague\r\nsensation of that eternal, sacred yearning which some elect souls can\r\nnever give up for cheap gratification when once they have tasted and\r\nknown it. (There are some connoisseurs who prize this yearning more than\r\nthe most complete satisfaction of it, if such were possible.) But in any\r\ncase it was just as well that the pupil and the preceptor were, though\r\nnone too soon, parted.","For the first two years the lad used to come home from the lyceum\r\nfor the holidays. While Varvara Petrovna and Stepan Trofimovitch were\r\nstaying in Petersburg he was sometimes present at the literary evenings\r\nat his mother's, he listened and looked on. He spoke little, and was\r\nquiet and shy as before. His manner to Stepan Trofimovitch was as\r\naffectionately attentive as ever, but there was a shade of reserve in\r\nit.","He unmistakably avoided distressing, lofty subjects or reminiscences\r\nof the past. By his mother's wish he entered the army on completing\r\nthe school course, and soon received a commission in one of the most\r\nbrilliant regiments of the Horse Guards. He did not come to show himself\r\nto his mother in his uniform, and his letters from Petersburg began to\r\nbe infrequent. Varvara Petrovna sent him money without stint, though\r\nafter the emancipation the revenue from her estate was so diminished\r\nthat at first her income was less than half what it had been before.","She\r\nhad, however, a considerable sum laid by through years of economy.\r\nShe took great interest in her son's success in the highest Petersburg\r\nsociety. Where she had failed, the wealthy young officer with\r\nexpectations succeeded. He renewed acquaintances which she had hardly\r\ndared to dream of, and was welcomed everywhere with pleasure. But very\r\nsoon rather strange rumours reached Varvara Petrovna.","The young man\r\nhad suddenly taken to riotous living with a sort of frenzy. Not that he\r\ngambled or drank too much; there was only talk of savage recklessness,\r\nof running over people in the street with his horses, of brutal conduct\r\nto a lady of good society with whom he had a liaison and whom he\r\nafterwards publicly insulted. There was a callous nastiness about this\r\naffair. It was added, too, that he had developed into a regular bully,\r\ninsulting people for the mere pleasure of insulting them.","Varvara\r\nPetrovna was greatly agitated and distressed. Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nassured her that this was only the first riotous effervescence of a too\r\nrichly endowed nature, that the storm would subside and that this was\r\nonly like the youth of Prince Harry, who caroused with Falstaff, Poins,\r\nand Mrs. Quickly, as described by Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nThis time Varvara Petrovna did not cry out, \"Nonsense, nonsense!\" as she\r\nwas very apt to do in later years in response to Stepan Trofimovitch.","On\r\nthe contrary she listened very eagerly, asked him to explain this theory\r\nmore exactly, took up Shakespeare herself and with great attention read\r\nthe immortal chronicle. But it did not comfort her, and indeed she did\r\nnot find the resemblance very striking. With feverish impatience she\r\nawaited answers to some of her letters. She had not long to wait for\r\nthem. The fatal news soon reached her that \"Prince Harry\" had been\r\ninvolved in two duels almost at once, was entirely to blame for both of\r\nthem, had killed one of his adversaries on the spot and had maimed the\r\nother and was awaiting his trial in consequence.","The case ended in his\r\nbeing degraded to the ranks, deprived of the rights of a nobleman, and\r\ntransferred to an infantry line regiment, and he only escaped worse\r\npunishment by special favour.\r\n\r\nIn 1863 he somehow succeeded in distinguishing himself; he received a\r\ncross, was promoted to be a non-commissioned officer, and rose\r\nrapidly to the rank of an officer. During this period Varvara Petrovna\r\ndespatched perhaps hundreds of letters to the capital, full of prayers\r\nand supplications.","She even stooped to some humiliation in this\r\nextremity. After his promotion the young man suddenly resigned his\r\ncommission, but he did not come back to Skvoreshniki again, and gave up\r\nwriting to his mother altogether. They learned by roundabout means that\r\nhe was back in Petersburg, but that he was not to be met in the same\r\nsociety as before; he seemed to be in hiding. They found out that he was\r\nliving in strange company, associating with the dregs of the population\r\nof Petersburg, with slip-shod government clerks, discharged military\r\nmen, beggars of the higher class, and drunkards of all sorts--that he\r\nvisited their filthy families, spent days and nights in dark slums and\r\nall sorts of low haunts, that he had sunk very low, that he was in rags,\r\nand that apparently he liked it.","He did not ask his mother for money,\r\nhe had his own little estate--once the property of his father, General\r\nStavrogin, which yielded at least some revenue, and which, it was\r\nreported, he had let to a German from Saxony. At last his mother\r\nbesought him to come to her, and \"Prince Harry\" made his appearance\r\nin our town. I had never set eyes on him before, but now I got a very\r\ndistinct impression of him.","He was a very handsome young man of\r\nfive-and-twenty, and I must own I was impressed by him. I had expected\r\nto see a dirty ragamuffin, sodden with drink and debauchery. He was on\r\nthe contrary, the most elegant gentleman I had ever met, extremely well\r\ndressed, with an air and manner only to be found in a man accustomed to\r\nculture and refinement. I was not the only person surprised. It was a\r\nsurprise to all the townspeople to whom, of course, young Stavrogin's\r\nwhole biography was well known in its minutest details, though one could\r\nnot imagine how they had got hold of them, and, what was still more\r\nsurprising, half of their stories about him turned out to be true.","All our ladies were wild over the new visitor. They were sharply divided\r\ninto two parties, one of which adored him while the other half regarded\r\nhim with a hatred that was almost blood-thirsty: but both were crazy\r\nabout him. Some of them were particularly fascinated by the idea that he\r\nhad perhaps a fateful secret hidden in his soul; others were positively\r\ndelighted at the fact that he was a murderer.","It appeared too that\r\nhe had had a very good education and was indeed a man of considerable\r\nculture. No great acquirements were needed, of course, to astonish us.\r\nBut he could judge also of very interesting everyday affairs, and, what\r\nwas of the utmost value, he judged of them with remarkable good sense. I\r\nmust mention as a peculiar fact that almost from the first day we all of\r\nus thought him a very sensible fellow.","He was not very talkative, he was\r\nelegant without exaggeration, surprisingly modest, and at the same time\r\nbold and self-reliant, as none of us were. Our dandies gazed at him with\r\nenvy, and were completely eclipsed by him. His face, too, impressed me.\r\nHis hair was of a peculiarly intense black, his light-coloured eyes were\r\npeculiarly light and calm, his complexion was peculiarly soft and white,\r\nthe red in his cheeks was too bright and clear, his teeth were like\r\npearls, and his lips like coral--one would have thought that he must\r\nbe a paragon of beauty, yet at the same time there seemed something\r\nrepellent about him.","It was said that his face suggested a mask; so much\r\nwas said though, among other things they talked of his extraordinary\r\nphysical strength. He was rather tall. Varvara Petrovna looked at him\r\nwith pride, yet with continual uneasiness. He spent about six months\r\namong us--listless, quiet, rather morose. He made his appearance in\r\nsociety, and with unfailing propriety performed all the duties demanded\r\nby our provincial etiquette.","He was related, on his father's side, to\r\nthe governor, and was received by the latter as a near kinsman. But a\r\nfew months passed and the wild beast showed his claws.\r\n\r\nI may observe by the way, in parenthesis, that Ivan Ossipovitch, our\r\ndear mild governor, was rather like an old woman, though he was of good\r\nfamily and highly connected--which explains the fact that he remained so\r\nlong among us, though he steadily avoided all the duties of his office.","From his munificence and hospitality he ought rather to have been a\r\nmarshal of nobility of the good old days than a governor in such busy\r\ntimes as ours. It was always said in the town that it was not he, but\r\nVarvara Petrovna who governed the province. Of course this was said\r\nsarcastically; however, it was certainly a falsehood. And, indeed, much\r\nwit was wasted on the subject among us. On the contrary, in later years,\r\nVarvara Petrovna purposely and consciously withdrew from anything like\r\na position of authority, and, in spite of the extraordinary respect\r\nin which she was held by the whole province, voluntarily confined her\r\ninfluence within strict limits set up by herself.","Instead of these\r\nhigher responsibilities she suddenly took up the management of her\r\nestate, and, within two or three years, raised the revenue from it\r\nalmost to what it had yielded in the past. Giving up her former romantic\r\nimpulses (trips to Petersburg, plans for founding a magazine, and so\r\non) she began to be careful and to save money. She kept even Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch at a distance, allowing him to take lodgings in another\r\nhouse (a change for which he had long been worrying her under various\r\npretexts).","Little by little Stepan Trofimovitch began to call her a\r\nprosaic woman, or more jestingly, \"My prosaic friend.\" I need hardly say\r\nhe only ventured on such jests in an extremely respectful form, and on\r\nrare, and carefully chosen, occasions.\r\n\r\nAll of us in her intimate circle felt--Stepan Trofimovitch more acutely\r\nthan any of us--that her son had come to her almost, as it were, as a\r\nnew hope, and even as a sort of new aspiration.","Her passion for her son\r\ndated from the time of his successes in Petersburg society, and grew\r\nmore intense from the moment that he was degraded in the army. Yet she\r\nwas evidently afraid of him, and seemed like a slave in his presence.\r\nIt could be seen that she was afraid of something vague and mysterious\r\nwhich she could not have put into words, and she often stole searching\r\nglances at \"Nicolas,\" scrutinising him reflectively.",".. and behold--the\r\nwild beast suddenly showed his claws.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSuddenly, apropos of nothing, our prince was guilty of incredible\r\noutrages upon various persons and, what was most striking these outrages\r\nwere utterly unheard of, quite inconceivable, unlike anything commonly\r\ndone, utterly silly and mischievous, quite unprovoked and objectless.\r\nOne of the most respected of our club members, on our committee of\r\nmanagement, Pyotr Pavlovitch Gaganov, an elderly man of high rank in the\r\nservice, had formed the innocent habit of declaring vehemently on all\r\nsorts of occasions: \"No, you can't lead me by the nose!\" Well, there\r\nis no harm in that.","But one day at the club, when he brought out this\r\nphrase in connection with some heated discussion in the midst of a\r\nlittle group of members (all persons of some consequence) Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch, who was standing on one side, alone and unnoticed,\r\nsuddenly went up to Pyotr Pavlovitch, took him unexpectedly and firmly\r\nwith two fingers by the nose, and succeeded in leading him two or three\r\nsteps across the room.","He could have had no grudge against Mr. Gaganov.\r\nIt might be thought to be a mere schoolboy prank, though, of course, a\r\nmost unpardonable one. Yet, describing it afterwards, people said that\r\nhe looked almost dreamy at the very instant of the operation, \"as though\r\nhe had gone out of his mind,\" but that was recalled and reflected upon\r\nlong afterwards. In the excitement of the moment all they recalled was\r\nthe minute after, when he certainly saw it all as it really was, and far\r\nfrom being confused smiled gaily and maliciously \"without the slightest\r\nregret.","\" There was a terrific outcry; he was surrounded. Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch kept turning round, looking about him, answering nobody,\r\nand glancing curiously at the persons exclaiming around him. At last he\r\nseemed suddenly, as it were, to sink into thought again--so at least it\r\nwas reported--frowned, went firmly up to the affronted Pyotr Pavlovitch,\r\nand with evident vexation said in a rapid mutter:\r\n\r\n\"You must forgive me, of course.",".. I really don't know what suddenly\r\ncame over me... it's silly.\"\r\n\r\nThe carelessness of his apology was almost equivalent to a fresh insult.\r\nThe outcry was greater than ever. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch shrugged his\r\nshoulders and went away. All this was very stupid, to say nothing of its\r\ngross indecency--\r\n\r\nA calculated and premeditated indecency as it seemed at first sight--and\r\ntherefore a premeditated and utterly brutal insult to our whole society.","So it was taken to be by every one. We began by promptly and unanimously\r\nstriking young Stavrogin's name off the list of club members. Then it\r\nwas decided to send an appeal in the name of the whole club to the\r\ngovernor, begging him at once (without waiting for the case to be\r\nformally tried in court) to use \"the administrative power entrusted to\r\nhim\" to restrain this dangerous ruffian, \"this duelling bully from the\r\ncapital, and so protect the tranquillity of all the gentry of our town\r\nfrom injurious encroachments.","\" It was added with angry resentment that\r\n\"a law might be found to control even Mr. Stavrogin.\" This phrase was\r\nprepared by way of a thrust at the governor on account of Varvara\r\nPetrovna. They elaborated it with relish. As ill luck would have it,\r\nthe governor was not in the town at the time. He had gone to a little\r\ndistance to stand godfather to the child of a very charming lady,\r\nrecently left a widow in an interesting condition.","But it was known that\r\nhe would soon be back. In the meanwhile they got up a regular ovation\r\nfor the respected and insulted gentleman; people embraced and kissed\r\nhim; the whole town called upon him. It was even proposed to give a\r\nsubscription dinner in his honour, and they only gave up the idea at\r\nhis earnest request--reflecting possibly at last that the man had,\r\nafter all, been pulled by the nose and that that was really nothing\r\nto congratulate him upon.","Yet, how had it happened? How could it have\r\nhappened? It is remarkable that no one in the whole town put down this\r\nsavage act to madness. They must have been predisposed to expect such\r\nactions from Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, even when he was sane. For my part\r\nI don't know to this day how to explain it, in spite of the event that\r\nquickly followed and apparently explained everything, and conciliated\r\nevery one.","I will add also that, four years later, in reply to a\r\ndiscreet question from me about the incident at the club, Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch answered, frowning: \"I wasn't quite well at the time.\"\r\nBut there is no need to anticipate events.\r\n\r\nThe general outburst of hatred with which every one fell upon the\r\n\"ruffian and duelling bully from the capital\" also struck me as curious.\r\nThey insisted on seeing an insolent design and deliberate intention to\r\ninsult our whole society at once.","The truth was no one liked the fellow,\r\nbut, on the contrary, he had set every one against him--and one wonders\r\nhow. Up to the last incident he had never quarrelled with anyone, nor\r\ninsulted anyone, but was as courteous as a gentleman in a fashion-plate,\r\nif only the latter were able to speak. I imagine that he was hated for\r\nhis pride. Even our ladies, who had begun by adoring him, railed against\r\nhim now, more loudly than the men.","Varvara Petrovna was dreadfully\r\noverwhelmed. She confessed afterwards to Stepan Trofimovitch that she\r\nhad had a foreboding of all this long before, that every day for the\r\nlast six months she had been expecting \"just something of that sort,\"\r\na remarkable admission on the part of his own mother. \"It's begun!\" she\r\nthought to herself with a shudder. The morning after the incident at the\r\nclub she cautiously but firmly approached the subject with her son, but\r\nthe poor woman was trembling all over in spite of her firmness.","She had\r\nnot slept all night and even went out early to Stepan Trofimovitch's\r\nlodgings to ask his advice, and shed tears there, a thing which she had\r\nnever been known to do before anyone. She longed for \"Nicolas\" to say\r\nsomething to her, to deign to give some explanation. Nikolay, who was\r\nalways so polite and respectful to his mother, listened to her for some\r\ntime scowling, but very seriously.","He suddenly got up without saying\r\na word, kissed her hand and went away. That very evening, as though by\r\ndesign, he perpetrated another scandal. It was of a more harmless and\r\nordinary character than the first. Yet, owing to the state of the public\r\nmind, it increased the outcry in the town.\r\n\r\nOur friend Liputin turned up and called on Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch\r\nimmediately after the latter's interview with his mother, and earnestly\r\nbegged for the honour of his company at a little party he was giving for\r\nhis wife's birthday that evening.","Varvara Petrovna had long watched with\r\na pang at her heart her son's taste for such low company, but she had\r\nnot dared to speak of it to him. He had made several acquaintances\r\nbesides Liputin in the third rank of our society, and even in lower\r\ndepths--he had a propensity for making such friends. He had never been\r\nin Liputin's house before, though he had met the man himself. He guessed\r\nthat Liputin's invitation now was the consequence of the previous day's\r\nscandal, and that as a local liberal he was delighted at the scandal,\r\ngenuinely believing that that was the proper way to treat stewards at\r\nthe club, and that it was very well done.","Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch smiled\r\nand promised to come.\r\n\r\nA great number of guests had assembled. The company was not very\r\npresentable, but very sprightly. Liputin, vain and envious, only\r\nentertained visitors twice a year, but on those occasions he did\r\nit without stint. The most honoured of the invited guests, Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch, was prevented by illness from being present. Tea was\r\nhanded, and there were refreshments and vodka in plenty.","Cards were\r\nplayed at three tables, and while waiting for supper the young people\r\ngot up a dance. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch led out Madame Liputin--a very\r\npretty little woman who was dreadfully shy of him--took two turns round\r\nthe room with her, sat down beside her, drew her into conversation and\r\nmade her laugh. Noticing at last how pretty she was when she laughed, he\r\nsuddenly, before all the company, seized her round the waist and\r\nkissed her on the lips two or three times with great relish.","The poor\r\nfrightened lady fainted. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch took his hat and went\r\nup to the husband, who stood petrified in the middle of the general\r\nexcitement. Looking at him he, too, became confused and muttering\r\nhurriedly \"Don't be angry,\" went away. Liputin ran after him in the\r\nentry, gave him his fur-coat with his own hands, and saw him down the\r\nstairs, bowing. But next day a rather amusing sequel followed this\r\ncomparatively harmless prank--a sequel from which Liputin gained some\r\ncredit, and of which he took the fullest possible advantage.","At ten o'clock in the morning Liputin's servant Agafya, an\r\neasy-mannered, lively, rosy-cheeked peasant woman of thirty, made\r\nher appearance at Stavrogin's house, with a message for Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch. She insisted on seeing \"his honour himself.\" He had a\r\nvery bad headache, but he went out. Varvara Petrovna succeeded in being\r\npresent when the message was given.\r\n\r\n\"Sergay Vassilyevitch\" (Liputin's name), Agafya rattled off briskly,\r\n\"bade me first of all give you his respectful greetings and ask after\r\nyour health, what sort of night your honour spent after yesterday's\r\ndoings, and how your honour feels now after yesterday's doings?\"\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch smiled.","\"Give him my greetings and thank him, and tell your master from me,\r\nAgafya, that he's the most sensible man in the town.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he told me to answer that,\" Agafya caught him up still more\r\nbriskly, \"that he knows that without your telling him, and wishes you\r\nthe same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really! But how could he tell what I should say to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't say in what way he could tell, but when I had set off and had\r\ngone right down the street, I heard something, and there he was, running\r\nafter me without his cap.","'I say, Agafya, if by any chance he says to\r\nyou, \"Tell your master that he has more sense than all the town,\" you\r\ntell him at once, don't forget, \"The master himself knows that very\r\nwell, and wishes you the same.\"'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAt last the interview with the governor took place too. Our dear, mild,\r\nIvan Ossipovitch had only just returned and only just had time to hear\r\nthe angry complaint from the club.","There was no doubt that something\r\nmust be done, but he was troubled. The hospitable old man seemed also\r\nrather afraid of his young kinsman. He made up his mind, however, to\r\ninduce him to apologise to the club and to his victim in satisfactory\r\nform, and, if required, by letter, and then to persuade him to leave us\r\nfor a time, travelling, for instance, to improve his mind, in Italy, or\r\nin fact anywhere abroad.","In the waiting-room in which on this occasion\r\nhe received Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch (who had been at other times\r\nprivileged as a relation to wander all over the house unchecked),\r\nAlyosha Telyatnikov, a clerk of refined manners, who was also a member\r\nof the governor's household, was sitting in a corner opening envelopes\r\nat a table, and in the next room, at the window nearest to the door, a\r\nstout and sturdy colonel, a former friend and colleague of the governor,\r\nwas sitting alone reading the Golos, paying no attention, of course,\r\nto what was taking place in the waiting-room; in fact, he had his back\r\nturned.","Ivan Ossipovitch approached the subject in a roundabout way,\r\nalmost in a whisper, but kept getting a little muddled. Nikolay looked\r\nanything but cordial, not at all as a relation should. He was pale and\r\nsat looking down and continually moving his eyebrows as though trying to\r\ncontrol acute pain.\r\n\r\n\"You have a kind heart and a generous one, Nicolas,\" the old man put in\r\namong other things, \"you're a man of great culture, you've grown up in\r\nthe highest circles, and here too your behaviour has hitherto been a\r\nmodel, which has been a great consolation to your mother, who is so\r\nprecious to all of us.","... And now again everything has appeared in such\r\nan unaccountable light, so detrimental to all! I speak as a friend of\r\nyour family, as an old man who loves you sincerely and a relation, at\r\nwhose words you cannot take offence.... Tell me, what drives you to such\r\nreckless proceedings so contrary to all accepted rules and habits? What\r\ncan be the meaning of such acts which seem almost like outbreaks of\r\ndelirium?\"\r\n\r\nNikolay listened with vexation and impatience.","All at once there was a\r\ngleam of something sly and mocking in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what drives me to it,\" he said sullenly, and looking\r\nround him he bent down to Ivan Ossipovitch's ear. The refined Alyosha\r\nTelyatnikov moved three steps farther away towards the window, and the\r\ncolonel coughed over the Golos. Poor Ivan Ossipovitch hurriedly and\r\ntrustfully inclined his ear; he was exceedingly curious.","And then\r\nsomething utterly incredible, though on the other side only too\r\nunmistakable, took place. The old man suddenly felt that, instead of\r\ntelling him some interesting secret, Nikolay had seized the upper\r\npart of his ear between his teeth and was nipping it rather hard. He\r\nshuddered, and breath failed him.\r\n\r\n\"Nicolas, this is beyond a joke!\" he moaned mechanically in a voice not\r\nhis own.","Alyosha and the colonel had not yet grasped the situation, besides they\r\ncouldn't see, and fancied up to the end that the two were whispering\r\ntogether; and yet the old man's desperate face alarmed them. They looked\r\nat one another with wide-open eyes, not knowing whether to rush to his\r\nassistance as agreed or to wait. Nikolay noticed this perhaps, and bit\r\nthe harder.\r\n\r\n\"Nicolas! Nicolas!\" his victim moaned again, \"come.",".. you've had your\r\njoke, that's enough!\"\r\n\r\nIn another moment the poor governor would certainly have died of terror;\r\nbut the monster had mercy on him, and let go his ear. The old man's\r\ndeadly terror lasted for a full minute, and it was followed by a sort of\r\nfit. Within half an hour Nikolay was arrested and removed for the time\r\nto the guard-room, where he was confined in a special cell, with a\r\nspecial sentinel at the door.","This decision was a harsh one, but\r\nour mild governor was so angry that he was prepared to take the\r\nresponsibility even if he had to face Varvara Petrovna. To the general\r\namazement, when this lady arrived at the governor's in haste and in\r\nnervous irritation to discuss the matter with him at once, she was\r\nrefused admittance, whereupon, without getting out of the carriage, she\r\nreturned home, unable to believe her senses.","And at last everything was explained! At two o'clock in the morning\r\nthe prisoner, who had till then been calm and had even slept, suddenly\r\nbecame noisy, began furiously beating on the door with his fists,--with\r\nunnatural strength wrenched the iron grating off the door, broke the\r\nwindow, and cut his hands all over. When the officer on duty ran with\r\na detachment of men and the keys and ordered the cell to be opened\r\nthat they might rush in and bind the maniac, it appeared that he was\r\nsuffering from acute brain fever.","He was taken home to his mother.\r\n\r\nEverything was explained at once. All our three doctors gave it as their\r\nopinion that the patient might well have been in a delirious state for\r\nthree days before, and that though he might have apparently been in\r\npossession of full consciousness and cunning, yet he might have been\r\ndeprived of common sense and will, which was indeed borne out by the\r\nfacts. So it turned out that Liputin had guessed the truth sooner than\r\nany one.","Ivan Ossipovitch, who was a man of delicacy and feeling,\r\nwas completely abashed. But what was striking was that he, too, had\r\nconsidered Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch capable of any mad action even when\r\nin the full possession of his faculties. At the club, too, people were\r\nashamed and wondered how it was they had failed to \"see the elephant\"\r\nand had missed the only explanation of all these marvels: there were,\r\nof course, sceptics among them, but they could not long maintain their\r\nposition.","Nikolay was in bed for more than two months. A famous doctor was\r\nsummoned from Moscow for a consultation; the whole town called on\r\nVarvara Petrovna. She forgave them. When in the spring Nikolay had\r\ncompletely recovered and assented without discussion to his mother's\r\nproposal that he should go for a tour to Italy, she begged him further\r\nto pay visits of farewell to all the neighbours, and so far as possible\r\nto apologise where necessary.","Nikolay agreed with great alacrity. It\r\nbecame known at the club that he had had a most delicate explanation\r\nwith Pyotr Pavlovitch Gaganov, at the house of the latter, who had been\r\ncompletely satisfied with his apology. As he went round to pay these\r\ncalls Nikolay was very grave and even gloomy. Every one appeared to\r\nreceive him sympathetically, but everybody seemed embarrassed and glad\r\nthat he was going to Italy.","Ivan Ossipovitch was positively tearful, but\r\nwas, for some reason, unable to bring himself to embrace him, even\r\nat the final leave-taking. It is true that some of us retained the\r\nconviction that the scamp had simply been making fun of us, and that the\r\nillness was neither here nor there. He went to see Liputin too.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" he said, \"how could you guess beforehand what I should say\r\nabout your sense and prime Agafya with an answer to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" laughed Liputin, \"it was because I recognised that you were a\r\nclever man, and so I foresaw what your answer would be.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyway, it was a remarkable coincidence. But, excuse me, did you\r\nconsider me a sensible man and not insane when you sent Agafya?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the cleverest and most rational, and I only pretended to believe\r\nthat you were insane.... And you guessed at once what was in my mind,\r\nand sent a testimonial to my wit through Agafya.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there you're a little mistaken. I really was... unwell...\"\r\nmuttered Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, frowning.","\"Bah!\" he cried, \"do you\r\nsuppose I'm capable of attacking people when I'm in my senses? What\r\nobject would there be in it?\"\r\n\r\nLiputin shrank together and didn't know what to answer. Nikolay turned\r\npale or, at least, so it seemed to Liputin.\r\n\r\n\"You have a very peculiar way of looking at things, anyhow,\" Nikolay\r\nwent on, \"but as for Agafya, I understand, of course, that you simply\r\nsent her to be rude to me.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't challenge you to a duel, could I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, of course! I seem to have heard that you're not fond of\r\nduels....\"\r\n\r\n\"Why borrow from the French?\" said Liputin, doubling up again.\r\n\r\n\"You're for nationalism, then?\"\r\n\r\nLiputin shrank into himself more than ever.\r\n\r\n\"Bah, bah! What do I see?\" cried Nicolas, noticing a volume of Consid√©rant\r\nin the most conspicuous place on the table.","\"You don't mean to say\r\nyou're a Fourierist! I'm afraid you must be! And isn't this too\r\nborrowing from the French?\" he laughed, tapping the book with his\r\nfinger.\r\n\r\n\"No, that's not taken from the French,\" Liputin cried with positive\r\nfury, jumping up from his chair. \"That is taken from the universal\r\nlanguage of humanity, not simply from the French. From the language of\r\nthe universal social republic and harmony of mankind, let me tell you!\r\nNot simply from the French!\"\r\n\r\n\"Foo! hang it all! There's no such language!\" laughed Nikolay.","Sometimes a trifle will catch the attention and exclusively absorb it\r\nfor a time. Most of what I have to tell of young Stavrogin will come\r\nlater. But I will note now as a curious fact that of all the impressions\r\nmade on him by his stay in our town, the one most sharply imprinted\r\non his memory was the unsightly and almost abject figure of the little\r\nprovincial official, the coarse and jealous family despot, the miserly\r\nmoney-lender who picked up the candle-ends and scraps left from dinner,\r\nand was at the same time a passionate believer in some visionary future\r\n\"social harmony,\" who at night gloated in ecstasies over fantastic\r\npictures of a future phalanstery, in the approaching realisation of\r\nwhich, in Russia, and in our province, he believed as firmly as in his\r\nown existence.","And that in the very place where he had saved up to\r\nbuy himself a \"little home,\" where he had married for the second time,\r\ngetting a dowry with his bride, where perhaps, for a hundred miles round\r\nthere was not one man, himself included, who was the very least like a\r\nfuture member \"of the universal human republic and social harmony.\"\r\n\r\n\"God knows how these people come to exist!\" Nikolay wondered, recalling\r\nsometimes the unlooked-for Fourierist.","IV\r\n\r\nOur prince travelled for over three years, so that he was almost\r\nforgotten in the town. We learned from Stepan Trofimovitch that he\r\nhad travelled all over Europe, that he had even been in Egypt and had\r\nvisited Jerusalem, and then had joined some scientific expedition to\r\nIceland, and he actually did go to Iceland. It was reported too that he\r\nhad spent one winter attending lectures in a German university.","He did\r\nnot write often to his mother, twice a year, or even less, but Varvara\r\nPetrovna was not angry or offended at this. She accepted submissively\r\nand without repining the relations that had been established once for\r\nall between her son and herself. She fretted for her \"Nicolas\" and\r\ndreamed of him continually. She kept her dreams and lamentations to\r\nherself. She seemed to have become less intimate even with Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch.","She was forming secret projects, and seemed to have become\r\nmore careful about money than ever. She was more than ever given to\r\nsaving money and being angry at Stepan Trofimovitch's losses at cards.\r\n\r\nAt last, in the April of this year, she received a letter from Paris\r\nfrom Praskovya Ivanovna Drozdov, the widow of the general and the\r\nfriend of Varvara Petrovna's childhood. Praskovya Ivanovna, whom Varvara\r\nPetrovna had not seen or corresponded with for eight years, wrote,\r\ninforming her that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had become very intimate\r\nwith them and a great friend of her only daughter, Liza, and that he was\r\nintending to accompany them to Switzerland, to Verney-Montreux,\r\nthough in the household of Count K.","(a very influential personage in\r\nPetersburg), who was now staying in Paris. He was received like a son\r\nof the family, so that he almost lived at the count's. The letter was\r\nbrief, and the object of it was perfectly clear, though it contained\r\nonly a plain statement of the above-mentioned facts without drawing any\r\ninferences from them. Varvara Petrovna did not pause long to consider;\r\nshe made up her mind instantly, made her preparations, and taking with\r\nher her prot√©g√©e, Dasha (Shatov's sister), she set off in the middle of\r\nApril for Paris, and from there went on to Switzerland.","She returned in\r\nJuly, alone, leaving Dasha with the Drozdovs. She brought us the news\r\nthat the Drozdovs themselves had promised to arrive among us by the end\r\nof August.\r\n\r\nThe Drozdovs, too, were landowners of our province, but the official\r\nduties of General Ivan Ivanovitch Drozdov (who had been a friend\r\nof Varvara Petrovna's and a colleague of her husband's) had always\r\nprevented them from visiting their magnificent estate.","On the death of\r\nthe general, which had taken place the year before, the inconsolable\r\nwidow had gone abroad with her daughter, partly in order to try the\r\ngrape-cure which she proposed to carry out at Verney-Montreux during the\r\nlatter half of the summer. On their return to Russia they intended to\r\nsettle in our province for good. She had a large house in the town which\r\nhad stood empty for many years with the windows nailed up.","They were\r\nwealthy people. Praskovya Ivanovna had been, in her first marriage, a\r\nMadame Tushin, and like her school-friend, Varvara Petrovna, was the\r\ndaughter of a government contractor of the old school, and she too had\r\nbeen an heiress at her marriage. Tushin, a retired cavalry captain, was\r\nalso a man of means, and of some ability. At his death he left a snug\r\nfortune to his only daughter Liza, a child of seven.","Now that Lizaveta\r\nNikolaevna was twenty-two her private fortune might confidently be\r\nreckoned at 200,000 roubles, to say nothing of the property--which was\r\nbound to come to her at the death of her mother, who had no children by\r\nher second marriage. Varvara Petrovna seemed to be very well satisfied\r\nwith her expedition. In her own opinion she had succeeded in coming to\r\na satisfactory understanding with Praskovya Ivanovna, and immediately\r\non her arrival she confided everything to Stepan Trofimovitch.","She was\r\npositively effusive with him as she had not been for a very long time.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Stepan Trofimovitch, and snapped his fingers.\r\n\r\nHe was in a perfect rapture, especially as he had spent the whole time\r\nof his friend's absence in extreme dejection. On setting off she had not\r\neven taken leave of him properly, and had said nothing of her plan to\r\n\"that old woman,\" dreading, perhaps, that he might chatter about it.","She was cross with him at the time on account of a considerable gambling\r\ndebt which she had suddenly discovered. But before she left Switzerland\r\nshe had felt that on her return she must make up for it to her forsaken\r\nfriend, especially as she had treated him very curtly for a long time\r\npast. Her abrupt and mysterious departure had made a profound and\r\npoignant impression on the timid heart of Stepan Trofimovitch, and to\r\nmake matters worse he was beset with other difficulties at the same\r\ntime.","He was worried by a very considerable money obligation, which had\r\nweighed upon him for a long time and which he could never hope to meet\r\nwithout Varvara Petrovna's assistance. Moreover, in the May of this\r\nyear, the term of office of our mild and gentle Ivan Ossipovitch came to\r\nan end. He was superseded under rather unpleasant circumstances. Then,\r\nwhile Varvara Petrovna was still away, there followed the arrival of\r\nour new governor, Andrey Antonovitch von Lembke, and with that a change\r\nbegan at once to be perceptible in the attitude of almost the whole\r\nof our provincial society towards Varvara Petrovna, and consequently\r\ntowards Stepan Trofimovitch.","He had already had time anyway to make some\r\ndisagreeable though valuable observations, and seemed very apprehensive\r\nalone without Varvara Petrovna. He had an agitating suspicion that he\r\nhad already been mentioned to the governor as a dangerous man. He knew\r\nfor a fact that some of our ladies meant to give up calling on Varvara\r\nPetrovna. Of our governor's wife (who was only expected to arrive in the\r\nautumn) it was reported that though she was, so it was heard, proud,\r\nshe was a real aristocrat, and \"not like that poor Varvara Petrovna.","\"\r\nEverybody seemed to know for a fact, and in the greatest detail, that\r\nour governor's wife and Varvara Petrovna had met already in society and\r\nhad parted enemies, so that the mere mention of Madame von Lembke's name\r\nwould, it was said, make a painful impression on Varvara Petrovna.\r\nThe confident and triumphant air of Varvara Petrovna, the contemptuous\r\nindifference with which she heard of the opinions of our provincial\r\nladies and the agitation in local society, revived the flagging spirits\r\nof Stepan Trofimovitch and cheered him up at once.","With peculiar,\r\ngleefully-obsequious humour, he was beginning to describe the new\r\ngovernor's arrival.\r\n\r\n\"You are no doubt aware, _excellente amie_,\" he said, jauntily\r\nand coquettishly drawling his words, \"what is meant by a Russian\r\nadministrator, speaking generally, and what is meant by a new Russian\r\nadministrator, that is the newly-baked, newly-established... _ces\r\ninterminables mots Russes!_ But I don't think you can know in practice\r\nwhat is meant by administrative ardour, and what sort of thing that is.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Administrative ardour? I don't know what that is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well... _Vous savez chez nous... En un mot,_  set the most insignificant\r\nnonentity to sell miserable tickets at a railway station, and the\r\nnonentity will at once feel privileged to look down on you like a\r\nJupiter, _pour montrer son pouvoir_ when you go to take a ticket. 'Now\r\nthen,' he says, 'I shall show you my power'... and in them it comes to a\r\ngenuine, administrative ardour.","_En un mot,_ I've read that some verger\r\nin one of our Russian churches abroad--_mais c'est tr√®s curieux_--drove,\r\nliterally drove a distinguished English family, _les dames charmantes_,\r\nout of the church before the beginning of the Lenten service... _vous\r\nsavez ces chants et le livre de Job_... on the simple pretext that\r\n'foreigners are not allowed to loaf about a Russian church, and that\r\nthey must come at the time fixed.","...' And he sent them into fainting\r\nfits.... That verger was suffering from an attack of administrative\r\nardour, _et il a montr√© son pouvoir_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cut it short if you can, Stepan Trofimovitch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. von Lembke is making a tour of the province now. _En un mot,_ this\r\nAndrey Antonovitch, though he is a russified German and of the Orthodox\r\npersuasion, and even--I will say that for him--a remarkably handsome man\r\nof about forty.","..\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes you think he's a handsome man? He has eyes like a sheep's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely so. But in this I yield, of course, to the opinion of our\r\nladies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's get on, Stepan Trofimovitch, I beg you! By the way, you're\r\nwearing a red neck-tie. Is it long since you've taken to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've... I've only put it on to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you take your constitutional? Do you go for a four-mile walk\r\nevery day as the doctor told you to?\"\r\n\r\n\"N-not.",".. always.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew you didn't! I felt sure of that when I was in Switzerland!\" she\r\ncried irritably. \"Now you must go not four but six miles a day! You've\r\ngrown terribly slack, terribly, terribly! You're not simply getting old,\r\nyou're getting decrepit.... You shocked me when I first saw you just\r\nnow, in spite of your red tie, _quelle idee rouge_! Go on about Von\r\nLembke if you've really something to tell me, and do finish some time, I\r\nentreat you, I'm tired.","\"\r\n\r\n\"_En un mot,_ I only wanted to say that he is one of those administrators\r\nwho begin to have power at forty, who, till they're forty, have been\r\nstagnating in insignificance and then suddenly come to the front through\r\nsuddenly acquiring a wife, or some other equally desperate means....\r\nThat is, he has gone away now... that is, I mean to say, it was at once\r\nwhispered in both his ears that I am a corrupter of youth, and a hot-bed\r\nof provincial atheism.","... He began making inquiries at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that true?\"\r\n\r\n\"I took steps about it, in fact. When he was 'informed' that you 'ruled\r\nthe province,' _vous savez,_ he allowed himself to use the expression that\r\n'there shall be nothing of that sort in the future.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he say that?\"\r\n\r\n\"That 'there shall be nothing of the sort in future,' and, _avec cette\r\nmorgue_.... His wife, Yulia Mihailovna, we shall behold at the end of\r\nAugust, she's coming straight from Petersburg.","\"\r\n\r\n\"From abroad. We met there.\"\r\n\r\n_\"Vraiment?\"_\r\n\r\n\"In Paris and in Switzerland. She's related to the Drozdovs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Related! What an extraordinary coincidence! They say she is ambitious\r\nand... supposed to have great connections.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! Connections indeed! She was an old maid without a farthing\r\ntill she was five-and-forty. But now she's hooked her Von Lembke,\r\nand, of course, her whole object is to push him forward.","They're both\r\nintriguers.\"\r\n\r\n\"And they say she's two years older than he is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five. Her mother used to wear out her skirts on my doorsteps in Moscow;\r\nshe used to beg for an invitation to our balls as a favour when my\r\nhusband was living. And this creature used to sit all night alone in a\r\ncorner without dancing, with her turquoise fly on her forehead, so that\r\nsimply from pity I used to have to send her her first partner at two\r\no'clock in the morning.","She was five-and-twenty then, and they used to\r\nrig her out in short skirts like a little girl. It was improper to have\r\nthem about at last.\"\r\n\r\n\"I seem to see that fly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you, as soon as I arrived I was in the thick of an intrigue. You\r\nread Madame Drozdov's letter, of course. What could be clearer? What did\r\nI find? That fool Praskovya herself--she always was a fool--looked at\r\nme as much as to ask why I'd come.","You can fancy how surprised I was.\r\nI looked round, and there was that Lembke woman at her tricks, and that\r\ncousin of hers--old Drozdov's nephew--it was all clear. You may be sure\r\nI changed all that in a twinkling, and Praskovya is on my side again,\r\nbut what an intrigue!\"\r\n\r\n\"In which you came off victor, however. Bismarck!\"\r\n\r\n\"Without being a Bismarck I'm equal to falseness and stupidity wherever\r\nI meet it, falseness, and Praskovya's folly.","I don't know when I've met\r\nsuch a flabby woman, and what's more her legs are swollen, and she's\r\na good-natured simpleton, too. What can be more foolish than a\r\ngood-natured simpleton?\"\r\n\r\n\"A spiteful fool, _ma bonne amie,_ a spiteful fool is still more foolish,\"\r\nStepan Trofimovitch protested magnanimously.\r\n\r\n\"You're right, perhaps. Do you remember Liza?\"\r\n\r\n_\"Charmante enfant!\"_\r\n\r\n\"But she's not an _enfant_ now, but a woman, and a woman of character.","She's a generous, passionate creature, and what I like about her, she\r\nstands up to that confiding fool, her mother. There was almost a row\r\nover that cousin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah, and of course he's no relation of Lizaveta Nikolaevna's at\r\nall.... Has he designs on her?\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, he's a young officer, not by any means talkative, modest in\r\nfact. I always want to be just. I fancy he is opposed to the intrigue\r\nhimself, and isn't aiming at anything, and it was only the Von Lembke's\r\ntricks.","He had a great respect for Nicolas. You understand, it all\r\ndepends on Liza. But I left her on the best of terms with Nicolas,\r\nand he promised he would come to us in November. So it's only the Von\r\nLembke who is intriguing, and Praskovya is a blind woman. She suddenly\r\ntells me that all my suspicions are fancy. I told her to her face she\r\nwas a fool. I am ready to repeat it at the day of judgment.","And if it\r\nhadn't been for Nicolas begging me to leave it for a time, I wouldn't\r\nhave come away without unmasking that false woman. She's been trying\r\nto ingratiate herself with Count K. through Nicolas. She wants to\r\ncome between mother and son. But Liza's on our side, and I came to an\r\nunderstanding with Praskovya. Do you know that Karmazinov is a relation\r\nof hers?\"\r\n\r\n\"What? A relation of Madame von Lembke?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of hers.","Distant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Karmazinov, the novelist?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the writer. Why does it surprise you? Of course he considers\r\nhimself a great man. Stuck-up creature! She's coming here with him. Now\r\nshe's making a fuss of him out there. She's got a notion of setting up a\r\nsort of literary society here. He's coming for a month, he wants to sell\r\nhis last piece of property here. I very nearly met him in Switzerland,\r\nand was very anxious not to.","Though I hope he will deign to recognise\r\nme. He wrote letters to me in the old days, he has been in my house.\r\nI should like you to dress better, Stepan Trofimovitch; you're growing\r\nmore slovenly every day.... Oh, how you torment me! What are you reading\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I... I...\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand. The same as ever, friends and drinking, the club and\r\ncards, and the reputation of an atheist. I don't like that reputation,\r\nStepan Trofimovitch; I don't care for you to be called an atheist,\r\nparticularly now.","I didn't care for it in old days, for it's all nothing\r\nbut empty chatter. It must be said at last.\"\r\n\r\n_\"Mais, ma ch√®re...\"_\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Stepan Trofimovitch, of course I'm ignorant compared with you\r\non all learned subjects, but as I was travelling here I thought a great\r\ndeal about you. I've come to one conclusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"What conclusion?\"\r\n\r\n\"That you and I are not the wisest people in the world, but that there\r\nare people wiser than we are.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Witty and apt. If there are people wiser than we are, then there are\r\npeople more right than we are, and we may be mistaken, you mean? _Mais,\r\nma bonne amie,_ granted that I may make a mistake, yet have I not the\r\ncommon, human, eternal, supreme right of freedom of conscience? I have\r\nthe right not to be bigoted or superstitious if I don't wish to, and for\r\nthat I shall naturally be hated by certain persons to the end of time.","_Et puis, comme on trouve toujours plus de moines que de raison,_ and as I\r\nthoroughly agree with that...\"\r\n\r\n\"What, what did you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said, _on trouve toujours plus de moines que de raison,_ and as I\r\nthoroughly...\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure that's not your saying. You must have taken it from\r\nsomewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was Pascal said that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as I thought...it's not your own. Why don't you ever say anything\r\nlike that yourself, so shortly and to the point, instead of dragging\r\nthings out to such a length? That's much better than what you said just\r\nnow about administrative ardour.","..\"\r\n\r\n_\"Ma foi, ch√®re...\" _why? In the first place probably because I'm not\r\na Pascal after all, _et puis_... secondly, we Russians never can say\r\nanything in our own language.... We never have said anything hitherto,\r\nat any rate....\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm! That's not true, perhaps. Anyway, you'd better make a note of such\r\nphrases, and remember them, you know, in case you have to talk....\r\nAch, Stephan Trofimovitch.","I have come to talk to you seriously, quite\r\nseriously.\"\r\n\r\n_\"Ch√®re, ch√®re amie!\"_\r\n\r\n\"Now that all these Von Lembkes and Karmazinovs.... Oh, my goodness, how\r\nyou have deteriorated!... Oh, my goodness, how you do torment me!...\r\nI should have liked these people to feel a respect for you, for they're\r\nnot worth your little finger--but the way you behave!... What will they\r\nsee? What shall I have to show them? Instead of nobly standing as an\r\nexample, keeping up the tradition of the past, you surround yourself\r\nwith a wretched rabble, you have picked up impossible habits, you've\r\ngrown feeble, you can't do without wine and cards, you read nothing\r\nbut Paul de Kock, and write nothing, while all of them write; all your\r\ntime's wasted in gossip.","How can you bring yourself to be friends with a\r\nwretched creature like your inseparable Liputin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why is he _mine_ and _inseparable_?\" Stepan Trofimovitch protested\r\ntimidly.\r\n\r\n\"Where is he now?\" Varvara Petrovna went on, sharply and sternly.\r\n\r\n\"He... he has an infinite respect for you, and he's gone to S----k, to\r\nreceive an inheritance left him by his mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"He seems to do nothing but get money.","And how's Shatov? Is he just the\r\nsame?\"\r\n\r\n_\"Irascible, mais bon.\"_\r\n\r\n\"I can't endure your Shatov. He's spiteful and he thinks too much of\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is Darya Pavlovna?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean Dasha? What made you think of her?\" Varvara Petrovna looked\r\nat him inquisitively. \"She's quite well. I left her with the Drozdovs. I\r\nheard something about your son in Switzerland. Nothing good.\"\r\n\r\n_\"Oh, c'est un histoire bien b√™te! Je vous attendais, ma bonne amie, pour\r\nvous raconter.","..\"_\r\n\r\n\"Enough, Stepan Trofimovitch. Leave me in peace. I'm worn out. We\r\nshall have time to talk to our heart's content, especially of what's\r\nunpleasant. You've begun to splutter when you laugh, it's a sign of\r\nsenility! And what a strange way of laughing you've taken to!... Good\r\nHeavens, what a lot of bad habits you've fallen into! Karmazinov won't\r\ncome and see you! And people are only too glad to make the most of\r\nanything as it is.","... You've betrayed yourself completely now. Well,\r\ncome, that's enough, that's enough, I'm tired. You really might have\r\nmercy upon one!\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch \"had mercy,\" but he withdrew in great perturbation.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nOur friend certainly had fallen into not a few bad habits, especially of\r\nlate. He had obviously and rapidly deteriorated; and it was true that\r\nhe had become slovenly. He drank more and had become more tearful and\r\nnervous; and had grown too impressionable on the artistic side.","His\r\nface had acquired a strange facility for changing with extraordinary\r\nquickness, from the most solemn expression, for instance, to the most\r\nabsurd, and even foolish. He could not endure solitude, and was always\r\ncraving for amusement. One had always to repeat to him some gossip, some\r\nlocal anecdote, and every day a new one. If no one came to see him for\r\na long time he wandered disconsolately about the rooms, walked to the\r\nwindow, puckering up his lips, heaved deep sighs, and almost fell to\r\nwhimpering at last.","He was always full of forebodings, was afraid of\r\nsomething unexpected and inevitable; he had become timorous; he began to\r\npay great attention to his dreams.\r\n\r\nHe spent all that day and evening in great depression, he sent for me,\r\nwas very much agitated, talked a long while, gave me a long account of\r\nthings, but all rather disconnected. Varvara Petrovna had known for a\r\nlong time that he concealed nothing from me.","It seemed to me at last\r\nthat he was worried about something particular, and was perhaps unable\r\nto form a definite idea of it himself. As a rule when we met _t√™te-√†-t√™te_\r\nand he began making long complaints to me, a bottle was almost always\r\nbrought in after a little time, and things became much more comfortable.\r\nThis time there was no wine, and he was evidently struggling all the\r\nwhile against the desire to send for it.","\"And why is she always so cross?\" he complained every minute, like a\r\nchild. _\"Tous les hommes de g√©nie et de progr√®s en Russie √©taient,\r\nsont, et seront toujours des_ gamblers _et des_ drunkards _qui boivent_ in\r\noutbreaks... and I'm not such a gambler after all, and I'm not such a\r\ndrunkard. She reproaches me for not writing anything. Strange\r\nidea!... She asks why I lie down? She says I ought to stand, 'an example\r\nand reproach.","' _Mais, entre nous soit dit,_ what is a man to do who is\r\ndestined to stand as a 'reproach,' if not to lie down? Does she\r\nunderstand that?\"\r\n\r\nAnd at last it became clear to me what was the chief particular trouble\r\nwhich was worrying him so persistently at this time. Many times that\r\nevening he went to the looking-glass, and stood a long while before\r\nit. At last he turned from the looking-glass to me, and with a sort\r\nof strange despair, said: \"_Mon cher, je suis un_ broken-down man.","\" Yes,\r\ncertainly, up to that time, up to that very day there was one thing only\r\nof which he had always felt confident in spite of the \"new views,\" and\r\nof the \"change in Varvara Petrovna's ideas,\" that was, the conviction\r\nthat still he had a fascination for her feminine heart, not simply as an\r\nexile or a celebrated man of learning, but as a handsome man. For twenty\r\nyears this soothing and flattering opinion had been rooted in his mind,\r\nand perhaps of all his convictions this was the hardest to part with.","Had he any presentiment that evening of the colossal ordeal which was\r\npreparing for him in the immediate future?\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nI will now enter upon the description of that almost forgotten incident\r\nwith which my story properly speaking begins.\r\n\r\nAt last at the very end of August the Drozdovs returned. Their arrival\r\nmade a considerable sensation in local society, and took place shortly\r\nbefore their relation, our new governor's wife, made her long-expected\r\nappearance.","But of all these interesting events I will speak later.\r\nFor the present I will confine myself to saying that Praskovya Ivanovna\r\nbrought Varvara Petrovna, who was expecting her so impatiently, a most\r\nperplexing problem: Nikolay had parted from them in July, and,\r\nmeeting Count K. on the Rhine, had set off with him and his family for\r\nPetersburg. (N.B.--The Count's three daughters were all of marriageable\r\nage.",")\r\n\r\n\"Lizaveta is so proud and obstinate that I could get nothing out of\r\nher,\" Praskovya Ivanovna said in conclusion. \"But I saw for myself that\r\nsomething had happened between her and Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch. I don't\r\nknow the reasons, but I fancy, my dear Varvara Petrovna, that you\r\nwill have to ask your Darya Pavlovna for them. To my thinking Liza\r\nwas offended. I'm glad. I can tell you that I've brought you back your\r\nfavourite at last and handed her over to you; it's a weight off my\r\nmind.","\"\r\n\r\nThese venomous words were uttered with remarkable irritability. It was\r\nevident that the \"flabby\" woman had prepared them and gloated beforehand\r\nover the effect they would produce. But Varvara Petrovna was not the\r\nwoman to be disconcerted by sentimental effects and enigmas. She sternly\r\ndemanded the most precise and satisfactory explanations. Praskovya\r\nIvanovna immediately lowered her tone and even ended by dissolving into\r\ntears and expressions of the warmest friendship.","This irritable but\r\nsentimental lady, like Stepan Trofimovitch, was forever yearning for\r\ntrue friendship, and her chief complaint against her daughter Lizaveta\r\nNikolaevna was just that \"her daughter was not a friend to her.\"\r\n\r\nBut from all her explanations and outpourings nothing certain could be\r\ngathered but that there actually had been some sort of quarrel between\r\nLiza and Nikolay, but of the nature of the quarrel Praskovya Ivanovna\r\nwas obviously unable to form a definite idea.","As for her imputations\r\nagainst Darya Pavlovna, she not only withdrew them completely in the\r\nend, but even particularly begged Varvara Petrovna to pay no attention\r\nto her words, because \"they had been said in irritation.\" In fact, it\r\nhad all been left very far from clear--suspicious, indeed. According to\r\nher account the quarrel had arisen from Liza's \"obstinate and ironical\r\ncharacter.\" \"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch is proud, too, and though he\r\nwas very much in love, yet he could not endure sarcasm, and began to be\r\nsarcastic himself.","Soon afterwards we made the acquaintance of a\r\nyoung man, the nephew, I believe, of your 'Professor' and, indeed, the\r\nsurname's the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"The son, not the nephew,\" Varvara Petrovna corrected her.\r\n\r\nEven in old days Praskovya Ivanovna had been always unable to recall\r\nStepan Trofimovitch's name, and had always called him the \"Professor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, his son, then; so much the better. Of course, it's all the same\r\nto me.","An ordinary young man, very lively and free in his manners, but\r\nnothing special in him. Well, then, Liza herself did wrong, she\r\nmade friends with the young man with the idea of making Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch jealous. I don't see much harm in that; it's the way of\r\ngirls, quite usual, even charming in them. Only instead of being jealous\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch made friends with the young man himself, just as\r\nthough he saw nothing and didn't care.","This made Liza furious. The young\r\nman soon went away (he was in a great hurry to get somewhere) and\r\nLiza took to picking quarrels with Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch at every\r\nopportunity. She noticed that he used sometimes to talk to Dasha; and,\r\nwell, she got in such a frantic state that even my life wasn't worth\r\nliving, my dear. The doctors have forbidden my being irritated, and I\r\nwas so sick of their lake they make such a fuss about, it simply gave me\r\ntoothache, I had such rheumatism.","It's stated in print that the Lake of\r\nGeneva does give people the toothache. It's a feature of the place. Then\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch suddenly got a letter from the countess and he\r\nleft us at once. He packed up in one day. They parted in a friendly way,\r\nand Liza became very cheerful and frivolous, and laughed a great deal\r\nseeing him off; only that was all put on. When he had gone she became\r\nvery thoughtful, and she gave up speaking of him altogether and wouldn't\r\nlet me mention his name.","And I should advise you, dear Varvara Petrovna,\r\nnot to approach the subject with Liza, you'll only do harm. But if you\r\nhold your tongue she'll begin to talk of it herself, and then you'll\r\nlearn more. I believe they'll come together again, if only Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch doesn't put off coming, as he promised.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll write to him at once. If that's how it was, there was nothing in\r\nthe quarrel; all nonsense! And I know Darya too well.","It's nonsense!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry for what I said about Dashenka, I did wrong. Their\r\nconversations were quite ordinary and they talked out loud, too. But it\r\nall upset me so much at the time, my dear. And Liza, I saw, got on with\r\nher again as affectionately as before....\"\r\n\r\nThat very day Varvara Petrovna wrote to Nikolay, and begged him to come,\r\nif only one month, earlier than the date he had fixed.","But yet she still\r\nfelt that there was something unexplained and obscure in the matter.\r\nShe pondered over it all the evening and all night. Praskovya's opinion\r\nseemed to her too innocent and sentimental. \"Praskovya has always\r\nbeen too sentimental from the old schooldays upwards,\" she reflected.\r\n\"Nicolas is not the man to run away from a girl's taunts. There's some\r\nother reason for it, if there really has been a breach between them.","That officer's here though, they've brought him with them. As a relation\r\nhe lives in their house. And, as for Darya, Praskovya was in too much\r\nhaste to apologise. She must have kept something to herself, which she\r\nwouldn't tell me.\"\r\n\r\nBy the morning Varvara Petrovna had matured a project for putting a stop\r\nonce for all to one misunderstanding at least; a project amazing in its\r\nunexpectedness.","What was in her heart when she conceived it? It would\r\nbe hard to decide and I will not undertake to explain beforehand all\r\nthe incongruities of which it was made up. I simply confine myself as\r\nchronicler to recording events precisely as they happened, and it is not\r\nmy fault if they seem incredible. Yet I must once more testify that by\r\nthe morning there was not the least suspicion of Dasha left in Varvara\r\nPetrovna's mind, though in reality there never had been any--she had\r\ntoo much confidence in her.","Besides, she could not admit the idea that\r\n\"Nicolas\" could be attracted by her Darya. Next morning when Darya\r\nPavlovna was pouring out tea at the table Varvara Petrovna looked for a\r\nlong while intently at her and, perhaps for the twentieth time since the\r\nprevious day, repeated to herself: \"It's all nonsense!\"\r\n\r\nAll she noticed was that Dasha looked rather tired, and that she was\r\neven quieter and more apathetic than she used to be.","After their morning\r\ntea, according to their invariable custom, they sat down to needlework.\r\nVarvara Petrovna demanded from her a full account of her impressions\r\nabroad, especially of nature, of the inhabitants, of the towns, the\r\ncustoms, their arts and commerce--of everything she had time to observe.\r\nShe asked no questions about the Drozdovs or how she had got on with\r\nthem. Dasha, sitting beside her at the work-table helping her with the\r\nembroidery, talked for half an hour in her even, monotonous, but rather\r\nweak voice.","\"Darya!\" Varvara Petrovna interrupted suddenly, \"is there nothing\r\nspecial you want to tell me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, nothing,\" said Dasha, after a moment's thought, and she glanced at\r\nVarvara Petrovna with her light-coloured eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing on your soul, on your heart, or your conscience?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" Dasha repeated, quietly, but with a sort of sullen firmness.\r\n\r\n\"I knew there wasn't! Believe me, Darya, I shall never doubt you.","Now\r\nsit still and listen. In front of me, on that chair. I want to see the\r\nwhole of you. That's right. Listen, do you want to be married?\"\r\n\r\nDasha responded with a long, inquiring, but not greatly astonished look.\r\n\r\n\"Stay, hold your tongue. In the first place there is a very great\r\ndifference in age, but of course you know better than anyone what\r\nnonsense that is. You're a sensible girl, and there must be no mistakes\r\nin your life.","Besides, he's still a handsome man... In short, Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch, for whom you have always had such a respect. Well?\"\r\n\r\nDasha looked at her still more inquiringly, and this time not simply\r\nwith surprise; she blushed perceptibly.\r\n\r\n\"Stay, hold your tongue, don't be in a hurry! Though you will have money\r\nunder my will, yet when I die, what will become of you, even if you have\r\nmoney? You'll be deceived and robbed of your money, you'll be lost in\r\nfact.","But married to him you're the wife of a distinguished man. Look at\r\nhim on the other hand. Though I've provided for him, if I die what will\r\nbecome of him? But I could trust him to you. Stay, I've not finished.\r\nHe's frivolous, shilly-shally, cruel, egoistic, he has low habits. But\r\nmind you think highly of him, in the first place because there are many\r\nworse. I don't want to get you off my hands by marrying you to a rascal,\r\nyou don't imagine anything of that sort, do you? And, above all, because\r\nI ask you, you'll think highly of him,\"--\r\n\r\nShe broke off suddenly and irritably.","\"Do you hear? Why won't you say\r\nsomething?\"\r\n\r\nDasha still listened and did not speak.\r\n\r\n\"Stay, wait a little. He's an old woman, but you know, that's all the\r\nbetter for you. Besides, he's a pathetic old woman. He doesn't deserve\r\nto be loved by a woman at all, but he deserves to be loved for his\r\nhelplessness, and you must love him for his helplessness. You understand\r\nme, don't you? Do you understand me?\"\r\n\r\nDasha nodded her head affirmatively.","\"I knew you would. I expected as much of you. He will love you because\r\nhe ought, he ought; he ought to adore you.\" Varvara Petrovna almost\r\nshrieked with peculiar exasperation. \"Besides, he will be in love with\r\nyou without any ought about it. I know him. And another thing, I shall\r\nalways be here. You may be sure I shall always be here. He will complain\r\nof you, he'll begin to say things against you behind your back, he'll\r\nwhisper things against you to any stray person he meets, he'll be for\r\never whining and whining; he'll write you letters from one room to\r\nanother, two a day, but he won't be able to get on without you all the\r\nsame, and that's the chief thing.","Make him obey you. If you can't make\r\nhim you'll be a fool. He'll want to hang himself and threaten, to--don't\r\nyou believe it. It's nothing but nonsense. Don't believe it; but still\r\nkeep a sharp look-out, you never can tell, and one day he may hang\r\nhimself. It does happen with people like that. It's not through strength\r\nof will but through weakness that people hang themselves, and so\r\nnever drive him to an extreme, that's the first rule in married life.","Remember, too, that he's a poet. Listen, Dasha, there's no greater\r\nhappiness than self-sacrifice. And besides, you'll be giving me great\r\nsatisfaction and that's the chief thing. Don't think I've been talking\r\nnonsense. I understand what I'm saying. I'm an egoist, you be an egoist,\r\ntoo. Of course I'm not forcing you. It's entirely for you to decide.\r\nAs you say, so it shall be. Well, what's the good of sitting like this.","Speak!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind, Varvara Petrovna, if I really must be married,\" said\r\nDasha firmly.\r\n\r\n\"Must? What are you hinting at?\" Varvara Petrovna looked sternly and\r\nintently at her.\r\n\r\nDasha was silent, picking at her embroidery canvas with her needle.\r\n\r\n\"Though you're a clever girl, you're talking nonsense; though it is true\r\nthat I have certainly set my heart on marrying you, yet it's not because\r\nit's necessary, but simply because the idea has occurred to me, and only\r\nto Stepan Trofimovitch.","If it had not been for Stepan Trofimovitch, I\r\nshould not have thought of marrying you yet, though you are twenty....\r\nWell?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do as you wish, Varvara Petrovna.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you consent! Stay, be quiet. Why are you in such a hurry? I\r\nhaven't finished. In my will I've left you fifteen thousand roubles.\r\nI'll give you that at once, on your wedding-day. You will give eight\r\nthousand of it to him; that is, not to him but to me.","He has a debt of\r\neight thousand. I'll pay it, but he must know that it is done with your\r\nmoney. You'll have seven thousand left in your hands. Never let him\r\ntouch a farthing of it. Don't pay his debts ever. If once you pay them,\r\nyou'll never be free of them. Besides, I shall always be here. You\r\nshall have twelve hundred roubles a year from me, with extras, fifteen\r\nhundred, besides board and lodging, which shall be at my expense, just\r\nas he has it now.","Only you must set up your own servants. Your yearly\r\nallowance shall be paid to you all at once straight into your hands. But\r\nbe kind, and sometimes give him something, and let his friends come to\r\nsee him once a week, but if they come more often, turn them out. But\r\nI shall be here, too. And if I die, your pension will go on till his\r\ndeath, do you hear, till his death, for it's his pension, not yours.","And besides the seven thousand you'll have now, which you ought to keep\r\nuntouched if you're not foolish, I'll leave you another eight thousand\r\nin my will. And you'll get nothing more than that from me, it's right\r\nthat you should know it. Come, you consent, eh? Will you say something\r\nat last?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have told you already, Varvara Petrovna.\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember that you're free to decide. As you like, so it shall be.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, may I ask, Varvara Petrovna, has Stepan Trofimovitch said\r\nanything yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he hasn't said anything, he doesn't know... but he will speak\r\ndirectly.\"\r\n\r\nShe jumped up at once and threw on a black shawl. Dasha flushed a little\r\nagain, and watched her with questioning eyes. Varvara Petrovna turned\r\nsuddenly to her with a face flaming with anger.\r\n\r\n\"You're a fool!\" She swooped down on her like a hawk.","\"An ungrateful\r\nfool! What's in your mind? Can you imagine that I'd compromise you, in\r\nany way, in the smallest degree. Why, he shall crawl on his knees to\r\nask you, he must be dying of happiness, that's how it shall be arranged.\r\nWhy, you know that I'd never let you suffer. Or do you suppose he'll\r\ntake you for the sake of that eight thousand, and that I'm hurrying off\r\nto sell you? You're a fool, a fool! You're all ungrateful fools.","Give me\r\nmy umbrella!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she flew off to walk by the wet brick pavements and the wooden\r\nplanks to Stepan Trofimovitch's.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nIt was true that she would never have let Dasha suffer; on the contrary,\r\nshe considered now that she was acting as her benefactress. The most\r\ngenerous and legitimate indignation was glowing in her soul, when, as\r\nshe put on her shawl, she caught fixed upon her the embarrassed and\r\nmistrustful eyes of her prot√©g√©e.","She had genuinely loved the girl from\r\nher childhood upwards. Praskovya Ivanovna had with justice called Darya\r\nPavlovna her favourite. Long ago Varvara Petrovna had made up her mind\r\nonce for all that \"Darya's disposition was not like her brother's\" (not,\r\nthat is, like Ivan Shatov's), that she was quiet and gentle, and capable\r\nof great self-sacrifice; that she was distinguished by a power of\r\ndevotion, unusual modesty, rare reasonableness, and, above all, by\r\ngratitude.","Till that time Dasha had, to all appearances, completely\r\njustified her expectations.\r\n\r\n\"In that life there will be no mistakes,\" said Varvara Petrovna when the\r\ngirl was only twelve years old, and as it was characteristic of her to\r\nattach herself doggedly and passionately to any dream that fascinated\r\nher, any new design, any idea that struck her as noble, she made up her\r\nmind at once to educate Dasha as though she were her own daughter.","She\r\nat once set aside a sum of money for her, and sent for a governess, Miss\r\nCriggs, who lived with them until the girl was sixteen, but she was\r\nfor some reason suddenly dismissed. Teachers came for her from the High\r\nSchool, among them a real Frenchman, who taught Dasha French. He, too,\r\nwas suddenly dismissed, almost turned out of the house. A poor lady, a\r\nwidow of good family, taught her to play the piano.","Yet her chief tutor\r\nwas Stepan Trofimovitch.\r\n\r\nIn reality he first discovered Dasha. He began teaching the quiet child\r\neven before Varvara Petrovna had begun to think about her. I repeat\r\nagain, it was wonderful how children took to him. Lizaveta Nikolaevna\r\nTushin had been taught by him from the age of eight till eleven (Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch took no fees, of course, for his lessons, and would not on\r\nany account have taken payment from the Drozdovs).","But he fell in love\r\nwith the charming child and used to tell her poems of a sort about the\r\ncreation of the world, about the earth, and the history of humanity.\r\nHis lectures about the primitive peoples and primitive man were more\r\ninteresting than the Arabian Nights. Liza, who was ecstatic over these\r\nstories, used to mimic Stepan Trofimovitch very funnily at home. He\r\nheard of this and once peeped in on her unawares.","Liza, overcome\r\nwith confusion, flung herself into his arms and shed tears; Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch wept too with delight. But Liza soon after went away, and\r\nonly Dasha was left. When Dasha began to have other teachers, Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch gave up his lessons with her, and by degrees left off\r\nnoticing her. Things went on like this for a long time. Once when she\r\nwas seventeen he was struck by her prettiness.","It happened at Varvara\r\nPetrovna's table. He began to talk to the young girl, was much pleased\r\nwith her answers, and ended by offering to give her a serious and\r\ncomprehensive course of lessons on the history of Russian literature.\r\nVarvara Petrovna approved, and thanked him for his excellent idea,\r\nand Dasha was delighted. Stepan Trofimovitch proceeded to make special\r\npreparations for the lectures, and at last they began.","They began\r\nwith the most ancient period. The first lecture went off enchantingly.\r\nVarvara Petrovna was present. When Stepan Trofimovitch had finished, and\r\nas he was going informed his pupil that the next time he would deal with\r\n\"The Story of the Expedition of Igor,\" Varvara Petrovna suddenly got up\r\nand announced that there would be no more lessons. Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nwinced, but said nothing, and Dasha flushed crimson.","It put a stop to\r\nthe scheme, however. This had happened just three years before Varvara\r\nPetrovna's unexpected fancy.\r\n\r\nPoor Stepan Trofimovitch was sitting alone free from all misgivings.\r\nPlunged in mournful reveries he had for some time been looking out of\r\nthe window to see whether any of his friends were coming. But nobody\r\nwould come. It was drizzling. It was turning cold, he would have to have\r\nthe stove heated.","He sighed. Suddenly a terrible apparition flashed upon\r\nhis eyes:\r\n\r\nVarvara Petrovna in such weather and at such an unexpected hour to see\r\nhim! And on foot! He was so astounded that he forgot to put on his\r\ncoat, and received her as he was, in his everlasting pink-wadded\r\ndressing-jacket.\r\n\r\n_\"Ma bonne amie!\"_ he cried faintly, to greet her. \"You're alone; I'm\r\nglad; I can't endure your friends.","How you do smoke! Heavens, what an\r\natmosphere! You haven't finished your morning tea and it's nearly twelve\r\no'clock. It's your idea of bliss--disorder! You take pleasure in dirt.\r\nWhat's that torn paper on the floor? Nastasya, Nastasya! What is\r\nyour Nastasya about? Open the window, the casement, the doors, fling\r\neverything wide open. And we'll go into the drawing-room. I've come to\r\nyou on a matter of importance.","And you sweep up, my good woman, for once\r\nin your life.\"\r\n\r\n\"They make such a muck!\" Nastasya whined in a voice of plaintive\r\nexasperation.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you must sweep, sweep it up fifteen times a day! You've a\r\nwretched drawing-room\" (when they had gone into the drawing-room). \"Shut\r\nthe door properly. She'll be listening. You must have it repapered.\r\nDidn't I send a paperhanger to you with patterns? Why didn't you choose\r\none? Sit down, and listen.","Do sit down, I beg you. Where are you off to?\r\nWhere are you off to? Where are you off to?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be back directly,\" Stepan Trofimovitch cried from the next room.\r\n\"Here I am again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,--you've changed your coat.\" She scanned him mockingly. (He had\r\nflung his coat on over the dressing-jacket.) \"Well, certainly that's\r\nmore suited to our subject. Do sit down, I entreat you.\"\r\n\r\nShe told him everything at once, abruptly and impressively.","She hinted at\r\nthe eight thousand of which he stood in such terrible need. She told him\r\nin detail of the dowry. Stepan Trofimovitch sat trembling, opening\r\nhis eyes wider and wider. He heard it all, but he could not realise it\r\nclearly. He tried to speak, but his voice kept breaking. All he knew\r\nwas that everything would be as she said, that to protest and refuse to\r\nagree would be useless, and that he was a married man irrevocably.","_\"Mais, ma bonne amie!_...for the third time, and at my age...and to\r\nsuch a child.\" He brought out at last, _\"Mais, c'est une enfant!\"_\r\n\r\n\"A child who is twenty years old, thank God. Please don't roll your\r\neyes, I entreat you, you're not on the stage. You're very clever and\r\nlearned, but you know nothing at all about life. You will always want a\r\nnurse to look after you. I shall die, and what will become of you?\r\nShe will be a good nurse to you; she's a modest girl, strong-willed,\r\nreasonable; besides, I shall be here too, I shan't die directly.","She's\r\nfond of home, she's an angel of gentleness. This happy thought came to\r\nme in Switzerland. Do you understand if I tell you myself that she is\r\nan angel of gentleness!\" she screamed with sudden fury. \"Your house is\r\ndirty, she will bring in order, cleanliness. Everything will shine like\r\na mirror. Good gracious, do you expect me to go on my knees to you with\r\nsuch a treasure, to enumerate all the advantages, to court you! Why, you\r\nought to be on your knees.","... Oh, you shallow, shallow, faint-hearted\r\nman!\"\r\n\r\n\"But... I'm an old man!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do your fifty-three years matter! Fifty is the middle of life,\r\nnot the end of it. You are a handsome man and you know it yourself. You\r\nknow, too, what a respect she has for you. If I die, what will become of\r\nher? But married to you she'll be at peace, and I shall be at peace. You\r\nhave renown, a name, a loving heart.","You receive a pension which I look\r\nupon as an obligation. You will save her perhaps, you will save her! In\r\nany case you will be doing her an honour. You will form her for life,\r\nyou will develop her heart, you will direct her ideas. How many people\r\ncome to grief nowadays because their ideas are wrongly directed. By that\r\ntime your book will be ready, and you will at once set people talking\r\nabout you again.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I am, in fact,\" he muttered, at once flattered by Varvara Petrovna's\r\nadroit insinuations. \"I was just preparing to sit down to my 'Tales from\r\nSpanish History.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there you are. It's just come right.\"\r\n\r\n\"But... she? Have you spoken to her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about her. And there's no need for you to be inquisitive.\r\nOf course, you must ask her yourself, entreat her to do you the honour,\r\nyou understand? But don't be uneasy.","I shall be here. Besides, you love\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch felt giddy. The walls were going round. There was\r\none terrible idea underlying this to which he could not reconcile\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n_\"Excellente amie,\"_ his voice quivered suddenly. \"I could never have\r\nconceived that you would make up your mind to give me in marriage to\r\nanother... woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not a girl, Stepan Trofimovitch. Only girls are given in\r\nmarriage.","You are taking a wife,\" Varvara Petrovna hissed malignantly.\r\n\r\n_\"Oui, j'ai pris un mot pour un autre. Mais c'est √©gal.\"_ He gazed at her\r\nwith a hopeless air.\r\n\r\n\"I see that _c'est √©gal_,\" she muttered contemptuously through her teeth.\r\n\"Good heavens! Why he's going to faint. Nastasya, Nastasya, water!\"\r\n\r\nBut water was not needed. He came to himself. Varvara Petrovna took up\r\nher umbrella.\r\n\r\n\"I see it's no use talking to you now.","...\"\r\n\r\n_\"Oui, oui, je suis incapable.\"_\r\n\r\n\"But by to-morrow you'll have rested and thought it over. Stay at home.\r\nIf anything happens let me know, even if it's at night. Don't write\r\nletters, I shan't read them. To-morrow I'll come again at this time\r\nalone, for a final answer, and I trust it will be satisfactory. Try to\r\nhave nobody here and no untidiness, for the place isn't fit to be seen.\r\nNastasya, Nastasya!\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, of course, he consented, and, indeed, he could do nothing\r\nelse.","There was one circumstance...\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch's estate, as we used to call it (which consisted\r\nof fifty souls, reckoning in the old fashion, and bordered on\r\nSkvoreshniki), was not really his at all, but his first wife's, and\r\nso belonged now to his son Pyotr Stepanovitch Verhovensky. Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch was simply his trustee, and so, when the nestling was\r\nfull-fledged, he had given his father a formal authorisation to manage\r\nthe estate.","This transaction was a profitable one for the young man. He\r\nreceived as much as a thousand roubles a year by way of revenue from the\r\nestate, though under the new regime it could not have yielded more than\r\nfive hundred, and possibly not that. God knows how such an arrangement\r\nhad arisen. The whole sum, however, was sent the young man by Varvara\r\nPetrovna, and Stepan Trofimovitch had nothing to do with a single rouble\r\nof it.","On the other hand, the whole revenue from the land remained in\r\nhis pocket, and he had, besides, completely ruined the estate, letting\r\nit to a mercenary rogue, and without the knowledge of Varvara Petrovna\r\nselling the timber which gave the estate its chief value. He had some\r\ntime before sold the woods bit by bit. It was worth at least\r\neight thousand, yet he had only received five thousand for it.","But\r\nhe sometimes lost too much at the club, and was afraid to ask Varvara\r\nPetrovna for the money. She clenched her teeth when she heard at last of\r\neverything. And now, all at once, his son announced that he was\r\ncoming himself to sell his property for what he could get for it, and\r\ncommissioned his father to take steps promptly to arrange the sale. It\r\nwas clear that Stepan Trofimovitch, being a generous and disinterested\r\nman, felt ashamed of his treatment of _ce cher enfant_ (whom he had seen\r\nfor the last time nine years before as a student in Petersburg).","The\r\nestate might originally have been worth thirteen or fourteen thousand.\r\nNow it was doubtful whether anyone would give five for it. No doubt\r\nStepan Trofimovitch was fully entitled by the terms of the trust to sell\r\nthe wood, and taking into account the incredibly large yearly revenue of\r\na thousand roubles which had been sent punctually for so many years,\r\nhe could have put up a good defence of his management.","But Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch was a generous man of exalted impulses. A wonderfully fine\r\ninspiration occurred to his mind: when Petrusha returned, to lay on the\r\ntable before him the maximum price of fifteen thousand roubles without\r\na hint at the sums that had been sent him hitherto, and warmly and with\r\ntears to press _ce cher fils_ to his heart, and so to make an end of all\r\naccounts between them. He began cautiously and indirectly unfolding\r\nthis picture before Varvara Petrovna.","He hinted that this would add a\r\npeculiarly noble note to their friendship... to their \"idea.\" This\r\nwould set the parents of the last generation--and people of the last\r\ngeneration generally--in such a disinterested and magnanimous light in\r\ncomparison with the new frivolous and socialistic younger generation. He\r\nsaid a great deal more, but Varvara Petrovna was obstinately silent. At\r\nlast she informed him airily that she was prepared to buy their estate,\r\nand to pay for it the maximum price, that is, six or seven thousand\r\n(though four would have been a fair price for it).","Of the remaining\r\neight thousand which had vanished with the woods she said not a word.\r\n\r\nThis conversation took place a month before the match was proposed to\r\nhim. Stepan Trofimovitch was overwhelmed, and began to ponder. There\r\nmight in the past have been a hope that his son would not come,\r\nafter all--an outsider, that is to say, might have hoped so. Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch as a father would have indignantly rejected the\r\ninsinuation that he could entertain such a hope.","Anyway queer rumours\r\nhad hitherto been reaching us about Petrusha. To begin with, on\r\ncompleting his studies at the university six years before, he had hung\r\nabout in Petersburg without getting work. Suddenly we got the news that\r\nhe had taken part in issuing some anonymous manifesto and that he\r\nwas implicated in the affair. Then he suddenly turned up abroad in\r\nSwitzerland at Geneva--he had escaped, very likely.","\"It's surprising to me,\" Stepan Trofimovitch commented, greatly\r\ndisconcerted. \"Petrusha, _c'est une si pauvre t√™te!_ He's good,\r\nnoble-hearted, very sensitive, and I was so delighted with him in\r\nPetersburg, comparing him with the young people of to-day. But _c'est un\r\npauvre sire, tout de m√™me_.... And you know it all comes from that\r\nsame half-bakedness, that sentimentality. They are fascinated, not by\r\nrealism, but by the emotional ideal side of socialism, by the religious\r\nnote in it, so to say, by the poetry of it.",".. second-hand, of course.\r\nAnd for me, for me, think what it means! I have so many enemies here and\r\nmore still _there_, they'll put it down to the father's influence. Good\r\nGod! Petrusha a revolutionist! What times we live in!\"\r\n\r\nVery soon, however, Petrusha sent his exact address from Switzerland for\r\nmoney to be sent him as usual; so he could not be exactly an exile.\r\nAnd now, after four years abroad, he was suddenly making his appearance\r\nagain in his own country, and announced that he would arrive shortly,\r\nso there could be no charge against him.","What was more, someone seemed\r\nto be interested in him and protecting him. He wrote now from the south\r\nof Russia, where he was busily engaged in some private but important\r\nbusiness. All this was capital, but where was his father to get that\r\nother seven or eight thousand, to make up a suitable price for the\r\nestate? And what if there should be an outcry, and instead of that\r\nimposing picture it should come to a lawsuit? Something told Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch that the sensitive Petrusha would not relinquish anything\r\nthat was to his interest.","\"Why is it--as I've noticed,\" Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch whispered to me once, \"why is it that all these desperate\r\nsocialists and communists are at the same time such incredible\r\nskinflints, so avaricious, so keen over property, and, in fact, the\r\nmore socialistic, the more extreme they are, the keener they are over\r\nproperty... why is it? Can that, too, come from sentimentalism?\" I\r\ndon't know whether there is any truth in this observation of Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch's.","I only know that Petrusha had somehow got wind of the\r\nsale of the woods and the rest of it, and that Stepan Trofimovitch was\r\naware of the fact. I happened, too, to read some of Petrusha's letters\r\nto his father. He wrote extremely rarely, once a year, or even less\r\noften. Only recently, to inform him of his approaching visit, he had\r\nsent two letters, one almost immediately after the other. All his\r\nletters were short, dry, consisting only of instructions, and as the\r\nfather and son had, since their meeting in Petersburg, adopted the\r\nfashionable \"thou\" and \"thee,\" Petrusha's letters had a striking\r\nresemblance to the missives that used to be sent by landowners of the\r\nold school from the town to their serfs whom they had left in charge of\r\ntheir estates.","And now suddenly this eight thousand which would solve\r\nthe difficulty would be wafted to him by Varvara Petrovna's proposition.\r\nAnd at the same time she made him distinctly feel that it never could\r\nbe wafted to him from anywhere else. Of course Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nconsented.\r\n\r\nHe sent for me directly she had gone and shut himself up for the whole\r\nday, admitting no one else. He cried, of course, talked well and talked\r\na great deal, contradicted himself continually, made a casual pun, and\r\nwas much pleased with it.","Then he had a slight attack of his \"summer\r\ncholera\"--everything in fact followed the usual course. Then he brought\r\nout the portrait of his German bride, now twenty years deceased, and\r\nbegan plaintively appealing to her: \"Will you forgive me?\" In fact he\r\nseemed somehow distracted. Our grief led us to get a little drunk. He\r\nsoon fell into a sweet sleep, however. Next morning he tied his cravat\r\nin masterly fashion, dressed with care, and went frequently to look at\r\nhimself in the glass.","He sprinkled his handkerchief with scent, only a\r\nslight dash of it, however, and as soon as he saw Varvara Petrovna out\r\nof the window he hurriedly took another handkerchief and hid the scented\r\none under the pillow.\r\n\r\n\"Excellent!\" Varvara Petrovna approved, on receiving his consent. \"In\r\nthe first place you show a fine decision, and secondly you've listened\r\nto the voice of reason, to which you generally pay so little heed in\r\nyour private affairs.","There's no need of haste, however,\" she added,\r\nscanning the knot of his white tie, \"for the present say nothing, and I\r\nwill say nothing. It will soon be your birthday; I will come to see you\r\nwith her. Give us tea in the evening, and please without wine or other\r\nrefreshments, but I'll arrange it all myself. Invite your friends, but\r\nwe'll make the list together. You can talk to her the day before, if\r\nnecessary.","And at your party we won't exactly announce it, or make an\r\nengagement of any sort, but only hint at it, and let people know without\r\nany sort of ceremony. And then the wedding a fortnight later, as far\r\nas possible without any fuss.... You two might even go away for a time\r\nafter the wedding, to Moscow, for instance. I'll go with you, too,\r\nperhaps... The chief thing is, keep quiet till then.\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch was surprised.","He tried to falter that he could\r\nnot do like that, that he must talk it over with his bride. But Varvara\r\nPetrovna flew at him in exasperation.\r\n\r\n\"What for? In the first place it may perhaps come to nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come to nothing!\" muttered the bridegroom, utterly dumbfoundered.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I'll see.... But everything shall be as I've told you, and don't\r\nbe uneasy. I'll prepare her myself. There's really no need for you.","Everything necessary shall be said and done, and there's no need for you\r\nto meddle. Why should you? In what character? Don't come and don't write\r\nletters. And not a sight or sound of you, I beg. I will be silent too.\"\r\n\r\nShe absolutely refused to explain herself, and went away, obviously\r\nupset. Stepan Trofimovitch's excessive readiness evidently impressed\r\nher. Alas! he was utterly unable to grasp his position, and the question\r\nhad not yet presented itself to him from certain other points of view.","On the contrary a new note was apparent in him, a sort of conquering and\r\njaunty air. He swaggered.\r\n\r\n\"I do like that!\" he exclaimed, standing before me, and flinging wide\r\nhis arms. \"Did you hear? She wants to drive me to refusing at last. Why,\r\nI may lose patience, too, and... refuse! 'Sit still, there's no need\r\nfor you to go to her.' But after all, why should I be married? Simply\r\nbecause she's taken an absurd fancy into her heart.","But I'm a serious\r\nman, and I can refuse to submit to the idle whims of a giddy-woman! I\r\nhave duties to my son and...and to myself! I'm making a sacrifice. Does\r\nshe realise that? I have agreed, perhaps, because I am weary of life\r\nand nothing matters to me. But she may exasperate me, and then it will\r\nmatter. I shall resent it and refuse. _Et enfin, le ridicule_...what will\r\nthey say at the club? What will.",".. what will... Laputin say? 'Perhaps\r\nnothing will come of it'--what a thing to say! That beats everything.\r\nThat's really... what is one to say to that?... _Je suis un for√ßat, un\r\nBadinguet, un_ man pushed to the wall....\"\r\n\r\nAnd at the same time a sort of capricious complacency, something\r\nfrivolous and playful, could be seen in the midst of all these plaintive\r\nexclamations. In the evening we drank too much again.","CHAPTER III. THE SINS OF OTHERS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nABOUT A WEEK had passed, and the position had begun to grow more\r\ncomplicated.\r\n\r\nI may mention in passing that I suffered a great deal during that\r\nunhappy week, as I scarcely left the side of my affianced friend, in the\r\ncapacity of his most intimate confidant. What weighed upon him most\r\nwas the feeling of shame, though we saw no one all that week, and sat\r\nindoors alone.","But he was even ashamed before me, and so much so that\r\nthe more he confided to me the more vexed he was with me for it. He was\r\nso morbidly apprehensive that he expected that every one knew about it\r\nalready, the whole town, and was afraid to show himself, not only at the\r\nclub, but even in his circle of friends. He positively would not go out\r\nto take his constitutional till well after dusk, when it was quite dark.","A week passed and he still did not know whether he were betrothed or\r\nnot, and could not find out for a fact, however much he tried. He had\r\nnot yet seen his future bride, and did not know whether she was to be\r\nhis bride or not; did not, in fact, know whether there was anything\r\nserious in it at all. Varvara Petrovna, for some reason, resolutely\r\nrefused to admit him to her presence. In answer to one of his first\r\nletters to her (and he wrote a great number of them) she begged him\r\nplainly to spare her all communications with him for a time, because\r\nshe was very busy, and having a great deal of the utmost importance to\r\ncommunicate to him she was waiting for a more free moment to do so, and\r\nthat she would let him know _in time_ when he could come to see her.","She\r\ndeclared she would send back his letters unopened, as they were \"simple\r\nself-indulgence.\" I read that letter myself--he showed it me.\r\n\r\nYet all this harshness and indefiniteness were nothing compared with\r\nhis chief anxiety. That anxiety tormented him to the utmost and without\r\nceasing. He grew thin and dispirited through it. It was something of\r\nwhich he was more ashamed than of anything else, and of which he would\r\nnot on any account speak, even to me; on the contrary, he lied on\r\noccasion, and shuffled before me like a little boy; and at the same time\r\nhe sent for me himself every day, could not stay two hours without me,\r\nneeding me as much as air or water.","Such conduct rather wounded my vanity. I need hardly say that I had\r\nlong ago privately guessed this great secret of his, and saw through it\r\ncompletely. It was my firmest conviction at the time that the revelation\r\nof this secret, this chief anxiety of Stepan Trofimovitch's would not\r\nhave redounded to his credit, and, therefore, as I was still young, I\r\nwas rather indignant at the coarseness of his feelings and the ugliness\r\nof some of his suspicions.","In my warmth--and, I must confess, in my\r\nweariness of being his confidant--I perhaps blamed him too much. I was\r\nso cruel as to try and force him to confess it all to me himself, though\r\nI did recognise that it might be difficult to confess some things. He,\r\ntoo, saw through me; that is, he clearly perceived that I saw through\r\nhim, and that I was angry with him indeed, and he was angry with me\r\ntoo for being angry with him and seeing through him.","My irritation was\r\nperhaps petty and stupid; but the unrelieved solitude of two friends\r\ntogether is sometimes extremely prejudicial to true friendship. From a\r\ncertain point of view he had a very true understanding of some aspects\r\nof his position, and defined it, indeed, very subtly on those points\r\nabout which he did not think it necessary to be secret.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how different she was then!\" he would sometimes say to me about\r\nVarvara Petrovna.","\"How different she was in the old days when we used to\r\ntalk together.... Do you know that she could talk in those days! Can\r\nyou believe that she had ideas in those days, original ideas! Now,\r\neverything has changed! She says all that's only old-fashioned twaddle.\r\nShe despises the past.... Now she's like some shopman or cashier, she\r\nhas grown hard-hearted, and she's always cross....\"\r\n\r\n\"Why is she cross now if you are carrying out her orders?\" I answered.","He looked at me subtly.\r\n\r\n\"_Cher ami_; if I had not agreed she would have been dreadfully angry,\r\ndread-ful-ly! But yet less than now that I have consented.\"\r\n\r\nHe was pleased with this saying of his, and we emptied a bottle between\r\nus that evening. But that was only for a moment, next day he was worse\r\nand more ill-humoured than ever.\r\n\r\nBut what I was most vexed with him for was that he could not bring\r\nhimself to call on the Drozdovs, as he should have done on their\r\narrival, to renew the acquaintance of which, so we heard they were\r\nthemselves desirous, since they kept asking about him.","It was a source\r\nof daily distress to him. He talked of Lizaveta Nikolaevna with an\r\necstasy which I was at a loss to understand. No doubt he remembered in\r\nher the child whom he had once loved. But besides that, he imagined for\r\nsome unknown reason that he would at once find in her company a solace\r\nfor his present misery, and even the solution of his more serious\r\ndoubts. He expected to meet in Lizaveta Nikolaevna an extraordinary\r\nbeing.","And yet he did not go to see her though he meant to do so every\r\nday. The worst of it was that I was desperately anxious to be presented\r\nto her and to make her acquaintance, and I could look to no one but\r\nStepan Trofimovitch to effect this. I was frequently meeting her, in the\r\nstreet of course, when she was out riding, wearing a riding-habit and\r\nmounted on a fine horse, and accompanied by her cousin, so-called, a\r\nhandsome officer, the nephew of the late General Drozdov--and these\r\nmeetings made an extraordinary impression on me at the time.","My\r\ninfatuation lasted only a moment, and I very soon afterwards recognised\r\nthe impossibility of my dreams myself--but though it was a fleeting\r\nimpression it was a very real one, and so it may well be imagined\r\nhow indignant I was at the time with my poor friend for keeping so\r\nobstinately secluded.\r\n\r\nAll the members of our circle had been officially informed from the\r\nbeginning that Stepan Trofimovitch would see nobody for a time, and\r\nbegged them to leave him quite alone.","He insisted on sending round a\r\ncircular notice to this effect, though I tried to dissuade him. I\r\nwent round to every one at his request and told everybody that Varvara\r\nPetrovna had given \"our old man\" (as we all used to call Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch among ourselves) a special job, to arrange in order some\r\ncorrespondence lasting over many years; that he had shut himself up to\r\ndo it and I was helping him.","Liputin was the only one I did not have\r\ntime to visit, and I kept putting it off--to tell the real truth I was\r\nafraid to go to him. I knew beforehand that he would not believe one\r\nword of my story, that he would certainly imagine that there was some\r\nsecret at the bottom of it, which they were trying to hide from him\r\nalone, and as soon as I left him he would set to work to make inquiries\r\nand gossip all over the town.","While I was picturing all this to myself\r\nI happened to run across him in the street. It turned out that he had\r\nheard all about it from our friends, whom I had only just informed. But,\r\nstrange to say, instead of being inquisitive and asking questions about\r\nStepan Trofimovitch, he interrupted me, when I began apologising for not\r\nhaving come to him before, and at once passed to other subjects. It is\r\ntrue that he had a great deal stored up to tell me.","He was in a state\r\nof great excitement, and was delighted to have got hold of me for a\r\nlistener. He began talking of the news of the town, of the arrival\r\nof the governor's wife, \"with new topics of conversation,\" of an\r\nopposition party already formed in the club, of how they were all in a\r\nhubbub over the new ideas, and how charmingly this suited him, and so\r\non. He talked for a quarter of an hour and so amusingly that I could not\r\ntear myself away.","Though I could not endure him, yet I must admit he had\r\nthe gift of making one listen to him, especially when he was very angry\r\nat something. This man was, in my opinion, a regular spy from his very\r\nnature. At every moment he knew the very latest gossip and all the\r\ntrifling incidents of our town, especially the unpleasant ones, and it\r\nwas surprising to me how he took things to heart that were sometimes\r\nabsolutely no concern of his.","It always seemed to me that the leading\r\nfeature of his character was envy. When I told Stepan Trofimovitch the\r\nsame evening of my meeting Liputin that morning and our conversation,\r\nthe latter to my amazement became greatly agitated, and asked me the\r\nwild question: \"Does Liputin know or not?\"\r\n\r\nI began trying to prove that there was no possibility of his finding it\r\nout so soon, and that there was nobody from whom he could hear it.","But\r\nStepan Trofimovitch was not to be shaken. \"Well, you may believe it or\r\nnot,\" he concluded unexpectedly at last, \"but I'm convinced that he not\r\nonly knows every detail of 'our' position, but that he knows something\r\nelse besides, something neither you nor I know yet, and perhaps never\r\nshall, or shall only know when it's too late, when there's no turning\r\nback!...\"\r\n\r\nI said nothing, but these words suggested a great deal.","For five whole\r\ndays after that we did not say one word about Liputin; it was clear to\r\nme that Stepan Trofimovitch greatly regretted having let his tongue run\r\naway with him, and having revealed such suspicions before me.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nOne morning, on the seventh or eighth day after Stepan Trofimovitch had\r\nconsented to become \"engaged,\" about eleven o'clock, when I was hurrying\r\nas usual to my afflicted friend, I had an adventure on the way.","I met Karmazinov, \"the great writer,\" as Liputin called him. I had read\r\nKarmazinov from a child. His novels and tales were well known to the\r\npast and even to the present generation. I revelled in them; they were\r\nthe great enjoyment of my childhood and youth. Afterwards I grew rather\r\nless enthusiastic over his work. I did not care so much for the novels\r\nwith a purpose which he had been writing of late as for his first,\r\nearly works, which were so full of spontaneous poetry, and his latest\r\npublications I had not liked at all.","Speaking generally, if I may\r\nventure to express my opinion on so delicate a subject, all these\r\ntalented gentlemen of the middling sort who are sometimes in their\r\nlifetime accepted almost as geniuses, pass out of memory quite suddenly\r\nand without a trace when they die, and what's more, it often happens\r\nthat even during their lifetime, as soon as a new generation grows up\r\nand takes the place of the one in which they have flourished, they are\r\nforgotten and neglected by every one in an incredibly short time.","This\r\nsomehow happens among us quite suddenly, like the shifting of the scenes\r\non the stage. Oh, it's not at all the same as with Pushkin, Gogol,\r\nMoli√®re, Voltaire, all those great men who really had a new original\r\nword to say! It's true, too, that these talented gentlemen of the\r\nmiddling sort in the decline of their venerable years usually write\r\nthemselves out in the most pitiful way, though they don't observe the\r\nfact themselves.","It happens not infrequently that a writer who has been\r\nfor a long time credited with extraordinary profundity and expected\r\nto exercise a great and serious influence on the progress of society,\r\nbetrays in the end such poverty, such insipidity in his fundamental\r\nideas that no one regrets that he succeeded in writing himself out so\r\nsoon. But the old grey-beards don't notice this, and are angry. Their\r\nvanity sometimes, especially towards the end of their career, reaches\r\nproportions that may well provoke wonder.","God knows what they begin\r\nto take themselves for--for gods at least! People used to say about\r\nKarmazinov that his connections with aristocratic society and powerful\r\npersonages were dearer to him than his own soul, people used to say that\r\non meeting you he would be cordial, that he would fascinate and enchant\r\nyou with his open-heartedness, especially if you were of use to him in\r\nsome way, and if you came to him with some preliminary recommendation.","But that before any stray prince, any stray countess, anyone that he\r\nwas afraid of, he would regard it as his sacred duty to forget your\r\nexistence with the most insulting carelessness, like a chip of wood,\r\nlike a fly, before you had even time to get out of his sight; he\r\nseriously considered this the best and most aristocratic style. In spite\r\nof the best of breeding and perfect knowledge of good manners he is,\r\nthey say, vain to such an hysterical pitch that he cannot conceal his\r\nirritability as an author even in those circles of society where little\r\ninterest is taken in literature.","If anyone were to surprise him by being\r\nindifferent, he would be morbidly chagrined, and try to revenge himself.\r\n\r\nA year before, I had read an article of his in a review, written with\r\nan immense affectation of na√Øve poetry, and psychology too. He described\r\nthe wreck of some steamer on the English coast, of which he had been\r\nthe witness, and how he had seen the drowning people saved, and the\r\ndead bodies brought ashore.","All this rather long and verbose article\r\nwas written solely with the object of self-display. One seemed to read\r\nbetween the lines: \"Concentrate yourselves on me. Behold what I was like\r\nat those moments. What are the sea, the storm, the rocks, the splinters\r\nof wrecked ships to you? I have described all that sufficiently to you\r\nwith my mighty pen. Why look at that drowned woman with the dead child\r\nin her dead arms? Look rather at me, see how I was unable to bear that\r\nsight and turned away from it.","Here I stood with my back to it; here\r\nI was horrified and could not bring myself to look; I blinked my\r\neyes--isn't that interesting?\" When I told Stepan Trofimovitch my\r\nopinion of Karmazinov's article he quite agreed with me.\r\n\r\nWhen rumours had reached us of late that Karmazinov was coming to the\r\nneighbourhood I was, of course, very eager to see him, and, if possible,\r\nto make his acquaintance.","I knew that this might be done through Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch, they had once been friends. And now I suddenly met him at\r\nthe cross-roads. I knew him at once. He had been pointed out to me two\r\nor three days before when he drove past with the governor's wife. He\r\nwas a short, stiff-looking old man, though not over fifty-five, with a\r\nrather red little face, with thick grey locks of hair clustering under\r\nhis chimney-pot hat, and curling round his clean little pink ears.","His clean little face was not altogether handsome with its thin, long,\r\ncrafty-looking lips, with its rather fleshy nose, and its sharp, shrewd\r\nlittle eyes. He was dressed somewhat shabbily in a sort of cape such as\r\nwould be worn in Switzerland or North Italy at that time of year. But,\r\nat any rate, all the minor details of his costume, the little studs,\r\nand collar, the buttons, the tortoise-shell lorgnette on a narrow black\r\nribbon, the signet-ring, were all such as are worn by persons of the\r\nmost irreproachable good form.","I am certain that in summer he must have\r\nworn light prunella shoes with mother-of-pearl buttons at the side.\r\nWhen we met he was standing still at the turning and looking about him,\r\nattentively. Noticing that I was looking at him with interest, he asked\r\nme in a sugary, though rather shrill voice:\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to ask, which is my nearest way to Bykovy Street?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Bykovy Street? Oh, that's here, close by,\" I cried in great\r\nexcitement.","\"Straight on along this street and the second turning to the\r\nleft.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very much obliged to you.\"\r\n\r\nA curse on that minute! I fancy I was shy, and looked cringing. He\r\ninstantly noticed all that, and of course realised it all at once; that\r\nis, realised that I knew who he was, that I had read him and revered\r\nhim from a child, and that I was shy and looked at him cringingly. He\r\nsmiled, nodded again, and walked on as I had directed him.","I don't know\r\nwhy I turned back to follow him; I don't know why I ran for ten paces\r\nbeside him. He suddenly stood still again.\r\n\r\n\"And could you tell me where is the nearest cab-stand?\" he shouted out\r\nto me again.\r\n\r\nIt was a horrid shout! A horrid voice!\r\n\r\n\"A cab-stand? The nearest cab-stand is... by the Cathedral; there are\r\nalways cabs standing there,\" and I almost turned to run for a cab for\r\nhim.","I almost believe that that was what he expected me to do. Of\r\ncourse I checked myself at once, and stood still, but he had noticed\r\nmy movement and was still watching me with the same horrid smile. Then\r\nsomething happened which I shall never forget.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly dropped a tiny bag, which he was holding in his left\r\nhand; though indeed it was not a bag, but rather a little box, or more\r\nprobably some part of a pocket-book, or to be more accurate a little\r\nreticule, rather like an old-fashioned lady's reticule, though I really\r\ndon't know what it was.","I only know that I flew to pick it up.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that I did not really pick it up, but my first motion\r\nwas unmistakable. I could not conceal it, and, like a fool, I turned\r\ncrimson. The cunning fellow at once got all that could be got out of the\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\n\"Don't trouble, I'll pick it up,\" he pronounced charmingly; that is,\r\nwhen he was quite sure that I was not going to pick up the reticule, he\r\npicked it up as though forestalling me, nodded once more, and went his\r\nway, leaving me to look like a fool.","It was as good as though I had\r\npicked it up myself. For five minutes I considered myself utterly\r\ndisgraced forever, but as I reached Stepan Trofimovitch's house I\r\nsuddenly burst out laughing; the meeting struck me as so amusing that I\r\nimmediately resolved to entertain Stepan Trofimovitch with an account of\r\nit, and even to act the whole scene to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nBut this time to my surprise I found an extraordinary change in him.","He\r\npounced on me with a sort of avidity, it is true, as soon as I went in,\r\nand began listening to me, but with such a distracted air that at first\r\nhe evidently did not take in my words. But as soon as I pronounced the\r\nname of Karmazinov he suddenly flew into a frenzy.\r\n\r\n\"Don't speak of him! Don't pronounce that name!\" he exclaimed, almost in\r\na fury. \"Here, look, read it! Read it!\"\r\n\r\nHe opened the drawer and threw on the table three small sheets of paper,\r\ncovered with a hurried pencil scrawl, all from Varvara Petrovna.","The\r\nfirst letter was dated the day before yesterday, the second had come\r\nyesterday, and the last that day, an hour before. Their contents were\r\nquite trivial, and all referred to Karmazinov and betrayed the vain\r\nand fussy uneasiness of Varvara Petrovna and her apprehension that\r\nKarmazinov might forget to pay her a visit. Here is the first one dating\r\nfrom two days before. (Probably there had been one also three days\r\nbefore, and possibly another four days before as well.",")\r\n\r\n\"If he deigns to visit you to-day, not a word about me, I beg. Not the\r\nfaintest hint. Don't speak of me, don't mention me.--V. S.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter of the day before:\r\n\r\n\"If he decides to pay you a visit this morning, I think the most\r\ndignified thing would be not to receive him. That's what I think about\r\nit; I don't know what you think.--V. S.\"\r\n\r\nTo-day's, the last:\r\n\r\n\"I feel sure that you're in a regular litter and clouds of tobacco\r\nsmoke.","I'm sending you Marya and Fomushka. They'll tidy you up in half\r\nan hour. And don't hinder them, but go and sit in the kitchen while they\r\nclear up. I'm sending you a Bokhara rug and two china vases. I've long\r\nbeen meaning to make you a present of them, and I'm sending you my\r\nTeniers, too, for a time! You can put the vases in the window and hang\r\nthe Teniers on the right under the portrait of Goethe; it will be more\r\nconspicuous there and it's always light there in the morning.","If he does\r\nturn up at last, receive him with the utmost courtesy but try and talk\r\nof trifling matters, of some intellectual subject, and behave as though\r\nyou had seen each other lately. Not a word about me. Perhaps I may look\r\nin on you in the evening.--V. S.\r\n\r\n\"P.S.--If he does not come to-day he won't come at all.\"\r\n\r\nI read and was amazed that he was in such excitement over such trifles.\r\nLooking at him inquiringly, I noticed that he had had time while I was\r\nreading to change the everlasting white tie he always wore, for a red\r\none.","His hat and stick lay on the table. He was pale, and his hands were\r\npositively trembling.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care a hang about her anxieties,\" he cried frantically, in\r\nresponse to my inquiring look. \"_Je m'en fiche!_ She has the face to be\r\nexcited about Karmazinov, and she does not answer my letters. Here is\r\nmy unopened letter which she sent me back yesterday, here on the table\r\nunder the book, under _L'Homme qui rit_.","What is it to me that she's\r\nwearing herself out over Nikolay! _Je m'en fiche, et je proclame ma\r\nlibert√©! Au diable le Karmazinov! Au diable la Lembke!_ I've hidden the\r\nvases in the entry, and the Teniers in the chest of drawers, and I have\r\ndemanded that she is to see me at once. Do you hear. I've insisted!\r\nI've sent her just such a scrap of paper, a pencil scrawl, unsealed, by\r\nNastasya, and I'm waiting.","I want Darya Pavlovna to speak to me with\r\nher own lips, before the face of Heaven, or at least before you. _Vous me\r\nseconderez, n'est-ce pas, comme ami et t√©moin._ I don't want to have\r\nto blush, to lie, I don't want secrets, I won't have secrets in this\r\nmatter. Let them confess everything to me openly, frankly, honourably\r\nand then... then perhaps I may surprise the whole generation by my\r\nmagnanimity.","... Am I a scoundrel or not, my dear sir?\" he concluded\r\nsuddenly, looking menacingly at me, as though I'd considered him a\r\nscoundrel.\r\n\r\nI offered him a sip of water; I had never seen him like this before. All\r\nthe while he was talking he kept running from one end of the room to\r\nthe other, but he suddenly stood still before me in an extraordinary\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\n\"Can you suppose,\" he began again with hysterical haughtiness, looking\r\nme up and down, \"can you imagine that I, Stepan Verhovensky, cannot find\r\nin myself the moral strength to take my bag--my beggar's bag--and laying\r\nit on my feeble shoulders to go out at the gate and vanish forever,\r\nwhen honour and the great principle of independence demand it! It's\r\nnot the first time that Stepan Verhovensky has had to repel despotism by\r\nmoral force, even though it be the despotism of a crazy woman, that\r\nis, the most cruel and insulting despotism which can exist on earth,\r\nalthough you have, I fancy, forgotten yourself so much as to laugh at\r\nmy phrase, my dear sir! Oh, you don't believe that I can find the moral\r\nstrength in myself to end my life as a tutor in a merchant's family, or\r\nto die of hunger in a ditch! Answer me, answer at once; do you believe\r\nit, or don't you believe it?\"\r\n\r\nBut I was purposely silent.","I even affected to hesitate to wound him by\r\nanswering in the negative, but to be unable to answer affirmatively. In\r\nall this nervous excitement of his there was something which really did\r\noffend me, and not personally, oh, no! But... I will explain later on.\r\nHe positively turned pale.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you are bored with me, G----v (this is my surname), and you\r\nwould like... not to come and see me at all?\" he said in that tone of\r\npale composure which usually precedes some extraordinary outburst.","I\r\njumped up in alarm. At that moment Nastasya came in, and, without a\r\nword, handed Stepan Trofimovitch a piece of paper, on which something\r\nwas written in pencil. He glanced at it and flung it to me. On the\r\npaper, in Varvara Petrovna's hand three words were written: \"Stay at\r\nhome.\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch snatched up his hat and stick in silence and went\r\nquickly out of the room. Mechanically I followed him.","Suddenly voices\r\nand sounds of rapid footsteps were heard in the passage. He stood still,\r\nas though thunder-struck.\r\n\r\n\"It's Liputin; I am lost!\" he whispered, clutching at my arm.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant Liputin walked into the room.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nWhy he should be lost owing to Liputin I did not know, and indeed I\r\ndid not attach much significance to the words; I put it all down to his\r\nnerves. His terror, however, was remarkable, and I made up my mind to\r\nkeep a careful watch on him.","The very appearance of Liputin as he came in assured us that he had on\r\nthis occasion a special right to come in, in spite of the prohibition.\r\nHe brought with him an unknown gentleman, who must have been a new\r\narrival in the town. In reply to the senseless stare of my petrified\r\nfriend, he called out immediately in a loud voice:\r\n\r\n\"I'm bringing you a visitor, a special one! I make bold to intrude on\r\nyour solitude.","Mr. Kirillov, a very distinguished civil engineer. And\r\nwhat's more he knows your son, the much esteemed Pyotr Stepanovitch,\r\nvery intimately; and he has a message from him. He's only just arrived.\"\r\n\r\n\"The message is your own addition,\" the visitor observed curtly.\r\n\"There's no message at all. But I certainly do know Verhovensky. I left\r\nhim in the X. province, ten days ahead of us.\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch mechanically offered his hand and motioned him to\r\nsit down.","He looked at me, he looked at Liputin, and then as though\r\nsuddenly recollecting himself sat down himself, though he still kept his\r\nhat and stick in his hands without being aware of it.\r\n\r\n\"Bah, but you were going out yourself! I was told that you were quite\r\nknocked up with work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm ill, and you see, I meant to go for a walk, I...\" Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch checked himself, quickly flung his hat and stick on the\r\nsofa and--turned crimson.","Meantime, I was hurriedly examining the visitor. He was a young man,\r\nabout twenty-seven, decently dressed, well made, slender and dark, with\r\na pale, rather muddy-coloured face and black lustreless eyes. He seemed\r\nrather thoughtful and absent-minded, spoke jerkily and ungrammatically,\r\ntransposing words in rather a strange way, and getting muddled if he\r\nattempted a sentence of any length. Liputin was perfectly aware of\r\nStepan Trofimovitch's alarm, and was obviously pleased at it.","He sat\r\ndown in a wicker chair which he dragged almost into the middle of the\r\nroom, so as to be at an equal distance between his host and the visitor,\r\nwho had installed themselves on sofas on opposite sides of the room. His\r\nsharp eyes darted inquisitively from one corner of the room to another.\r\n\r\n\"It's.... a long while since I've seen Petrusha.... You met abroad?\"\r\nStepan Trofimovitch managed to mutter to the visitor.","\"Both here and abroad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alexey Nilitch has only just returned himself after living four years\r\nabroad,\" put in Liputin. \"He has been travelling to perfect himself in\r\nhis speciality and has come to us because he has good reasons to expect\r\na job on the building of our railway bridge, and he's now waiting for an\r\nanswer about it. He knows the Drozdovs and Lizaveta Nikolaevna, through\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch.","\"\r\n\r\nThe engineer sat, as it were, with a ruffled air, and listened with\r\nawkward impatience. It seemed to me that he was angry about something.\r\n\r\n\"He knows Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch?\" inquired Stepan Trofimovitch.\r\n\r\n\"I know him too.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's... it's a very long time since I've seen Petrusha, and... I feel\r\nI have so little right to call myself a father.",".. _c'est le mot;_ I... how\r\ndid you leave him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I left him... he comes himself,\" replied Mr. Kirillov, in\r\nhaste to be rid of the question again. He certainly was angry.\r\n\r\n\"He's coming! At last I... you see, it's very long since I've seen\r\nPetrusha!\" Stepan Trofimovitch could not get away from this phrase. \"Now\r\nI expect my poor boy to whom... to whom I have been so much to blame!\r\nThat is, I mean to say, when I left him in Petersburg, I.",".. in short, I\r\nlooked on him as a nonentity, _quelque chose dans ce genre._ He was a very\r\nnervous boy, you know, emotional, and... very timid. When he said his\r\nprayers going to bed he used to bow down to the ground, and make the\r\nsign of the cross on his pillow that he might not die in the night....\r\n_Je m'en souviens. Enfin,_ no artistic feeling whatever, not a sign of\r\nanything higher, of anything fundamental, no embryo of a future\r\nideal.",".._c'√©tait comme un petit idiot,_ but I'm afraid I am incoherent;\r\nexcuse me... you came upon me...\"\r\n\r\n\"You say seriously that he crossed his pillow?\" the engineer asked\r\nsuddenly with marked curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he used to...\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. I just asked. Go on.\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch looked interrogatively at Liputin.\r\n\r\n\"I'm very grateful to you for your visit. But I must confess I'm...\r\nnot in a condition.",".. just now... But allow me to ask where you are\r\nlodging.\"\r\n\r\n\"At Filipov's, in Bogoyavlensky Street.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ach, that's where Shatov lives,\" I observed involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\"Just so, in the very same house,\" cried Liputin, \"only Shatov lodges\r\nabove, in the attic, while he's down below, at Captain Lebyadkin's. He\r\nknows Shatov too, and he knows Shatov's wife. He was very intimate with\r\nher, abroad.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Comment!_ Do you really know anything about that unhappy marriage _de ce\r\npauvre ami_ and that woman,\" cried Stepan Trofimovitch, carried away\r\nby sudden feeling.","\"You are the first man I've met who has known her\r\npersonally; and if only...\"\r\n\r\n\"What nonsense!\" the engineer snapped out, flushing all over. \"How you\r\nadd to things, Liputin! I've not seen Shatov's wife; I've only once seen\r\nher in the distance and not at all close.... I know Shatov. Why do you\r\nadd things of all sorts?\"\r\n\r\nHe turned round sharply on the sofa, clutched his hat, then laid it down\r\nagain, and settling himself down once more as before, fixed his angry\r\nblack eyes on Stepan Trofimovitch with a sort of defiance.","I was at a\r\nloss to understand such strange irritability.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Stepan Trofimovitch observed impressively. \"I understand\r\nthat it may be a very delicate subject....\"\r\n\r\n\"No sort of delicate subject in it, and indeed it's shameful, and I\r\ndidn't shout at you that it's nonsense, but at Liputin, because he adds\r\nthings. Excuse me if you took it to yourself. I know Shatov, but I don't\r\nknow his wife at all.",".. I don't know her at all!\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand. I understand. And if I insisted, it's only because I'm\r\nvery fond of our poor friend, _notre irascible ami_, and have always\r\ntaken an interest in him.... In my opinion that man changed his former,\r\npossibly over-youthful but yet sound ideas, too abruptly. And now he\r\nsays all sorts of things about _notre Sainte Russie_ to such a degree that\r\nI've long explained this upheaval in his whole constitution, I can only\r\ncall it that, to some violent shock in his family life, and, in fact, to\r\nhis unsuccessful marriage.","I, who know my poor Russia like the fingers\r\non my hand, and have devoted my whole life to the Russian people, I can\r\nassure you that he does not know the Russian people, and what's more...\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know the Russian people at all, either, and I haven't time to\r\nstudy them,\" the engineer snapped out again, and again he turned sharply\r\non the sofa. Stepan Trofimovitch was pulled up in the middle of his\r\nspeech.","\"He is studying them, he is studying them,\" interposed Liputin. \"He\r\nhas already begun the study of them, and is writing a very interesting\r\narticle dealing with the causes of the increase of suicide in Russia,\r\nand, generally speaking, the causes that lead to the increase or\r\ndecrease of suicide in society. He has reached amazing results.\"\r\n\r\nThe engineer became dreadfully excited. \"You have no right at all,\" he\r\nmuttered wrathfully.","\"I'm not writing an article. I'm not going to do\r\nsilly things. I asked you confidentially, quite by chance. There's\r\nno article at all. I'm not publishing, and you haven't the right...\"\r\nLiputin was obviously enjoying himself.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, perhaps I made a mistake in calling your literary\r\nwork an article. He is only collecting observations, and the essence of\r\nthe question, or, so to say, its moral aspect he is not touching at all.","And, indeed, he rejects morality itself altogether, and holds with the\r\nlast new principle of general destruction for the sake of ultimate\r\ngood. He demands already more than a hundred million heads for the\r\nestablishment of common sense in Europe; many more than they demanded at\r\nthe last Peace Congress. Alexey Nilitch goes further than anyone in that\r\nsense.\" The engineer listened with a pale and contemptuous smile.","For\r\nhalf a minute every one was silent.\r\n\r\n\"All this is stupid, Liputin,\" Mr. Kirillov observed at last, with a\r\ncertain dignity. \"If I by chance had said some things to you, and you\r\ncaught them up again, as you like. But you have no right, for I never\r\nspeak to anyone. I scorn to talk.... If one has a conviction then it's\r\nclear to me.... But you're doing foolishly. I don't argue about things\r\nwhen everything's settled.","I can't bear arguing. I never want to\r\nargue....\"\r\n\r\n\"And perhaps you are very wise,\" Stepan Trofimovitch could not resist\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\n\"I apologise to you, but I am not angry with anyone here,\" the visitor\r\nwent on, speaking hotly and rapidly. \"I have seen few people for four\r\nyears. For four years I have talked little and have tried to see no one,\r\nfor my own objects which do not concern anyone else, for four years.","Liputin found this out and is laughing. I understand and don't mind. I'm\r\nnot ready to take offence, only annoyed at his liberty. And if I don't\r\nexplain my ideas to you,\" he concluded unexpectedly, scanning us all\r\nwith resolute eyes, \"it's not at all that I'm afraid of your giving\r\ninformation to the government; that's not so; please do not imagine\r\nnonsense of that sort.\"\r\n\r\nNo one made any reply to these words.","We only looked at each other. Even\r\nLiputin forgot to snigger.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, I'm very sorry\"--Stepan Trofimovitch got up resolutely from\r\nthe sofa--\"but I feel ill and upset. Excuse me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ach, that's for us to go.\" Mr. Kirillov started, snatching up his cap.\r\n\"It's a good thing you told us. I'm so forgetful.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose, and with a good-natured air went up to Stepan Trofimovitch,\r\nholding out his hand.","\"I'm sorry you're not well, and I came.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you every success among us,\" answered Stepan Trofimovitch,\r\nshaking hands with him heartily and without haste. \"I understand that,\r\nif as you say you have lived so long abroad, cutting yourself off\r\nfrom people for objects of your own and forgetting Russia, you must\r\ninevitably look with wonder on us who are Russians to the backbone, and\r\nwe must feel the same about you.","_Mais cela passera._ I'm only puzzled at\r\none thing: you want to build our bridge and at the same time you declare\r\nthat you hold with the principle of universal destruction. They won't\r\nlet you build our bridge.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! What's that you said? Ach, I say!\" Kirillov cried, much struck,\r\nand he suddenly broke into the most frank and good-humoured laughter.\r\nFor a moment his face took a quite childlike expression, which I thought\r\nsuited him particularly.","Liputin rubbed his hand with delight at Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch's witty remark. I kept wondering to myself why Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch was so frightened of Liputin, and why he had cried out \"I\r\nam lost\" when he heard him coming.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nWe were all standing in the doorway. It was the moment when hosts and\r\nguests hurriedly exchange the last and most cordial words, and then\r\npart to their mutual gratification.","\"The reason he's so cross to-day,\" Liputin dropped all at once, as it\r\nwere casually, when he was just going out of the room, \"is because he\r\nhad a disturbance to-day with Captain Lebyadkin over his sister. Captain\r\nLebyadkin thrashes that precious sister of his, the mad girl, every day\r\nwith a whip, a real Cossack whip, every morning and evening. So Alexey\r\nNilitch has positively taken the lodge so as not to be present.","Well,\r\ngood-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"A sister? An invalid? With a whip?\" Stepan Trofimovitch cried out, as\r\nthough he had suddenly been lashed with a whip himself. \"What sister?\r\nWhat Lebyadkin?\" All his former terror came back in an instant.\r\n\r\n\"Lebyadkin! Oh, that's the retired captain; he used only to call himself\r\na lieutenant before....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what is his rank to me? What sister? Good heavens!... You say\r\nLebyadkin? But there used to be a Lebyadkin here.","...\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the very man. 'Our' Lebyadkin, at Virginsky's, you remember?\"\r\n\r\n\"But he was caught with forged papers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now he's come back. He's been here almost three weeks and under\r\nthe most peculiar circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, but he's a scoundrel?\"\r\n\r\n\"As though no one could be a scoundrel among us,\" Liputin grinned\r\nsuddenly, his knavish little eyes seeming to peer into Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch's soul.","\"Good heavens! I didn't mean that at all... though I quite agree with\r\nyou about that, with you particularly. But what then, what then? What\r\ndid you mean by that? You certainly meant something by that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's all so trivial.... This captain to all appearances went away\r\nfrom us at that time; not because of the forged papers, but simply to\r\nlook for his sister, who was in hiding from him somewhere, it seems;\r\nwell, and now he's brought her and that's the whole story.","Why do you\r\nseem frightened, Stepan Trofimovitch? I only tell this from his drunken\r\nchatter though, he doesn't speak of it himself when he's sober. He's an\r\nirritable man, and, so to speak, √¶sthetic in a military style; only he\r\nhas bad taste. And this sister is lame as well as mad. She seems to\r\nhave been seduced by someone, and Mr. Lebyadkin has, it seems, for many\r\nyears received a yearly grant from the seducer by way of compensation\r\nfor the wound to his honour, so it would seem at least from his chatter,\r\nthough I believe it's only drunken talk.","It's simply his brag. Besides,\r\nthat sort of thing is done much cheaper. But that he has a sum of money\r\nis perfectly certain. Ten days ago he was walking barefoot, and now I've\r\nseen hundreds in his hands. His sister has fits of some sort every day,\r\nshe shrieks and he 'keeps her in order' with the whip. You must inspire\r\na woman with respect, he says. What I can't understand is how Shatov\r\ngoes on living above him.","Alexey Nilitch has only been three days with\r\nthem. They were acquainted in Petersburg, and now he's taken the lodge\r\nto get away from the disturbance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this all true?\" said Stepan Trofimovitch, addressing the engineer.\r\n\r\n\"You do gossip a lot, Liputin,\" the latter muttered wrathfully.\r\n\r\n\"Mysteries, secrets! Where have all these mysteries and secrets among us\r\nsprung from?\" Stepan Trofimovitch could not refrain from exclaiming.","The engineer frowned, flushed red, shrugged his shoulders and went out\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\n\"Alexey Nilitch positively snatched the whip out of his hand, broke it\r\nand threw it out of the window, and they had a violent quarrel,\" added\r\nLiputin.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you chattering, Liputin; it's stupid. What for?\" Alexey Nilitch\r\nturned again instantly.\r\n\r\n\"Why be so modest and conceal the generous impulses of one's soul; that\r\nis, of your soul? I'm not speaking of my own.","\"\r\n\r\n\"How stupid it is... and quite unnecessary. Lebyadkin's stupid and quite\r\nworthless--and no use to the cause, and... utterly mischievous. Why do\r\nyou keep babbling all sorts of things? I'm going.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what a pity!\" cried Liputin with a candid smile, \"or I'd have\r\namused you with another little story, Stepan Trofimovitch. I came,\r\nindeed, on purpose to tell you, though I dare say you've heard it\r\nalready.","Well, till another time, Alexey Nilitch is in such a hurry.\r\nGood-bye for the present. The story concerns Varvara Petrovna. She\r\namused me the day before yesterday; she sent for me on purpose. It's\r\nsimply killing. Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nBut at this Stepan Trofimovitch absolutely would not let him go. He\r\nseized him by the shoulders, turned him sharply back into the room, and\r\nsat him down in a chair. Liputin was positively scared.","\"Why, to be sure,\" he began, looking warily at Stepan Trofimovitch from\r\nhis chair, \"she suddenly sent for me and asked me 'confidentially' my\r\nprivate opinion, whether Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch is mad or in his right\r\nmind. Isn't that astonishing?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're out of your mind!\" muttered Stepan Trofimovitch, and suddenly,\r\nas though he were beside himself: \"Liputin, you know perfectly well that\r\nyou only came here to tell me something insulting of that sort and.","..\r\nsomething worse!\"\r\n\r\nIn a flash, I recalled his conjecture that Liputin knew not only more\r\nthan we did about our affair, but something else which we should never\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word, Stepan Trofimovitch,\" muttered Liputin, seeming greatly\r\nalarmed, \"upon my word...\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue and begin! I beg you, Mr. Kirillov, to come back too,\r\nand be present. I earnestly beg you! Sit down, and you, Liputin, begin\r\ndirectly, simply and without any excuses.","\"\r\n\r\n\"If I had only known it would upset you so much I wouldn't have begun at\r\nall. And of course I thought you knew all about it from Varvara Petrovna\r\nherself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't think that at all. Begin, begin, I tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only do me the favour to sit down yourself, or how can I sit here\r\nwhen you are running about before me in such excitement. I can't speak\r\ncoherently.\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch restrained himself and sank impressively into an\r\neasy chair.","The engineer stared gloomily at the floor. Liputin looked at\r\nthem with intense enjoyment,\r\n\r\n\"How am I to begin?... I'm too overwhelmed....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\"The day before yesterday a servant was suddenly sent to me: 'You are\r\nasked to call at twelve o'clock,' said he. Can you fancy such a thing? I\r\nthrew aside my work, and precisely at midday yesterday I was ringing at\r\nthe bell. I was let into the drawing room; I waited a minute--she came\r\nin; she made me sit down and sat down herself, opposite.","I sat down, and\r\nI couldn't believe it; you know how she has always treated me. She\r\nbegan at once without beating about the bush, you know her way. 'You\r\nremember,' she said, 'that four years ago when Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch\r\nwas ill he did some strange things which made all the town wonder\r\ntill the position was explained. One of those actions concerned you\r\npersonally. When Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch recovered he went at my request\r\nto call on you.","I know that he talked to you several times before, too.\r\nTell me openly and candidly what you... (she faltered a little at this\r\npoint) what you thought of Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch then... what was your\r\nview of him altogether... what idea you were able to form of him at that\r\ntime... and still have?'\r\n\r\n\"Here she was completely confused, so that she paused for a whole\r\nminute, and suddenly flushed.","I was alarmed. She began again--touchingly\r\nis not quite the word, it's not applicable to her--but in a very\r\nimpressive tone:\r\n\r\n\"'I want you,' she said, 'to understand me clearly and without mistake.\r\nI've sent for you now because I look upon you as a keen-sighted and\r\nquick-witted man, qualified to make accurate observations.' (What\r\ncompliments!) 'You'll understand too,' she said, 'that I am a mother\r\nappealing to you.","... Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch has suffered some\r\ncalamities and has passed through many changes of fortune in his life.\r\nAll that,' she said, 'might well have affected the state of his mind.\r\nI'm not speaking of madness, of course,' she said, 'that's quite out\r\nof the question!' (This was uttered proudly and resolutely.) 'But there\r\nmight be something strange, something peculiar, some turn of thought, a\r\ntendency to some particular way of looking at things.","' (Those were her\r\nexact words, and I admired, Stepan Trofimovitch, the exactness with\r\nwhich Varvara Petrovna can put things. She's a lady of superior\r\nintellect!) 'I have noticed in him, anyway,' she said, 'a perpetual\r\nrestlessness and a tendency to peculiar impulses. But I am a mother\r\nand you are an impartial spectator, and therefore qualified with your\r\nintelligence to form a more impartial opinion.","I implore you, in fact'\r\n(yes, that word, 'implore' was uttered!), 'to tell me the whole truth,\r\nwithout mincing matters. And if you will give me your word never to\r\nforget that I have spoken to you in confidence, you may reckon upon my\r\nalways being ready to seize every opportunity in the future to show my\r\ngratitude.' Well, what do you say to that?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have... so amazed me...\" faltered Stepan Trofimovitch, \"that I\r\ndon't believe you.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, observe, observe,\" cried Liputin, as though he had not heard\r\nStepan Trofimovitch, \"observe what must be her agitation and uneasiness\r\nif she stoops from her grandeur to appeal to a man like me, and even\r\ncondescends to beg me to keep it secret. What do you call that?\r\nHasn't she received some news of Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, something\r\nunexpected?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know... of news of any sort.",".. I haven't seen her for some\r\ndays, but... but I must say...\" lisped Stepan Trofimovitch, evidently\r\nhardly able to think clearly, \"but I must say, Liputin, that if it\r\nwas said to you in confidence, and here you're telling it before every\r\none...\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely in confidence! But God strike me dead if I... But as for\r\ntelling it here... what does it matter? Are we strangers, even Alexey\r\nNilitch?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't share that attitude.","No doubt we three here will keep the\r\nsecret, but I'm afraid of the fourth, you, and wouldn't trust you in\r\nanything....\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by that? Why it's more to my interest than anyone's,\r\nseeing I was promised eternal gratitude! What I wanted was to point\r\nout in this connection one extremely strange incident, rather to\r\nsay, psychological than simply strange. Yesterday evening, under the\r\ninfluence of my conversation with Varvara Petrovna--you can fancy\r\nyourself what an impression it made on me--I approached Alexey Nilitch\r\nwith a discreet question: 'You knew Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch abroad,'\r\nsaid I, 'and used to know him before in Petersburg too.","What do you\r\nthink of his mind and his abilities?' said I. He answered laconically,\r\nas his way is, that he was a man of subtle intellect and sound judgment.\r\n'And have you never noticed in the course of years,' said I, 'any\r\nturn of ideas or peculiar way of looking at things, or any, so to say,\r\ninsanity?' In fact, I repeated Varvara Petrovna's own question. And\r\nwould you believe it, Alexey Nilitch suddenly grew thoughtful, and\r\nscowled, just as he's doing now.","'Yes,' said he, 'I have sometimes\r\nthought there was something strange.' Take note, too, that if anything\r\ncould have seemed strange even to Alexey Nilitch, it must really have\r\nbeen something, mustn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that true?\" said Stepan Trofimovitch, turning to Alexey Nilitch.\r\n\r\n\"I should prefer not to speak of it,\" answered Alexey Nilitch, suddenly\r\nraising his head, and looking at him with flashing eyes.","\"I wish to\r\ncontest your right to do this, Liputin. You've no right to drag me into\r\nthis. I did not give my whole opinion at all. Though I knew Nikolay\r\nStavrogin in Petersburg that was long ago, and though I've met him since\r\nI know him very little. I beg you to leave me out and... All this is\r\nsomething like scandal.\"\r\n\r\nLiputin threw up his hands with an air of oppressed innocence.\r\n\r\n\"A scandal-monger! Why not say a spy while you're about it? It's all\r\nvery well for you, Alexey Nilitch, to criticise when you stand aloof\r\nfrom everything.","But you wouldn't believe it, Stepan Trofimovitch--take\r\nCaptain Lebyadkin, he is stupid enough, one may say... in fact, one's\r\nashamed to say how stupid he is; there is a Russian comparison, to\r\nsignify the degree of it; and do you know he considers himself injured\r\nby Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, though he is full of admiration for his wit.\r\n'I'm amazed,' said he, 'at that man. He's a subtle serpent.","' His own\r\nwords. And I said to him (still under the influence of my conversation,\r\nand after I had spoken to Alexey Nilitch), 'What do you think, captain,\r\nis your subtle serpent mad or not?' Would you believe it, it was just as\r\nif I'd given him a sudden lash from behind. He simply leapt up from his\r\nseat. 'Yes,' said he, '... yes, only that,' he said, 'cannot affect...'\r\n'Affect what?' He didn't finish.","Yes, and then he fell to thinking so\r\nbitterly, thinking so much, that his drunkenness dropped off him. We\r\nwere sitting in Filipov's restaurant. And it wasn't till half an hour\r\nlater that he suddenly struck the table with his fist. 'Yes,' said he,\r\n'maybe he's mad, but that can't affect it....' Again he didn't say what\r\nit couldn't affect. Of course I'm only giving you an extract of the\r\nconversation, but one can understand the sense of it.","You may ask whom\r\nyou like, they all have the same idea in their heads, though it never\r\nentered anyone's head before. 'Yes,' they say, 'he's mad; he's very\r\nclever, but perhaps he's mad too.'\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch sat pondering, and thought intently.\r\n\r\n\"And how does Lebyadkin know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mind inquiring about that of Alexey Nilitch, who has just called\r\nme a spy? I'm a spy, yet I don't know, but Alexey Nilitch knows all the\r\nins and outs of it, and holds his tongue.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing about it, or hardly anything,\" answered the engineer\r\nwith the same irritation. \"You make Lebyadkin drunk to find out. You\r\nbrought me here to find out and to make me say. And so you must be a\r\nspy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't made him drunk yet, and he's not worth the money either, with\r\nall his secrets. They are not worth that to me. I don't know what they\r\nare to you. On the contrary, he is scattering the money, though twelve\r\ndays ago he begged fifteen kopecks of me, and it's he treats me to\r\nchampagne, not I him.","But you've given me an idea, and if there should\r\nbe occasion I will make him drunk, just to get to the bottom of it and\r\nmaybe I shall find out... all your little secrets,\" Liputin snapped back\r\nspitefully.\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch looked in bewilderment at the two disputants. Both\r\nwere giving themselves away, and what's more, were not standing on\r\nceremony. The thought crossed my mind that Liputin had brought this\r\nAlexey Nilitch to us with the simple object of drawing him into a\r\nconversation through a third person for purposes of his own--his\r\nfavourite manoeuvre.","\"Alexey Nilitch knows Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch quite well,\" he went on,\r\nirritably, \"only he conceals it. And as to your question about Captain\r\nLebyadkin, he made his acquaintance before any of us did, six years ago\r\nin Petersburg, in that obscure, if one may so express it, epoch in the\r\nlife of Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, before he had dreamed of rejoicing our\r\nhearts by coming here. Our prince, one must conclude, surrounded himself\r\nwith rather a queer selection of acquaintances.","It was at that time, it\r\nseems, that he made acquaintance with this gentleman here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care, Liputin. I warn you, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch meant to be\r\nhere soon himself, and he knows how to defend himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why warn me? I am the first to cry out that he is a man of the most\r\nsubtle and refined intelligence, and I quite reassured Varvara Petrovna\r\nyesterday on that score. 'It's his character,' I said to her, 'that I\r\ncan't answer for.","' Lebyadkin said the same thing yesterday: 'A lot of\r\nharm has come to me from his character,' he said. Stepan Trofimovitch,\r\nit's all very well for you to cry out about slander and spying, and at\r\nthe very time observe that you wring it all out of me, and with such\r\nimmense curiosity too. Now, Varvara Petrovna went straight to the point\r\nyesterday. 'You have had a personal interest in the business,' she said,\r\n'that's why I appeal to you.","' I should say so! What need to look for\r\nmotives when I've swallowed a personal insult from his excellency before\r\nthe whole society of the place. I should think I have grounds to be\r\ninterested, not merely for the sake of gossip. He shakes hands with\r\nyou one day, and next day, for no earthly reason, he returns your\r\nhospitality by slapping you on the cheeks in the face of all decent\r\nsociety, if the fancy takes him, out of sheer wantonness.","And what's\r\nmore, the fair sex is everything for them, these butterflies and\r\nmettlesome cocks! Grand gentlemen with little wings like the ancient\r\ncupids, lady-killing Petchorins! It's all very well for you, Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch, a confirmed bachelor, to talk like that, stick up for his\r\nexcellency and call me a slanderer. But if you married a pretty young\r\nwife--as you're still such a fine fellow--then I dare say you'd bolt\r\nyour door against our prince, and throw up barricades in your house!\r\nWhy, if only that Mademoiselle Lebyadkin, who is thrashed with a whip,\r\nwere not mad and bandy-legged, by Jove, I should fancy she was the\r\nvictim of the passions of our general, and that it was from him that\r\nCaptain Lebyadkin had suffered 'in his family dignity,' as he expresses\r\nit himself.","Only perhaps that is inconsistent with his refined taste,\r\nthough, indeed, even that's no hindrance to him. Every berry is worth\r\npicking if only he's in the mood for it. You talk of slander, but I'm\r\nnot crying this aloud though the whole town is ringing with it; I only\r\nlisten and assent. That's not prohibited.\"\r\n\r\n\"The town's ringing with it? What's the town ringing with?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is, Captain Lebyadkin is shouting for all the town to hear, and\r\nisn't that just the same as the market-place ringing with it? How am I\r\nto blame? I interest myself in it only among friends, for, after all,\r\nI consider myself among friends here.","\" He looked at us with an innocent\r\nair. \"Something's happened, only consider: they say his excellency has\r\nsent three hundred roubles from Switzerland by a most honourable young\r\nlady, and, so to say, modest orphan, whom I have the honour of knowing,\r\nto be handed over to Captain Lebyadkin. And Lebyadkin, a little later,\r\nwas told as an absolute fact also by a very honourable and therefore\r\ntrustworthy person, I won't say whom, that not three hundred but a\r\nthousand roubles had been sent!.",".. And so, Lebyadkin keeps crying out\r\n'the young lady has grabbed seven hundred roubles belonging to me,' and\r\nhe's almost ready to call in the police; he threatens to, anyway, and\r\nhe's making an uproar all over the town.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is vile, vile of you!\" cried the engineer, leaping up suddenly\r\nfrom his chair.\r\n\r\n\"But I say, you are yourself the honourable person who brought word\r\nto Lebyadkin from Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch that a thousand roubles were\r\nsent, not three hundred.","Why, the captain told me so himself when he was\r\ndrunk.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's... it's an unhappy misunderstanding. Some one's made a mistake and\r\nit's led to... It's nonsense, and it's base of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I'm ready to believe that it's nonsense, and I'm distressed at the\r\nstory, for, take it as you will, a girl of an honourable reputation\r\nis implicated first over the seven hundred roubles, and secondly in\r\nunmistakable intimacy with Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch.","For how much does it\r\nmean to his excellency to disgrace a girl of good character, or put to\r\nshame another man's wife, like that incident with me? If he comes across\r\na generous-hearted man he'll force him to cover the sins of others under\r\nthe shelter of his honourable name. That's just what I had to put up\r\nwith, I'm speaking of myself....\"\r\n\r\n\"Be careful, Liputin.\" Stepan Trofimovitch got up from his easy chair\r\nand turned pale.","\"Don't believe it, don't believe it! Somebody has made a mistake\r\nand Lebyadkin's drunk...\" exclaimed the engineer in indescribable\r\nexcitement. \"It will all be explained, but I can't.... And I think it's\r\nlow.... And that's enough, enough!\"\r\n\r\nHe ran out of the room.\r\n\r\n\"What are you about? Why, I'm going with you!\" cried Liputin, startled.\r\nHe jumped up and ran after Alexey Nilitch.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch stood a moment reflecting, looked at me as though he\r\ndid not see me, took up his hat and stick and walked quietly out of\r\nthe room.","I followed him again, as before. As we went out of the gate,\r\nnoticing that I was accompanying him, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, you may serve as a witness..._de l'accident. Vous\r\nm'accompagnerez, n'est-ce pas?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Stepan Trofimovitch, surely you're not going there again? Think what\r\nmay come of it!\"\r\n\r\nWith a pitiful and distracted smile, a smile of shame and utter despair,\r\nand at the same time of a sort of strange ecstasy, he whispered to me,\r\nstanding still for an instant:\r\n\r\n\"I can't marry to cover 'another man's sins'!\"\r\n\r\nThese words were just what I was expecting.","At last that fatal sentence\r\nthat he had kept hidden from me was uttered aloud, after a whole week of\r\nshuffling and pretence. I was positively enraged.\r\n\r\n\"And you, Stepan Verhovensky, with your luminous mind, your kind heart,\r\ncan harbour such a dirty, such a low idea... and could before Liputin\r\ncame!\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me, made no answer and walked on in the same direction.\r\nI did not want to be left behind.","I wanted to give Varvara Petrovna my\r\nversion. I could have forgiven him if he had simply with his womanish\r\nfaint-heartedness believed Liputin, but now it was clear that he\r\nhad thought of it all himself long before, and that Liputin had only\r\nconfirmed his suspicions and poured oil on the flames. He had not\r\nhesitated to suspect the girl from the very first day, before he had any\r\nkind of grounds, even Liputin's words, to go upon.","Varvara Petrovna's\r\ndespotic behaviour he had explained to himself as due to her haste\r\nto cover up the aristocratic misdoings of her precious \"Nicolas\" by\r\nmarrying the girl to an honourable man! I longed for him to be punished\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\n\"_Oh, Dieu, qui est si grand et si bon!_ Oh, who will comfort me!\" he\r\nexclaimed, halting suddenly again, after walking a hundred paces.\r\n\r\n\"Come straight home and I'll make everything clear to you,\" I cried,\r\nturning him by force towards home.","\"It's he! Stepan Trofimovitch, it's you? You?\" A fresh, joyous young\r\nvoice rang out like music behind us.\r\n\r\nWe had seen nothing, but a lady on horseback suddenly made her\r\nappearance beside us--Lizaveta Nikolaevna with her invariable companion.\r\nShe pulled up her horse.\r\n\r\n\"Come here, come here quickly!\" she called to us, loudly and merrily.\r\n\"It's twelve years since I've seen him, and I know him, while he.","... Do\r\nyou really not know me?\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch clasped the hand held out to him and kissed it\r\nreverently. He gazed at her as though he were praying and could not\r\nutter a word.\r\n\r\n\"He knows me, and is glad! Mavriky Nikolaevitch, he's delighted to see\r\nme! Why is it you haven't been to see us all this fortnight? Auntie\r\ntried to persuade me you were ill and must not be disturbed; but I know\r\nAuntie tells lies.","I kept stamping and swearing at you, but I had made\r\nup my mind, quite made up my mind, that you should come to me first,\r\nthat was why I didn't send to you. Heavens, why he hasn't changed a\r\nbit!\" She scrutinised him, bending down from the saddle. \"He's absurdly\r\nunchanged. Oh, yes, he has wrinkles, a lot of wrinkles, round his eyes\r\nand on his cheeks some grey hair, but his eyes are just the same.","And\r\nhave I changed? Have I changed? Why don't you say something?\"\r\n\r\nI remembered at that moment the story that she had been almost ill when\r\nshe was taken away to Petersburg at eleven years old, and that she had\r\ncried during her illness and asked for Stepan Trofimovitch.\r\n\r\n\"You... I...\" he faltered now in a voice breaking with joy. \"I was just\r\ncrying out 'who will comfort me?' and I heard your voice.","I look on it\r\nas a miracle _et je commence √† croire_.\"\r\n\r\n\"_En Dieu! En Dieu qui est l√†-haut et qui est si grand et si bon!_ You\r\nsee, I know all your lectures by heart. Mavriky Nikolaevitch, what faith\r\nhe used to preach to me then, _en Dieu qui est si grand et si bon!_ And do\r\nyou remember your story of how Columbus discovered America, and they\r\nall cried out, 'Land! land!'? My nurse Alyona Frolovna says I was\r\nlight-headed at night afterwards, and kept crying out 'land! land!'\r\nin my sleep.","And do you remember how you told me the story of Prince\r\nHamlet? And do you remember how you described to me how the poor\r\nemigrants were transported from Europe to America? And it was all\r\nuntrue; I found out afterwards how they were transited. But what\r\nbeautiful fibs he used to tell me then, Mavriky Nikolaevitch! They were\r\nbetter than the truth. Why do you look at Mavriky Nikolaevitch like\r\nthat? He is the best and finest man on the face of the globe and you must\r\nlike him just as you do me! _Il fait tout ce que je veux.","_ But, dear Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch, you must be unhappy again, since you cry out in the middle\r\nof the street asking who will comfort you. Unhappy, aren't you? Aren't\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now I'm happy....\"\r\n\r\n\"Aunt is horrid to you?\" she went on, without listening. \"She's just the\r\nsame as ever, cross, unjust, and always our precious aunt! And do\r\nyou remember how you threw yourself into my arms in the garden and I\r\ncomforted you and cried--don't be afraid of Mavriky Nikolaevitch; he has\r\nknown all about you, everything, for ever so long; you can weep on his\r\nshoulder as long as you like, and he'll stand there as long as you like!\r\n.",".. Lift up your hat, take it off altogether for a minute, lift up your\r\nhead, stand on tiptoe, I want to kiss you on the forehead as I kissed\r\nyou for the last time when we parted. Do you see that young lady's\r\nadmiring us out of the window? Come closer, closer! Heavens! How grey he\r\nis!\"\r\n\r\nAnd bending over in the saddle she kissed him on the forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Come, now to your home! I know where you live.","I'll be with you\r\ndirectly, in a minute. I'll make you the first visit, you stubborn man,\r\nand then I must have you for a whole day at home. You can go and make\r\nready for me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she galloped off with her cavalier. We returned. Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nsat down on the sofa and began to cry.\r\n\r\n_\"Dieu, Dieu.\"_ he exclaimed, _\"enfin une minute de bonheur!\"_\r\n\r\nNot more than ten minutes afterwards she reappeared according to her\r\npromise, escorted by her Mavriky Nikolaevitch.","_\"Vous et le bonheur, vous arrivez en m√™me temps!\"_ He got up to meet her.\r\n\r\n\"Here's a nosegay for you; I rode just now to Madame Chevalier's, she\r\nhas flowers all the winter for name-days. Here's Mavriky Nikolaevitch,\r\nplease make friends. I wanted to bring you a cake instead of a nosegay,\r\nbut Mavriky Nikolaevitch declares that is not in the Russian spirit.\"\r\n\r\nMavriky Nikolaevitch was an artillery captain, a tall and handsome man\r\nof thirty-three, irreproachably correct in appearance, with an imposing\r\nand at first sight almost stern countenance, in spite of his wonderful\r\nand delicate kindness which no one could fail to perceive almost the\r\nfirst moment of making his acquaintance.","He was taciturn, however,\r\nseemed very self-possessed and made no efforts to gain friends. Many\r\nof us said later that he was by no means clever; but this was not\r\naltogether just.\r\n\r\nI won't attempt to describe the beauty of Lizaveta Nikolaevna. The\r\nwhole town was talking of it, though some of our ladies and young girls\r\nindignantly differed on the subject. There were some among them who\r\nalready detested her, and principally for her pride.","The Drozdovs had\r\nscarcely begun to pay calls, which mortified them, though the real\r\nreason for the delay was Praskovya Ivanovna's invalid state. They\r\ndetested her in the second place because she was a relative of\r\nthe governor's wife, and thirdly because she rode out every day on\r\nhorseback. We had never had young ladies who rode on horseback before;\r\nit was only natural that the appearance of Lizaveta Nikolaevna on\r\nhorseback and her neglect to pay calls was bound to offend local\r\nsociety.","Yet every one knew that riding was prescribed her by the\r\ndoctor's orders, and they talked sarcastically of her illness. She\r\nreally was ill. What struck me at first sight in her was her abnormal,\r\nnervous, incessant restlessness. Alas, the poor girl was very unhappy,\r\nand everything was explained later. To-day, recalling the past, I should\r\nnot say she was such a beauty as she seemed to me then. Perhaps she was\r\nreally not pretty at all.","Tall, slim, but strong and supple, she struck\r\none by the irregularities of the lines of her face. Her eyes were set\r\nsomewhat like a Kalmuck's, slanting; she was pale and thin in the\r\nface with high cheek-bones, but there was something in the face that\r\nconquered and fascinated! There was something powerful in the ardent\r\nglance of her dark eyes. She always made her appearance \"like a\r\nconquering heroine, and to spread her conquests.","\" She seemed proud and\r\nat times even arrogant. I don't know whether she succeeded in being\r\nkind, but I know that she wanted to, and made terrible efforts to force\r\nherself to be a little kind. There were, no doubt, many fine impulses\r\nand the very best elements in her character, but everything in her\r\nseemed perpetually seeking its balance and unable to find it; everything\r\nwas in chaos, in agitation, in uneasiness.","Perhaps the demands she made\r\nupon herself were too severe, and she was never able to find in herself\r\nthe strength to satisfy them.\r\n\r\nShe sat on the sofa and looked round the room.\r\n\r\n\"Why do I always begin to feel sad at such moments; explain that\r\nmystery, you learned person? I've been thinking all my life that\r\nI should be goodness knows how pleased at seeing you and recalling\r\neverything, and here I somehow don't feel pleased at all, although I do\r\nlove you.","... Ach, heavens! He has my portrait on the wall! Give it here.\r\nI remember it! I remember it!\"\r\n\r\nAn exquisite miniature in water-colour of Liza at twelve years old had\r\nbeen sent nine years before to Stepan Trofimovitch from Petersburg by\r\nthe Drozdovs. He had kept it hanging on his wall ever since.\r\n\r\n\"Was I such a pretty child? Can that really have been my face?\"\r\n\r\nShe stood up, and with the portrait in her hand looked in the\r\nlooking-glass.","\"Make haste, take it!\" she cried, giving back the portrait. \"Don't hang\r\nit up now, afterwards. I don't want to look at it.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat down on the sofa again. \"One life is over and another is begun,\r\nthen that one is over--a third begins, and so on, endlessly. All the\r\nends are snipped off as it were with scissors. See what stale things I'm\r\ntelling you. Yet how much truth there is in them!\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at me, smiling; she had glanced at me several times already,\r\nbut in his excitement Stepan Trofimovitch forgot that he had promised\r\nto introduce me.","\"And why have you hung my portrait under those daggers? And why have you\r\ngot so many daggers and sabres?\"\r\n\r\nHe had as a fact hanging on the wall, I don't know why, two crossed\r\ndaggers and above them a genuine Circassian sabre. As she asked this\r\nquestion she looked so directly at me that I wanted to answer, but\r\nhesitated to speak. Stepan Trofimovitch grasped the position at last and\r\nintroduced me.","\"I know, I know,\" she said, \"I'm delighted to meet you. Mother has\r\nheard a great deal about you, too. Let me introduce you to Mavriky\r\nNikolaevitch too, he's a splendid person. I had formed a funny notion of\r\nyou already. You're Stepan Trofimovitch's confidant, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\nI turned rather red.\r\n\r\n\"Ach, forgive me, please. I used quite the wrong word: not funny at all,\r\nbut only...\" She was confused and blushed.","\"Why be ashamed though at\r\nyour being a splendid person? Well, it's time we were going, Mavriky\r\nNikolaevitch! Stepan Trofimovitch, you must be with us in half an hour.\r\nMercy, what a lot we shall talk! Now I'm your confidante, and about\r\neverything, _everything,_ you understand?\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch was alarmed at once.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mavriky Nikolaevitch knows everything, don't mind him!\"\r\n\r\n\"What does he know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what do you mean?\" she cried in astonishment.","\"Bah, why it's true\r\nthen that they're hiding it! I wouldn't believe it! And they're hiding\r\nDasha, too. Aunt wouldn't let me go in to see Dasha to-day. She says\r\nshe's got a headache.\"\r\n\r\n\"But... but how did you find out?\"\r\n\r\n\"My goodness, like every one else. That needs no cunning!\"\r\n\r\n\"But does every one else...?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course. Mother, it's true, heard it first through Alyona\r\nFrolovna, my nurse; your Nastasya ran round to tell her.","You told\r\nNastasya, didn't you? She says you told her yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I... I did once speak,\" Stepan Trofimovitch faltered, crimsoning all\r\nover, \"but... I only hinted... _j'√©tais si nerveux et malade, et\r\npuis_...\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed.\r\n\r\n\"And your confidant didn't happen to be at hand, and Nastasya turned up.\r\nWell that was enough! And the whole town's full of her cronies! Come, it\r\ndoesn't matter, let them know; it's all the better.","Make haste and come\r\nto us, we dine early.... Oh, I forgot,\" she added, sitting down again;\r\n\"listen, what sort of person is Shatov?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shatov? He's the brother of Darya Pavlovna.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know he's her brother! What a person you are, really,\" she\r\ninterrupted impatiently. \"I want to know what he's like; what sort of\r\nman he is.\"\r\n\r\n_\"C'est un pense-creux d'ici. C'est le meilleur et le plus irascible\r\nhomme du monde.","\"_\r\n\r\n\"I've heard that he's rather queer. But that wasn't what I meant. I've\r\nheard that he knows three languages, one of them English, and can do\r\nliterary work. In that case I've a lot of work for him. I want someone\r\nto help me and the sooner the better. Would he take the work or not?\r\nHe's been recommended to me....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, most certainly he will. _Et vous ferez un bienfait_....\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not doing it as a _bienfait_.","I need someone to help me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know Shatov pretty well,\" I said, \"and if you will trust me with a\r\nmessage to him I'll go to him this minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell him to come to me at twelve o'clock to-morrow morning. Capital!\r\nThank you. Mavriky Nikolaevitch, are you ready?\"\r\n\r\nThey went away. I ran at once, of course, to Shatov.\r\n\r\n_\"Mon ami!\"_ said Stepan Trofimovitch, overtaking me on the steps. \"Be\r\nsure to be at my lodging at ten or eleven o'clock when I come back.","Oh,\r\nI've acted very wrongly in my conduct to you and to every one.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nI did not find Shatov at home. I ran round again, two hours later. He\r\nwas still out. At last, at eight o'clock I went to him again, meaning\r\nto leave a note if I did not find him; again I failed to find him. His\r\nlodging was shut up, and he lived alone without a servant of any sort.\r\nI did think of knocking at Captain Lebyadkin's down below to ask about\r\nShatov; but it was all shut up below, too, and there was no sound or\r\nlight as though the place were empty.","I passed by Lebyadkin's door with\r\ncuriosity, remembering the stories I had heard that day. Finally, I made\r\nup my mind to come very early next morning. To tell the truth I did not\r\nput much confidence in the effect of a note. Shatov might take no notice\r\nof it; he was so obstinate and shy. Cursing my want of success, I was\r\ngoing out of the gate when all at once I stumbled on Mr. Kirillov.\r\nHe was going into the house and he recognised me first.","As he began\r\nquestioning me of himself, I told him how things were, and that I had a\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go in,\" said he, \"I will do everything.\"\r\n\r\nI remembered that Liputin had told us he had taken the wooden lodge in\r\nthe yard that morning. In the lodge, which was too large for him, a deaf\r\nold woman who waited upon him was living too. The owner of the house had\r\nmoved into a new house in another street, where he kept a restaurant,\r\nand this old woman, a relation of his, I believe, was left behind to\r\nlook after everything in the old house.","The rooms in the lodge were\r\nfairly clean, though the wall-papers were dirty. In the one we went into\r\nthe furniture was of different sorts, picked up here and there, and all\r\nutterly worthless. There were two card-tables, a chest of drawers made\r\nof elder, a big deal table that must have come from some peasant hut\r\nor kitchen, chairs and a sofa with trellis-work back and hard leather\r\ncushions. In one corner there was an old-fashioned ikon, in front of\r\nwhich the old woman had lighted a lamp before we came in, and on the\r\nwalls hung two dingy oil-paintings, one, a portrait of the Tsar Nikolas\r\nI, painted apparently between 1820 and 1830; the other the portrait of\r\nsome bishop.","Mr. Kirillov lighted a candle and took out of his trunk,\r\nwhich stood not yet unpacked in a corner, an envelope, sealing-wax, and\r\na glass seal.\r\n\r\n\"Seal your note and address the envelope.\"\r\n\r\nI would have objected that this was unnecessary, but he insisted. When I\r\nhad addressed the envelope I took my cap.\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking you'd have tea,\" he said. \"I have bought tea. Will you?\"\r\n\r\nI could not refuse.","The old woman soon brought in the tea, that is, a\r\nvery large tea-pot of boiling water, a little tea-pot full of strong\r\ntea, two large earthenware cups, coarsely decorated, a fancy loaf, and a\r\nwhole deep saucer of lump sugar.\r\n\r\n\"I love tea at night,\" said he. \"I walk much and drink it till daybreak.\r\nAbroad tea at night is inconvenient.\"\r\n\r\n\"You go to bed at daybreak?\"\r\n\r\n\"Always; for a long while.","I eat little; always tea. Liputin's sly, but\r\nimpatient.\"\r\n\r\nI was surprised at his wanting to talk; I made up my mind to take\r\nadvantage of the opportunity. \"There were unpleasant misunderstandings\r\nthis morning,\" I observed.\r\n\r\nHe scowled.\r\n\r\n\"That's foolishness; that's great nonsense. All this is nonsense because\r\nLebyadkin is drunk. I did not tell Liputin, but only explained the\r\nnonsense, because he got it all wrong.","Liputin has a great deal of\r\nfantasy, he built up a mountain out of nonsense. I trusted Liputin\r\nyesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"And me to-day?\" I said, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"But you see, you knew all about it already this morning; Liputin is\r\nweak or impatient, or malicious or... he's envious.\"\r\n\r\nThe last word struck me.\r\n\r\n\"You've mentioned so many adjectives, however, that it would be strange\r\nif one didn't describe him.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Or all at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and that's what Liputin really is--he's a chaos. He was lying this\r\nmorning when he said you were writing something, wasn't he?\r\n\r\n\"Why should he?\" he said, scowling again and staring at the floor.\r\n\r\nI apologised, and began assuring him that I was not inquisitive. He\r\nflushed.\r\n\r\n\"He told the truth; I am writing. Only that's no matter.\"\r\n\r\nWe were silent for a minute.","He suddenly smiled with the childlike smile\r\nI had noticed that morning.\r\n\r\n\"He invented that about heads himself out of a book, and told me first\r\nhimself, and understands badly. But I only seek the causes why men dare\r\nnot kill themselves; that's all. And it's all no matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you mean they don't dare? Are there so few suicides?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very few.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you really think so?\"\r\n\r\nHe made no answer, got up, and began walking to and fro lost in thought.","\"What is it restrains people from suicide, do you think?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me absent-mindedly, as though trying to remember what we\r\nwere talking about.\r\n\r\n\"I... I don't know much yet.... Two prejudices restrain them, two\r\nthings; only two, one very little, the other very big.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the little thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pain? Can that be of importance at such a moment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of the greatest.","There are two sorts: those who kill themselves either\r\nfrom great sorrow or from spite, or being mad, or no matter what...\r\nthey do it suddenly. They think little about the pain, but kill\r\nthemselves suddenly. But some do it from reason--they think a great\r\ndeal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, are there people who do it from reason?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very many. If it were not for superstition there would be more, very\r\nmany, all.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, all?\"\r\n\r\nHe did not answer.","\"But aren't there means of dying without pain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Imagine\"--he stopped before me--\"imagine a stone as big as a great\r\nhouse; it hangs and you are under it; if it falls on you, on your head,\r\nwill it hurt you?\"\r\n\r\n\"A stone as big as a house? Of course it would be fearful.\"\r\n\r\n\"I speak not of the fear. Will it hurt?\"\r\n\r\n\"A stone as big as a mountain, weighing millions of tons? Of course it\r\nwouldn't hurt.","\"\r\n\r\n\"But really stand there and while it hangs you will fear very much that\r\nit will hurt. The most learned man, the greatest doctor, all, all will\r\nbe very much frightened. Every one will know that it won't hurt, and\r\nevery one will be afraid that it will hurt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, and the second cause, the big one?\"\r\n\r\n\"The other world!\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean punishment?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's no matter. The other world; only the other world.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there no atheists, such as don't believe in the other world at\r\nall?\"\r\n\r\nAgain he did not answer.\r\n\r\n\"You judge from yourself, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every one cannot judge except from himself,\" he said, reddening. \"There\r\nwill be full freedom when it will be just the same to live or not to\r\nlive. That's the goal for all.\"\r\n\r\n\"The goal? But perhaps no one will care to live then?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one,\" he pronounced with decision.","\"Man fears death because he loves life. That's how I understand it,\" I\r\nobserved, \"and that's determined by nature.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's abject; and that's where the deception comes in.\" His eyes\r\nflashed. \"Life is pain, life is terror, and man is unhappy. Now all is\r\npain and terror. Now man loves life, because he loves pain and terror,\r\nand so they have done according. Life is given now for pain and terror,\r\nand that's the deception.","Now man is not yet what he will be. There will\r\nbe a new man, happy and proud. For whom it will be the same to live or\r\nnot to live, he will be the new man. He who will conquer pain and terror\r\nwill himself be a god. And this God will not be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then this God does exist according to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He does not exist, but He is. In the stone there is no pain, but in the\r\nfear of the stone is the pain. God is the pain of the fear of death.","He\r\nwho will conquer pain and terror will become himself a god. Then there\r\nwill be a new life, a new man; everything will be new... then they will\r\ndivide history into two parts: from the gorilla to the annihilation of\r\nGod, and from the annihilation of God to...\"\r\n\r\n\"To the gorilla?\"\r\n\r\n\"... To the transformation of the earth, and of man physically. Man\r\nwill be God, and will be transformed physically, and the world will\r\nbe transformed and things will be transformed and thoughts and all\r\nfeelings.","What do you think: will man be changed physically then?\"\r\n\r\n\"If it will be just the same living or not living, all will kill\r\nthemselves, and perhaps that's what the change will be?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's no matter. They will kill deception. Every one who wants the\r\nsupreme freedom must dare to kill himself. He who dares to kill himself\r\nhas found out the secret of the deception. There is no freedom beyond;\r\nthat is all, and there is nothing beyond.","He who dares kill himself is\r\nGod. Now every one can do so that there shall be no God and shall be\r\nnothing. But no one has once done it yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"There have been millions of suicides.\"\r\n\r\n\"But always not for that; always with terror and not for that object.\r\nNot to kill fear. He who kills himself only to kill fear will become a\r\ngod at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"He won't have time, perhaps,\" I observed.\r\n\r\n\"That's no matter,\" he answered softly, with calm pride, almost disdain.","\"I'm sorry that you seem to be laughing,\" he added half a minute later.\r\n\r\n\"It seems strange to me that you were so irritable this morning and are\r\nnow so calm, though you speak with warmth.\"\r\n\r\n\"This morning? It was funny this morning,\" he answered with a smile. \"I\r\ndon't like scolding, and I never laugh,\" he added mournfully.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you don't spend your nights very cheerfully over your tea.\"\r\n\r\nI got up and took my cap.","\"You think not?\" he smiled with some surprise. \"Why? No, I... I don't\r\nknow.\" He was suddenly confused. \"I know not how it is with the others,\r\nand I feel that I cannot do as others. Everybody thinks and then at once\r\nthinks of something else. I can't think of something else. I think all\r\nmy life of one thing. God has tormented me all my life,\" he ended up\r\nsuddenly with astonishing expansiveness.","\"And tell me, if I may ask, why is it you speak Russian not quite\r\ncorrectly? Surely you haven't forgotten it after five years abroad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't I speak correctly? I don't know. No, it's not because of abroad.\r\nI have talked like that all my life... it's no matter to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another question, a more delicate one. I quite believe you that you're\r\ndisinclined to meet people and talk very little.","Why have you talked to\r\nme now?\"\r\n\r\n\"To you? This morning you sat so nicely and you... but it's all no\r\nmatter... you are like my brother, very much, extremely,\" he added,\r\nflushing. \"He has been dead seven years. He was older, very, very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose he had a great influence on your way of thinking?\"\r\n\r\n\"N-no. He said little; he said nothing. I'll give your note.\"\r\n\r\nHe saw me to the gate with a lantern, to lock it after me.","\"Of course\r\nhe's mad,\" I decided. In the gateway I met with another encounter.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nI had only just lifted my leg over the high barrier across the bottom of\r\nthe gateway, when suddenly a strong hand clutched at my chest.\r\n\r\n\"Who's this?\" roared a voice, \"a friend or an enemy? Own up!\"\r\n\r\n\"He's one of us; one of us!\" Liputin's voice squealed near by. \"It's Mr.\r\nG----v, a young man of classical education, in touch with the highest\r\nsociety.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I love him if he's in society, clas-si... that means he's high-ly\r\ned-u-cated. The retired Captain Ignat Lebyadkin, at the service of the\r\nworld and his friends... if they're true ones, if they're true ones, the\r\nscoundrels.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Lebyadkin, a stout, fleshy man over six feet in height, with\r\ncurly hair and a red face, was so extremely drunk that he could scarcely\r\nstand up before me, and articulated with difficulty.","I had seen him\r\nbefore, however, in the distance.\r\n\r\n\"And this one!\" he roared again, noticing Kirillov, who was still\r\nstanding with the lantern; he raised his fist, but let it fall again at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\"I forgive you for your learning! Ignat Lebyadkin--high-ly\r\ned-u-cated....\r\n\r\n     'A bomb of love with stinging smart\r\n     Exploded in Ignaty's heart.\r\n     In anguish dire I weep again\r\n     The arm that at Sevastopol\r\n     I lost in bitter pain!'\r\n\r\nNot that I ever was at Sevastopol, or ever lost my arm, but you know\r\nwhat rhyme is.","\" He pushed up to me with his ugly, tipsy face.\r\n\r\n\"He is in a hurry, he is going home!\" Liputin tried to persuade him.\r\n\"He'll tell Lizaveta Nikolaevna to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lizaveta!\" he yelled again. \"Stay, don't go!\r\n\r\n     A variation:\r\n     'Among the Amazons a star,\r\n     Upon her steed she flashes by,\r\n     And smiles upon me from afar,\r\n     The child of aris-to-cra-cy!\r\n     To a Starry Amazon.","'\r\n\r\nYou know that's a hymn. It's a hymn, if you're not an ass! The duffers,\r\nthey don't understand! Stay!\"\r\n\r\nHe caught hold of my coat, though I pulled myself away with all my\r\nmight.\r\n\r\n\"Tell her I'm a knight and the soul of honour, and as for that Dasha...\r\nI'd pick her up and chuck her out.... She's only a serf, she daren't...\"\r\n\r\nAt this point he fell down, for I pulled myself violently out of his\r\nhands and ran into the street.","Liputin clung on to me.\r\n\r\n\"Alexey Nilitch will pick him up. Do you know what I've just found out\r\nfrom him?\" he babbled in desperate haste. \"Did you hear his verses? He's\r\nsealed those verses to the 'Starry Amazon' in an envelope and is going\r\nto send them to-morrow to Lizaveta Nikolaevna, signed with his name in\r\nfull. What a fellow!\"\r\n\r\n\"I bet you suggested it to him yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll lose your bet,\" laughed Liputin.","\"He's in love, in love like a\r\ncat, and do you know it began with hatred. He hated Lizaveta Nikolaevna\r\nat first so much, for riding on horseback that he almost swore aloud at\r\nher in the street. Yes, he did abuse her! Only the day before yesterday\r\nhe swore at her when she rode by--luckily she didn't hear. And,\r\nsuddenly, to-day--poetry! Do you know he means to risk a proposal?\r\nSeriously! Seriously!\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder at you, Liputin; whenever there's anything nasty going on\r\nyou're always on the spot taking a leading part in it,\" I said angrily.","\"You're going rather far, Mr. G----v. Isn't your poor little\r\nheart quaking, perhaps, in terror of a rival?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wha-at!\" I cried, standing still.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now to punish you I won't say anything more, and wouldn't you\r\nlike to know though? Take this alone, that that lout is not a simple\r\ncaptain now but a landowner of our province, and rather an important\r\none, too, for Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch sold him all his estate the other\r\nday, formerly of two hundred serfs; and as God's above, I'm not lying.","I've only just heard it, but it was from a most reliable source. And now\r\nyou can ferret it out for yourself; I'll say nothing more; good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch was awaiting me with hysterical impatience. It\r\nwas an hour since he had returned. I found him in a state resembling\r\nintoxication; for the first five minutes at least I thought he was\r\ndrunk. Alas, the visit to the Drozdovs had been the finishing-stroke.","\"_Mon ami!_ I have completely lost the thread... Lise... I love and\r\nrespect that angel as before; just as before; but it seems to me they\r\nboth asked me simply to find out something from me, that is more simply\r\nto get something out of me, and then to get rid of me.... That's how it\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought to be ashamed!\" I couldn't help exclaiming.\r\n\r\n\"My friend, now I am utterly alone. _Enfin, c'est ridicule.","_  Would you\r\nbelieve it, the place is positively packed with mysteries there too. They\r\nsimply flew at me about those ears and noses, and some mysteries in\r\nPetersburg too. You know they hadn't heard till they came about the tricks\r\nNicolas played here four years ago. 'You were here, you saw it, is it true that\r\nhe is mad?' Where they got the idea I can't make out. Why is it that\r\nPraskovya is so anxious Nicolas should be mad? The woman will have it so,\r\nshe will.","_Ce Maurice,_ or what's his name, Mavriky Nikolaevitch, _brave\r\nhomme tout de m√™me..._ but can it be for his sake, and after she wrote\r\nherself from Paris to _cette pauvre amie?... Enfin,_ this Praskovya, as _cette\r\nch√®re amie_ calls her, is a type. She's Gogol's Madame Box, of immortal\r\nmemory, only she's a spiteful Madame Box, a malignant Box, and in an\r\nimmensely exaggerated form.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's making her out a regular packing-case if it's an exaggerated\r\nform.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps it's the opposite; it's all the same, only don't\r\ninterrupt me, for I'm all in a whirl. They are all at loggerheads,\r\nexcept Lise, she keeps on with her 'Auntie, auntie!' but Lise's sly, and\r\nthere's something behind it too. Secrets. She has quarrelled with the\r\nold lady. _Cette pauvre_ auntie tyrannises over every one it's true, and\r\nthen there's the governor's wife, and the rudeness of local society, and\r\nKarmazinov's 'rudeness'; and then this idea of madness, _ce Lipoutine,\r\nce que je ne comprends pas.",".._ and... and they say she's been putting\r\nvinegar on her head, and here are we with our complaints and\r\nletters.... Oh, how I have tormented her and at such a time! _Je suis un\r\ningrat!_ Only imagine, I come back and find a letter from her; read it,\r\nread it! Oh, how ungrateful it was of me!\"\r\n\r\nHe gave me a letter he had just received from Varvara Petrovna. She\r\nseemed to have repented of her \"stay at home.","\" The letter was amiable\r\nbut decided in tone, and brief. She invited Stepan Trofimovitch to come\r\nto her the day after to-morrow, which was Sunday, at twelve o'clock, and\r\nadvised him to bring one of his friends with him. (My name was mentioned\r\nin parenthesis). She promised on her side to invite Shatov, as the\r\nbrother of Darya Pavlovna. \"You can obtain a final answer from her: will\r\nthat be enough for you? Is this the formality you were so anxious for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Observe that irritable phrase about formality.","Poor thing, poor thing,\r\nthe friend of my whole life! I confess the sudden determination of my\r\nwhole future almost crushed me.... I confess I still had hopes, but now\r\n_tout est dit._ I know now that all is over. _C'est terrible!_ Oh, that\r\nthat Sunday would never come and everything would go on in the old way.\r\nYou would have gone on coming and I'd have gone on here....\"\r\n\r\n\"You've been upset by all those nasty things Liputin said, those\r\nslanders.","\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear, you have touched on another sore spot with your friendly\r\nfinger. Such friendly fingers are generally merciless and sometimes\r\nunreasonable; _pardon,_ you may not believe it, but I'd almost forgotten\r\nall that, all that nastiness, not that I forgot it, indeed, but in\r\nmy foolishness I tried all the while I was with Lise to be happy and\r\npersuaded myself I was happy. But now... Oh, now I'm thinking of\r\nthat generous, humane woman, so long-suffering with my contemptible\r\nfailings--not that she's been altogether long-suffering, but what have\r\nI been with my horrid, worthless character! I'm a capricious child, with\r\nall the egoism of a child and none of the innocence.","For the last twenty\r\nyears she's been looking after me like a nurse, _cette pauvre_ auntie, as\r\nLise so charmingly calls her.... And now, after twenty years, the child\r\nclamours to be married, sending letter after letter, while her head's\r\nin a vinegar-compress and... now he's got it--on Sunday I shall be a\r\nmarried man, that's no joke.... And why did I keep insisting myself,\r\nwhat did I write those letters for? Oh, I forgot.","Lise idolizes Darya\r\nPavlovna, she says so anyway; she says of her '_c'est un ange,_ only\r\nrather a reserved one.' They both advised me, even Praskovya. ...\r\nPraskovya didn't advise me though. Oh, what venom lies concealed in\r\nthat 'Box'! And Lise didn't exactly advise me: 'What do you want to get\r\nmarried for,' she said, 'your intellectual pleasures ought to be enough\r\nfor you.' She laughed. I forgive her for laughing, for there's an ache\r\nin her own heart.","You can't get on without a woman though, they said to\r\nme. The infirmities of age are coming upon you, and she will tuck you\r\nup, or whatever it is.... _Ma foi,_ I've been thinking myself all this\r\ntime I've been sitting with you that Providence was sending her to me\r\nin the decline of my stormy years and that she would tuck me up, or\r\nwhatever they call it... _enfin,_ she'll be handy for the housekeeping.","See what a litter there is, look how everything's lying about. I said it\r\nmust be cleared up this morning, and look at the book on the floor! _La\r\npauvre amie_ was always angry at the untidiness here. ... Ah, now I shall\r\nno longer hear her voice! _Vingt ans!_ And it seems they've had anonymous\r\nletters. Only fancy, it's said that Nicolas has sold Lebyadkin his\r\nproperty. _C'est un monstre; et enfin_ what is Lebyadkin? Lise listens,\r\nand listens, ooh, how she listens! I forgave her laughing.","I saw her\r\nface as she listened, and _ce Maurice..._I shouldn't care to be in his\r\nshoes now, _brave homme tout de m√™me,_ but rather shy; but never mind\r\nhim....\"\r\n\r\nHe paused. He was tired and upset, and sat with drooping head, staring\r\nat the floor with his tired eyes. I took advantage of the interval to\r\ntell him of my visit to Filipov's house, and curtly and dryly expressed\r\nmy opinion that Lebyadkin's sister (whom I had never seen) really\r\nmight have been somehow victimised by Nicolas at some time during that\r\nmysterious period of his life, as Liputin had called it, and that it\r\nwas very possible that Lebyadkin received sums of money from Nicolas for\r\nsome reason, but that was all.","As for the scandal about Darya Pavlovna,\r\nthat was all nonsense, all that brute Liputin's misrepresentations, that\r\nthis was anyway what Alexey Nilitch warmly maintained, and we had\r\nno grounds for disbelieving him. Stepan Trofimovitch listened to my\r\nassurances with an absent air, as though they did not concern him. I\r\nmentioned by the way my conversation with Kirillov, and added that he\r\nmight be mad.","\"He's not mad, but one of those shallow-minded people,\" he mumbled\r\nlistlessly. \"_Ces gens-l√† supposent la nature et la societ√© humaine\r\nautres que Dieu ne les a faites et qu'elles ne sont r√©ellement._ People\r\ntry to make up to them, but Stepan Verhovensky does not, anyway. I saw\r\nthem that time in Petersburg _avec cette ch√®re amie_ (oh, how I used to\r\nwound her then), and I wasn't afraid of their abuse or even of their\r\npraise.","I'm not afraid now either. _Mais parlons d'autre chose...._\r\nI believe I have done dreadful things. Only fancy, I sent a letter\r\nyesterday to Darya Pavlovna and... how I curse myself for it!\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you write about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my friend, believe me, it was all done in a noble spirit. I let\r\nher know that I had written to Nicolas five days before, also in a noble\r\nspirit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand now!\" I cried with heat.","\"And what right had you to couple\r\ntheir names like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, _mon cher,_ don't crush me completely, don't shout at me; as it is\r\nI'm utterly squashed like... a black-beetle. And, after all, I thought\r\nit was all so honourable. Suppose that something really happened...\r\n_en Suisse_...or was beginning. I was bound to question their hearts\r\nbeforehand that I..._enfin,_ that I might not constrain their hearts,\r\nand be a stumbling-block in their paths.","I acted simply from honourable\r\nfeeling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, heavens! What a stupid thing you've done!\" I cried involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" he assented with positive eagerness. \"You have never said\r\nanything more just, _c'√©tait b√™te, mais que faire? Tout est dit._ I shall\r\nmarry her just the same even if it be to cover 'another's sins.' So\r\nthere was no object in writing, was there?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're at that idea again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you won't frighten me with your shouts now.","You see a different\r\nStepan Verhovensky before you now. The man I was is buried. _Enfin,\r\ntout est dit._ And why do you cry out? Simply because you're not getting\r\nmarried, and you won't have to wear a certain decoration on your head.\r\nDoes that shock you again? My poor friend, you don't know woman, while\r\nI have done nothing but study her. 'If you want to conquer the world,\r\nconquer yourself'--the one good thing that another romantic like you, my\r\nbride's brother, Shatov, has succeeded in saying.","I would gladly borrow\r\nfrom him his phrase. Well, here I am ready to conquer myself, and I'm\r\ngetting married. And what am I conquering by way of the whole world?\r\nOh, my friend, marriage is the moral death of every proud soul, of all\r\nindependence. Married life will corrupt me, it will sap my energy, my\r\ncourage in the service of the cause. Children will come, probably not my\r\nown either--certainly not my own: a wise man is not afraid to face the\r\ntruth.","Liputin proposed this morning putting up barricades to keep out\r\nNicolas; Liputin's a fool. A woman would deceive the all-seeing eye\r\nitself. _Le bon Dieu_ knew what He was in for when He was creating woman,\r\nbut I'm sure that she meddled in it herself and forced Him to create her\r\nsuch as she is... and with such attributes: for who would have incurred\r\nso much trouble for nothing? I know Nastasya may be angry with me for\r\nfree-thinking, but.",".._enfin, tout est dit._\"\r\n\r\nHe wouldn't have been himself if he could have dispensed with the cheap\r\ngibing free-thought which was in vogue in his day. Now, at any rate, he\r\ncomforted himself with a gibe, but not for long.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if that day after to-morrow, that Sunday, might never come!\" he\r\nexclaimed suddenly, this time in utter despair. \"Why could not this\r\none week be without a Sunday--_si le miracle existe_? What would it be to\r\nProvidence to blot out one Sunday from the calendar? If only to prove\r\nHis power to the atheists _et que tout soit dit!_ Oh, how I loved her!\r\nTwenty years, these twenty years, and she has never understood me!\"\r\n\r\n\"But of whom are you talking? Even I don't understand you!\" I asked,\r\nwondering.","\"_Vingt ans!_ And she has not once understood me; oh, it's cruel! And can\r\nshe really believe that I am marrying from fear, from poverty? Oh, the\r\nshame of it! Oh, Auntie, Auntie, I do it for you!... Oh, let her know,\r\nthat Auntie, that she is the one woman I have adored for twenty years!\r\nShe must learn this, it must be so, if not they will need force to drag\r\nme under _ce qu'on appelle le_ wedding-crown.","\"\r\n\r\nIt was the first time I had heard this confession, and so vigorously\r\nuttered. I won't conceal the fact that I was terribly tempted to laugh.\r\nI was wrong.\r\n\r\n\"He is the only one left me now, the only one, my one hope!\" he cried\r\nsuddenly, clasping his hands as though struck by a new idea. \"Only he,\r\nmy poor boy, can save me now, and, oh, why doesn't he come! Oh, my son,\r\noh, my Petrusha.... And though I do not deserve the name of father,\r\nbut rather that of tiger, yet.",".._Laissez-moi, mon ami,_ I'll lie down a\r\nlittle, to collect my ideas. I am so tired, so tired. And I think it's\r\ntime you were in bed. _Voyez vous,_ it's twelve o'clock....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. THE CRIPPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nSHATOV WAS NOT PERVERSE but acted on my note, and called at midday on\r\nLizaveta Nikolaevna. We went in almost together; I was also going to\r\nmake my first call. They were all, that is Liza, her mother, and Mavriky\r\nNikolaevitch, sitting in the big drawing-room, arguing.","The mother was\r\nasking Liza to play some waltz on the piano, and as soon as Liza began\r\nto play the piece asked for, declared it was not the right one.\r\nMavriky Nikolaevitch in the simplicity of his heart took Liza's part,\r\nmaintaining that it was the right waltz. The elder lady was so angry\r\nthat she began to cry. She was ill and walked with difficulty. Her\r\nlegs were swollen, and for the last few days she had been continually\r\nfractious, quarrelling with every one, though she always stood rather\r\nin awe of Liza.","They were pleased to see us. Liza flushed with pleasure,\r\nand saying _\"merci\"_ to me, on Shatov's account of course, went to meet\r\nhim, looking at him with interest.\r\n\r\nShatov stopped awkwardly in the doorway. Thanking him for coming she led\r\nhim up to her mother.\r\n\r\n\"This is Mr. Shatov, of whom I have told you, and this is Mr. G----v, a\r\ngreat friend of mine and of Stepan Trofimovitch's. Mavriky Nikolaevitch\r\nmade his acquaintance yesterday, too.","\"\r\n\r\n\"And which is the professor?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no professor at all, maman.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there is. You said yourself that there'd be a professor. It's this\r\none, probably.\" She disdainfully indicated Shatov.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't tell you that there'd be a professor. Mr. G----v is\r\nin the service, and Mr. Shatov is a former student.\"\r\n\r\n\"A student or professor, they all come from the university just the\r\nsame. You only want to argue.","But the Swiss one had moustaches and a\r\nbeard.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the son of Stepan Trofimovitch that maman always calls the\r\nprofessor,\" said Liza, and she took Shatov away to the sofa at the other\r\nend of the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\"When her legs swell, she's always like this, you understand she's\r\nill,\" she whispered to Shatov, still with the same marked curiosity,\r\nscrutinising him, especially his shock of hair.","\"Are you an officer?\" the old lady inquired of me. Liza had mercilessly\r\nabandoned me to her.\r\n\r\n\"N-no.--I'm in the service....\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. G----v is a great friend of Stepan Trofimovitch's,\" Liza chimed in\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\"Are you in Stepan Trofimovitch's service? Yes, and he's a professor,\r\ntoo, isn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, maman, you must dream at night of professors,\" cried Liza with\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\n\"I see too many when I'm awake.","But you always will contradict your\r\nmother. Were you here four years ago when Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was in\r\nthe neighbourhood?\"\r\n\r\nI answered that I was.\r\n\r\n\"And there was some Englishman with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, there was not.\"\r\n\r\nLiza laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see there was no Englishman, so it must have been idle\r\ngossip. And Varvara Petrovna and Stepan Trofimovitch both tell lies. And\r\nthey all tell lies.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Auntie and Stepan Trofimovitch yesterday thought there was a\r\nresemblance between Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch and Prince Harry in\r\nShakespeare's _Henry IV_, and in answer to that maman says that there was\r\nno Englishman here,\" Liza explained to us.\r\n\r\n\"If Harry wasn't here, there was no Englishman. It was no one else but\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch at his tricks.\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure you that maman's doing it on purpose,\" Liza thought necessary\r\nto explain to Shatov.","\"She's really heard of Shakespeare. I read her the\r\nfirst act of _Othello_ myself. But she's in great pain now. Maman, listen,\r\nit's striking twelve, it's time you took your medicine.\"\r\n\r\n\"The doctor's come,\" a maid-servant announced at the door.\r\n\r\nThe old lady got up and began calling her dog: \"Zemirka, Zemirka, you\r\ncome with me at least.\"\r\n\r\nZemirka, a horrid little old dog, instead of obeying, crept under the\r\nsofa where Liza was sitting.","\"Don't you want to? Then I don't want you. Good-bye, my good sir, I\r\ndon't know your name or your father's,\" she said, addressing me.\r\n\r\n\"Anton Lavrentyevitch...\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it doesn't matter, with me it goes in at one ear and out of the\r\nother. Don't you come with me, Mavriky Nikolaevitch, it was Zemirka I\r\ncalled. Thank God I can still walk without help and to-morrow I shall go\r\nfor a drive.\"\r\n\r\nShe walked angrily out of the drawing-room.","\"Anton Lavrentyevitch, will you talk meanwhile to Mavriky Nikolaevitch;\r\nI assure you you'll both be gainers by getting to know one another\r\nbetter,\" said Liza, and she gave a friendly smile to Mavriky\r\nNikolaevitch, who beamed all over as she looked at him. There was no\r\nhelp for it, I remained to talk to Mavriky Nikolaevitch.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nLizaveta Nikolaevna's business with Shatov turned out, to my surprise,\r\nto be really only concerned with literature.","I had imagined, I don't\r\nknow why, that she had asked him to come with some other object. We,\r\nMavriky Nikolaevitch and I that is, seeing that they were talking aloud\r\nand not trying to hide anything from us, began to listen, and at last\r\nthey asked our advice. It turned out that Lizaveta Nikolaevna was\r\nthinking of bringing out a book which she thought would be of use,\r\nbut being quite inexperienced she needed someone to help her.","The\r\nearnestness with which she began to explain her plan to Shatov quite\r\nsurprised me.\r\n\r\n\"She must be one of the new people,\" I thought. \"She has not been to\r\nSwitzerland for nothing.\"\r\n\r\nShatov listened with attention, his eyes fixed on the ground, showing\r\nnot the slightest surprise that a giddy young lady in society should\r\ntake up work that seemed so out of keeping with her.\r\n\r\nHer literary scheme was as follows.","Numbers of papers and journals are\r\npublished in the capitals and the provinces of Russia, and every day a\r\nnumber of events are reported in them. The year passes, the newspapers\r\nare everywhere folded up and put away in cupboards, or are torn up\r\nand become litter, or are used for making parcels or wrapping things.\r\nNumbers of these facts make an impression and are remembered by the\r\npublic, but in the course of years they are forgotten.","Many people would\r\nlike to look them up, but it is a labour for them to embark upon this\r\nsea of paper, often knowing nothing of the day or place or even year in\r\nwhich the incident occurred. Yet if all the facts for a whole year were\r\nbrought together into one book, on a definite plan, and with a definite\r\nobject, under headings with references, arranged according to months and\r\ndays, such a compilation might reflect the characteristics of Russian\r\nlife for the whole year, even though the facts published are only a\r\nsmall fraction of the events that take place.","\"Instead of a number of newspapers there would be a few fat books,\r\nthat's all,\" observed Shatov.\r\n\r\nBut Lizaveta Nikolaevna clung to her idea, in spite of the difficulty\r\nof carrying it out and her inability to describe it. \"It ought to be\r\none book, and not even a very thick one,\" she maintained. But even if it\r\nwere thick it would be clear, for the great point would be the plan and\r\nthe character of the presentation of facts.","Of course not all would\r\nbe collected and reprinted. The decrees and acts of government,\r\nlocal regulations, laws--all such facts, however important, might be\r\naltogether omitted from the proposed publication. They could leave out a\r\ngreat deal and confine themselves to a selection of events more or\r\nless characteristic of the moral life of the people, of the personal\r\ncharacter of the Russian people at the present moment.","Of course\r\neverything might be put in: strange incidents, fires, public\r\nsubscriptions, anything good or bad, every speech or word, perhaps even\r\nfloodings of the rivers, perhaps even some government decrees, but\r\nonly such things to be selected as are characteristic of the period;\r\neverything would be put in with a certain view, a special significance\r\nand intention, with an idea which would illuminate the facts looked\r\nat in the aggregate, as a whole.","And finally the book ought to be\r\ninteresting even for light reading, apart from its value as a work of\r\nreference. It would be, so to say, a presentation of the spiritual,\r\nmoral, inner life of Russia for a whole year.\r\n\r\n\"We want every one to buy it, we want it to be a book that will be found\r\non every table,\" Liza declared. \"I understand that all lies in the plan,\r\nand that's why I apply to you,\" she concluded.","She grew very warm over\r\nit, and although her explanation was obscure and incomplete, Shatov\r\nbegan to understand.\r\n\r\n\"So it would amount to something with a political tendency, a selection\r\nof facts with a special tendency,\" he muttered, still not raising his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, we must not select with a particular bias, and we ought\r\nnot to have any political tendency in it. Nothing but impartiality--that\r\nwill be the only tendency.","\"\r\n\r\n\"But a tendency would be no harm,\" said Shatov, with a slight movement,\r\n\"and one can hardly avoid it if there is any selection at all. The very\r\nselection of facts will suggest how they are to be understood. Your idea\r\nis not a bad one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then such a book is possible?\" cried Liza delightedly.\r\n\r\n\"We must look into it and consider. It's an immense undertaking. One\r\ncan't work it out on the spur of the moment.","We need experience. And\r\nwhen we do publish the book I doubt whether we shall find out how to\r\ndo it. Possibly after many trials; but the thought is alluring. It's a\r\nuseful idea.\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyes at last, and they were positively sparkling with\r\npleasure, he was so interested.\r\n\r\n\"Was it your own idea?\" he asked Liza, in a friendly and, as it were,\r\nbashful way.\r\n\r\n\"The idea's no trouble, you know, it's the plan is the trouble,\" Liza\r\nsmiled.","\"I understand very little. I am not very clever, and I only\r\npursue what is clear to me, myself....\"\r\n\r\n\"Pursue?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps that's not the right word?\" Liza inquired quickly.\r\n\r\n\"The word is all right; I meant nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought while I was abroad that even I might be of some use. I have\r\nmoney of my own lying idle. Why shouldn't I--even I--work for the common\r\ncause? Besides, the idea somehow occurred to me all at once of itself.","I didn't invent it at all, and was delighted with it. But I saw at\r\nonce that I couldn't get on without someone to help, because I am not\r\ncompetent to do anything of myself. My helper, of course, would be the\r\nco-editor of the book. We would go halves. You would give the plan and\r\nthe work. Mine would be the original idea and the means for publishing\r\nit. Would the book pay its expenses, do you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"If we hit on a good plan the book will go.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I warn you that I am not doing it for profit; but I am very anxious\r\nthat the book should circulate and should be very proud of making a\r\nprofit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but how do I come in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I invite you to be my fellow-worker, to go halves. You will think\r\nout the plan.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that I am capable of thinking out the plan?\"\r\n\r\n\"People have talked about you to me, and here I've heard\r\n.",".. I know that you are very clever and... are working for the cause ...\r\nand think a great deal. Pyotr Stepanovitch Verhovensky spoke about you\r\nin Switzerland,\" she added hurriedly. \"He's a very clever man, isn't\r\nhe?\"\r\n\r\nShatov stole a fleeting, momentary glance at her, but dropped his eyes\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch told me a great deal about you, too.\"\r\n\r\nShatov suddenly turned red.\r\n\r\n\"But here are the newspapers.","\" Liza hurriedly picked up from a chair\r\na bundle of newspapers that lay tied up ready. \"I've tried to mark\r\nthe facts here for selection, to sort them, and I have put the papers\r\ntogether... you will see.\"\r\n\r\nShatov took the bundle.\r\n\r\n\"Take them home and look at them. Where do you live?\"\r\n\r\n\"In Bogoyavlensky Street, Filipov's house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. I think it's there, too, I've been told, a captain lives,\r\nbeside you, Mr.","Lebyadkin,\" said Liza in the same hurried manner.\r\n\r\nShatov sat for a full minute with the bundle in his outstretched hand,\r\nmaking no answer and staring at the floor.\r\n\r\n\"You'd better find someone else for these jobs. I shouldn't suit you at\r\nall,\" he brought out at last, dropping his voice in an awfully strange\r\nway, almost to a whisper.\r\n\r\nLiza flushed crimson.\r\n\r\n\"What jobs are you speaking of? Mavriky Nikolaevitch,\" she cried,\r\n\"please bring that letter here.","\"\r\n\r\nI too followed Mavriky Nikolaevitch to the table.\r\n\r\n\"Look at this,\" she turned suddenly to me, unfolding the letter in great\r\nexcitement. \"Have you ever seen anything like it. Please read it aloud.\r\nI want Mr. Shatov to hear it too.\"\r\n\r\nWith no little astonishment I read aloud the following missive:\r\n\r\n     \"To the Perfection, Miss Tushin.\r\n\r\n\"Gracious Lady\r\n    \"Lizaveta Nikolaevna!\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, she's a sweet queen,\r\n     Lizaveta Tushin!\r\n     When on side-saddle she gallops by,\r\n     And in the breeze her fair tresses fly!\r\n     Or when with her mother in church she bows low\r\n     And on devout faces a red flush doth flow!\r\n     Then for the joys of lawful wedlock I aspire,\r\n     And follow her and her mother with tears of desire.","\"Composed by an unlearned man in the midst of a discussion.\r\n\r\n\"Gracious Lady!\r\n\r\n\"I pity myself above all men that I did not lose my arm at Sevastopol,\r\nnot having been there at all, but served all the campaign delivering\r\npaltry provisions, which I look on as a degradation. You are a goddess\r\nof antiquity, and I am nothing, but have had a glimpse of infinity.\r\nLook on it as a poem and no more, for, after all, poetry is nonsense and\r\njustifies what would be considered impudence in prose.","Can the sun be\r\nangry with the infusoria if the latter composes verses to her from the\r\ndrop of water, where there is a multitude of them if you look through\r\nthe microscope? Even the club for promoting humanity to the larger\r\nanimals in tip-top society in Petersburg, which rightly feels compassion\r\nfor dogs and horses, despises the brief infusoria making no reference\r\nto it whatever, because it is not big enough.","I'm not big enough either.\r\nThe idea of marriage might seem droll, but soon I shall have property\r\nworth two hundred souls through a misanthropist whom you ought to\r\ndespise. I can tell a lot and I can undertake to produce documents\r\nthat would mean Siberia. Don't despise my proposal. A letter from an\r\ninfusoria is of course in verse.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Lebyadkin your most humble friend.\r\n\r\n\"And he has time no end.","\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That was written by a man in a drunken condition, a worthless fellow,\"\r\nI cried indignantly. \"I know him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That letter I received yesterday,\" Liza began to explain, flushing\r\nand speaking hurriedly. \"I saw myself, at once, that it came from some\r\nfoolish creature, and I haven't yet shown it to maman, for fear of\r\nupsetting her more. But if he is going to keep on like that, I don't\r\nknow how to act.","Mavriky Nikolaevitch wants to go out and forbid him to\r\ndo it. As I have looked upon you as a colleague,\" she turned to Shatov,\r\n\"and as you live there, I wanted to question you so as to judge what\r\nmore is to be expected of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a drunkard and a worthless fellow,\" Shatov muttered with apparent\r\nreluctance.\r\n\r\n\"Is he always so stupid?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he's not stupid at all when he's not drunk.\"\r\n\r\n\"I used to know a general who wrote verses exactly like that,\" I\r\nobserved, laughing.","\"One can see from the letter that he is clever enough for his own\r\npurposes,\" Mavriky Nikolaevitch, who had till then been silent, put in\r\nunexpectedly.\r\n\r\n\"He lives with some sister?\" Liza queried.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, with his sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"They say he tyrannises over her, is that true?\"\r\n\r\nShatov looked at Liza again, scowled, and muttering, \"What business is\r\nit of mine?\" moved towards the door.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, stay!\" cried Liza, in a flutter.","\"Where are you going? We have so\r\nmuch still to talk over....\"\r\n\r\n\"What is there to talk over? I'll let you know to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the most important thing of all--the printing-press! Do believe me\r\nthat I am not in jest, that I really want to work in good earnest!\" Liza\r\nassured him in growing agitation. \"If we decide to publish it, where is\r\nit to be printed? You know it's a most important question, for we shan't\r\ngo to Moscow for it, and the printing-press here is out of the\r\nquestion for such a publication.","I made up my mind long ago to set up\r\na printing-press of my own, in your name perhaps--and I know maman will\r\nallow it so long as it is in your name....\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that I could be a printer?\" Shatov asked sullenly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Pyotr Stepanovitch told me of you in Switzerland, and referred\r\nme to you as one who knows the business and able to set up a\r\nprinting-press. He even meant to give me a note to you from himself, but\r\nI forgot it.","\"\r\n\r\nShatov's face changed, as I recollect now. He stood for a few seconds\r\nlonger, then went out of the room.\r\n\r\nLiza was angry.\r\n\r\n\"Does he always go out like that?\" she asked, turning to me.\r\n\r\nI was just shrugging my shoulders when Shatov suddenly came back, went\r\nstraight up to the table and put down the roll of papers he had taken.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to be your helper, I haven't the time....\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? Why? I think you are angry!\" Liza asked him in a grieved and\r\nimploring voice.","The sound of her voice seemed to strike him; for some moments he looked\r\nat her intently, as though trying to penetrate to her very soul.\r\n\r\n\"No matter,\" he muttered, softly, \"I don't want to....\"\r\n\r\nAnd he went away altogether.\r\n\r\nLiza was completely overwhelmed, quite disproportionately in fact, so it\r\nseemed to me.\r\n\r\n\"Wonderfully queer man,\" Mavriky Nikolaevitch observed aloud.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nHe certainly was queer, but in all this there was a very great deal not\r\nclear to me.","There was something underlying it all. I simply did not\r\nbelieve in this publication; then that stupid letter, in which there\r\nwas an offer, only too barefaced, to give information and produce\r\n\"documents,\" though they were all silent about that, and talked of\r\nsomething quite different; finally that printing-press and Shatov's\r\nsudden exit, just because they spoke of a printing-press. All this led\r\nme to imagine that something had happened before I came in of which I\r\nknew nothing; and, consequently, that it was no business of mine and\r\nthat I was in the way.","And, indeed, it was time to take leave, I had\r\nstayed long enough for the first call. I went up to say good-bye to\r\nLizaveta Nikolaevna.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to have forgotten that I was in the room, and was still\r\nstanding in the same place by the table with her head bowed, plunged in\r\nthought, gazing fixedly at one spot on the carpet.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you, too, are going, good-bye,\" she murmured in an ordinary\r\nfriendly tone.","\"Give my greetings to Stepan Trofimovitch, and persuade\r\nhim to come and see me as soon as he can. Mavriky Nikolaevitch, Anton\r\nLavrentyevitch is going. Excuse maman's not being able to come out and\r\nsay good-bye to you....\"\r\n\r\nI went out and had reached the bottom of the stairs when a footman\r\nsuddenly overtook me at the street door.\r\n\r\n\"My lady begs you to come back....\"\r\n\r\n\"The mistress, or Lizaveta Nikolaevna?\"\r\n\r\n\"The young lady.","\"\r\n\r\nI found Liza not in the big room where we had been sitting, but in the\r\nreception-room next to it. The door between it and the drawing-room,\r\nwhere Mavriky Nikolaevitch was left alone, was closed.\r\n\r\nLiza smiled to me but was pale. She was standing in the middle of the\r\nroom in evident indecision, visibly struggling with herself; but she\r\nsuddenly took me by the hand, and led me quickly to the window.","\"I want to see _her_ at once,\" she whispered, bending upon me a\r\nburning, passionate, impatient glance, which would not admit a hint of\r\nopposition. \"I must see her with my own eyes, and I beg you to help\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nShe was in a perfect frenzy, and--in despair.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it you want to see, Lizaveta Nikolaevna?\" I inquired in dismay.\r\n\r\n\"That Lebyadkin's sister, that lame girl.... Is it true that she's\r\nlame?\"\r\n\r\nI was astounded.","\"I have never seen her, but I've heard that she's lame. I heard it\r\nyesterday,\" I said with hurried readiness, and also in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"I must see her, absolutely. Could you arrange it to-day?\"\r\n\r\nI felt dreadfully sorry for her.\r\n\r\n\"That's utterly impossible, and, besides, I should not know at all how\r\nto set about it,\" I began persuading her. \"I'll go to Shatov....\"\r\n\r\n\"If you don't arrange it by to-morrow I'll go to her by myself, alone,\r\nfor Mavriky Nikolaevitch has refused.","I rest all my hopes on you and\r\nI've no one else; I spoke stupidly to Shatov.... I'm sure that you are\r\nperfectly honest and perhaps ready to do anything for me, only arrange\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nI felt a passionate desire to help her in every way.\r\n\r\n\"This is what I'll do,\" I said, after a moment's thought. \"I'll go\r\nmyself to-day and will see her for sure, for sure. I will manage so\r\nas to see her. I give you my word of honour.","Only let me confide in\r\nShatov.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell him that I do desire it, and that I can't wait any longer, but\r\nthat I wasn't deceiving him just now. He went away perhaps because\r\nhe's very honest and he didn't like my seeming to deceive him. I\r\nwasn't deceiving him, I really do want to edit books and found a\r\nprinting-press....\"\r\n\r\n\"He is honest, very honest,\" I assented warmly.\r\n\r\n\"If it's not arranged by to-morrow, though, I shall go myself whatever\r\nhappens, and even if every one were to know.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't be with you before three o'clock to-morrow,\" I observed, after\r\na moment's deliberation.\r\n\r\n\"At three o'clock then. Then it was true what I imagined yesterday at\r\nStepan Trofimovitch's, that you--are rather devoted to me?\" she said\r\nwith a smile, hurriedly pressing my hand to say good-bye, and hurrying\r\nback to the forsaken Mavriky Nikolaevitch.\r\n\r\nI went out weighed down by my promise, and unable to understand what\r\nhad happened.","I had seen a woman in real despair, not hesitating to\r\ncompromise herself by confiding in a man she hardly knew. Her womanly\r\nsmile at a moment so terrible for her and her hint that she had noticed\r\nmy feelings the day before sent a pang to my heart; but I felt sorry\r\nfor her, very sorry--that was all! Her secrets became at once something\r\nsacred for me, and if anyone had begun to reveal them to me now, I think\r\nI should have covered my ears, and should have refused to hear anything\r\nmore.","I only had a presentiment of something... yet I was utterly at\r\na loss to see how I could do anything. What's more I did not even yet\r\nunderstand exactly what I had to arrange; an interview, but what sort\r\nof an interview? And how could I bring them together? My only hope was\r\nShatov, though I could be sure that he wouldn't help me in any way. But\r\nall the same, I hurried to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nI did not find him at home till past seven o'clock that evening.","To my\r\nsurprise he had visitors with him--Alexey Nilitch, and another gentleman\r\nI hardly knew, one Shigalov, the brother of Virginsky's wife.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman must, I think, have been staying about two months in\r\nthe town; I don't know where he came from. I had only heard that he\r\nhad written some sort of article in a progressive Petersburg magazine.\r\nVirginsky had introduced me casually to him in the street.","I had\r\nnever in my life seen in a man's face so much despondency, gloom, and\r\nmoroseness. He looked as though he were expecting the destruction of the\r\nworld, and not at some indefinite time in accordance with prophecies,\r\nwhich might never be fulfilled, but quite definitely, as though it were\r\nto be the day after to-morrow at twenty-five minutes past ten. We hardly\r\nsaid a word to one another on that occasion, but had simply shaken hands\r\nlike two conspirators.","I was most struck by his ears, which were of\r\nunnatural size, long, broad, and thick, sticking out in a peculiar way.\r\nHis gestures were slow and awkward.\r\n\r\nIf Liputin had imagined that a phalanstery might be established in our\r\nprovince, this gentleman certainly knew the day and the hour when it\r\nwould be founded. He made a sinister impression on me. I was the more\r\nsurprised at finding him here, as Shatov was not fond of visitors.","I could hear from the stairs that they were talking very loud, all three\r\nat once, and I fancy they were disputing; but as soon as I went in, they\r\nall ceased speaking. They were arguing, standing up, but now they all\r\nsuddenly sat down, so that I had to sit down too. There was a stupid\r\nsilence that was not broken for fully three minutes. Though Shigalov\r\nknew me, he affected not to know me, probably not from hostile feelings,\r\nbut for no particular reason.","Alexey Nilitch and I bowed to one another\r\nin silence, and for some reason did not shake hands. Shigalov began at\r\nlast looking at me sternly and frowningly, with the most na√Øve assurance\r\nthat I should immediately get up and go away. At last Shatov got up from\r\nhis chair and the others jumped up at once. They went out without saying\r\ngood-bye. Shigalov only said in the doorway to Shatov, who was seeing\r\nhim out:\r\n\r\n\"Remember that you are bound to give an explanation.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Hang your explanation, and who the devil am I bound to?\" said Shatov.\r\nHe showed them out and fastened the door with the latch.\r\n\r\n\"Snipes!\" he said, looking at me, with a sort of wry smile.\r\n\r\nHis face looked angry, and it seemed strange to me that he spoke first.\r\nWhen I had been to see him before (which was not often) it had usually\r\nhappened that he sat scowling in a corner, answered ill-humouredly\r\nand only completely thawed and began to talk with pleasure after a\r\nconsiderable time.","Even so, when he was saying good-bye he always\r\nscowled, and let one out as though he were getting rid of a personal\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n\"I had tea yesterday with that Alexey Nilitch,\" I observed. \"I think\r\nhe's mad on atheism.\"\r\n\r\n\"Russian atheism has never gone further than making a joke,\" growled\r\nShatov, putting up a new candle in place of an end that had burnt out.\r\n\r\n\"No, this one doesn't seem to me a joker, I think he doesn't know how to\r\ntalk, let alone trying to make jokes.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Men made of paper! It all comes from flunkeyism of thought,\" Shatov\r\nobserved calmly, sitting down on a chair in the corner, and pressing the\r\npalms of both hands on his knees.\r\n\r\n\"There's hatred in it, too,\" he went on, after a minute's pause.\r\n\"They'd be the first to be terribly unhappy if Russia could be suddenly\r\nreformed, even to suit their own ideas, and became extraordinarily\r\nprosperous and happy.","They'd have no one to hate then, no one to curse,\r\nnothing to find fault with. There is nothing in it but an immense animal\r\nhatred for Russia which has eaten into their organism.... And it isn't\r\na case of tears unseen by the world under cover of a smile! There has\r\nnever been a falser word said in Russia than about those unseen tears,\"\r\nhe cried, almost with fury.\r\n\r\n\"Goodness only knows what you're saying,\" I laughed.","\"Oh, you're a 'moderate liberal,'\" said Shatov, smiling too. \"Do you\r\nknow,\" he went on suddenly, \"I may have been talking nonsense about the\r\n'flunkeyism of thought.' You will say to me no doubt directly, 'it's you\r\nwho are the son of a flunkey, but I'm not a flunkey.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't dreaming of such a thing.... What are you saying!\"\r\n\r\n\"You need not apologise. I'm not afraid of you. Once I was only the\r\nson of a flunkey, but now I've become a flunkey myself, like you.","Our\r\nRussian liberal is a flunkey before everything, and is only looking for\r\nsomeone whose boots he can clean.\"\r\n\r\n\"What boots? What allegory is this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Allegory, indeed! You are laughing, I see.... Stepan Trofimovitch said\r\ntruly that I lie under a stone, crushed but not killed, and do nothing\r\nbut wriggle. It was a good comparison of his.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stepan Trofimovitch declares that you are mad over the Germans,\" I\r\nlaughed.","\"We've borrowed something from them anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"We took twenty kopecks, but we gave up a hundred roubles of our own.\"\r\n\r\nWe were silent a minute.\r\n\r\n\"He got that sore lying in America.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who? What sore?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean Kirillov. I spent four months with him lying on the floor of a\r\nhut.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, have you been in America?\" I asked, surprised. \"You never told me\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is there to tell? The year before last we spent our last farthing,\r\nthree of us, going to America in an emigrant steamer, to test the\r\nlife of the American workman on ourselves, and to verify by personal\r\nexperiment the state of a man in the hardest social conditions.","That was\r\nour object in going there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" I laughed. \"You'd much better have gone somewhere in our\r\nprovince at harvest-time if you wanted to 'make a personal experiment'\r\ninstead of bolting to America.\"\r\n\r\n\"We hired ourselves out as workmen to an exploiter; there were six of\r\nus Russians working for him--students, even landowners coming from their\r\nestates, some officers, too, and all with the same grand object.","Well,\r\nso we worked, sweated, wore ourselves out; Kirillov and I were exhausted\r\nat last; fell ill--went away--we couldn't stand it. Our employer cheated\r\nus when he paid us off; instead of thirty dollars, as he had agreed, he\r\npaid me eight and Kirillov fifteen; he beat us, too, more than once. So\r\nthen we were left without work, Kirillov and I, and we spent four months\r\nlying on the floor in that little town.","He thought of one thing and I\r\nthought of another.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to say your employer beat you? In America? How you must\r\nhave sworn at him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it. On the contrary, Kirillov and I made up our minds\r\nfrom the first that we Russians were like little children beside the\r\nAmericans, and that one must be born in America, or at least live for\r\nmany years with Americans to be on a level with them.","And do you know,\r\nif we were asked a dollar for a thing worth a farthing, we used to pay\r\nit with pleasure, in fact with enthusiasm. We approved of everything:\r\nspiritualism, lynch-law, revolvers, tramps. Once when we were travelling\r\na fellow slipped his hand into my pocket, took my brush, and began\r\nbrushing his hair with it. Kirillov and I only looked at one another,\r\nand made up our minds that that was the right thing and that we liked it\r\nvery much.","...\"\r\n\r\n\"The strange thing is that with us all this is not only in the brain but\r\nis carried out in practice,\" I observed.\r\n\r\n\"Men made of paper,\" Shatov repeated.\r\n\r\n\"But to cross the ocean in an emigrant steamer, though, to go to an\r\nunknown country, even to make a personal experiment and all that--by\r\nJove... there really is a large-hearted staunchness about it.... But\r\nhow did you get out of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wrote to a man in Europe and he sent me a hundred roubles.","\"\r\n\r\nAs Shatov talked he looked doggedly at the ground as he always did, even\r\nwhen he was excited. At this point he suddenly raised his head.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to know the man's name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nikolay Stavrogin.\"\r\n\r\nHe got up suddenly, turned to his limewood writing-table and\r\nbegan searching for something on it. There was a vague, though\r\nwell-authenticated rumour among us that Shatov's wife had at one time\r\nhad a liaison with Nikolay Stavrogin, in Paris, and just about two years\r\nago, that is when Shatov was in America.","It is true that this was long\r\nafter his wife had left him in Geneva.\r\n\r\n\"If so, what possesses him now to bring his name forward and to lay\r\nstress on it?\" I thought.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't paid him back yet,\" he said, turning suddenly to me again,\r\nand looking at me intently he sat down in the same place as before in\r\nthe corner, and asked abruptly, in quite a different voice:\r\n\r\n\"You have come no doubt with some object.","What do you want?\"\r\n\r\nI told him everything immediately, in its exact historical order, and\r\nadded that though I had time to think it over coolly after the first\r\nexcitement was over, I was more puzzled than ever. I saw that it meant\r\nsomething very important to Lizaveta Nikolaevna. I was extremely anxious\r\nto help her, but the trouble was that I didn't know how to keep the\r\npromise I had made her, and didn't even quite understand now what I had\r\npromised her.","Then I assured him impressively once more that she had not\r\nmeant to deceive him, and had had no thought of doing so; that there had\r\nbeen some misunderstanding, and that she had been very much hurt by the\r\nextraordinary way in which he had gone off that morning.\r\n\r\nHe listened very attentively.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I was stupid this morning, as I usually am.... Well, if she\r\ndidn't understand why I went away like that.",".. so much the better for\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nHe got up, went to the door, opened it, and began listening on the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to see that person yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I wanted, but how is it to be done?\" I cried,\r\ndelighted.\r\n\r\n\"Let's simply go down while she's alone. When he comes in he'll beat\r\nher horribly if he finds out we've been there. I often go in on the sly.\r\nI went for him this morning when he began beating her again.","\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I dragged him off her by the hair. He tried to beat me, but I\r\nfrightened him, and so it ended. I'm afraid he'll come back drunk, and\r\nwon't forget it--he'll give her a bad beating because of it.\"\r\n\r\nWe went downstairs at once.\r\n\r\nThe Lebyadkins' door was shut but not locked, and we were able to go in.\r\nTheir lodging consisted of two nasty little rooms, with smoke-begrimed\r\nwalls on which the filthy wall-paper literally hung in tatters.","It\r\nhad been used for some years as an eating-house, until Filipov, the\r\ntavern-keeper, moved to another house. The other rooms below what had\r\nbeen the eating-house were now shut up, and these two were all the\r\nLebyadkins had. The furniture consisted of plain benches and deal\r\ntables, except for an old arm-chair that had lost its arms. In the\r\nsecond room there was the bedstead that belonged to Mlle.","Lebyadkin\r\nstanding in the corner, covered with a chintz quilt; the captain himself\r\nwent to bed anywhere on the floor, often without undressing. Everything\r\nwas in disorder, wet and filthy; a huge soaking rag lay in the middle\r\nof the floor in the first room, and a battered old shoe lay beside it\r\nin the wet. It was evident that no one looked after anything here. The\r\nstove was not heated, food was not cooked; they had not even a samovar\r\nas Shatov told me.","The captain had come to the town with his sister\r\nutterly destitute, and had, as Liputin said, at first actually gone from\r\nhouse to house begging. But having unexpectedly received some money, he\r\nhad taken to drinking at once, and had become so besotted that he was\r\nincapable of looking after things.\r\n\r\nMlle. Lebyadkin, whom I was so anxious to see, was sitting quietly at\r\na deal kitchen table on a bench in the corner of the inner room, not\r\nmaking a sound.","When we opened the door she did not call out to us or\r\neven move from her place. Shatov said that the door into the passage\r\nwould not lock and it had once stood wide open all night. By the dim\r\nlight of a thin candle in an iron candlestick, I made out a woman of\r\nabout thirty, perhaps, sickly and emaciated, wearing an old dress of\r\ndark cotton material, with her long neck uncovered, her scanty dark hair\r\ntwisted into a knot on the nape of her neck, no larger than the fist of\r\na two-year-old child.","She looked at us rather cheerfully. Besides the\r\ncandlestick, she had on the table in front of her a little peasant\r\nlooking-glass, an old pack of cards, a tattered book of songs, and a\r\nwhite roll of German bread from which one or two bites had been taken.\r\nIt was noticeable that Mlle. Lebyadkin used powder and rouge, and\r\npainted her lips. She also blackened her eyebrows, which were fine,\r\nlong, and black enough without that.","Three long wrinkles stood sharply\r\nconspicuous across her high, narrow forehead in spite of the powder on\r\nit. I already knew that she was lame, but on this occasion she did not\r\nattempt to get up or walk. At some time, perhaps in early youth, that\r\nwasted face may have been pretty; but her soft, gentle grey eyes were\r\nremarkable even now. There was something dreamy and sincere in her\r\ngentle, almost joyful, expression.","This gentle serene joy, which was\r\nreflected also in her smile, astonished me after all I had heard of the\r\nCossack whip and her brother's violence. Strange to say, instead of the\r\noppressive repulsion and almost dread one usually feels in the presence\r\nof these creatures afflicted by God, I felt it almost pleasant to look\r\nat her from the first moment, and my heart was filled afterwards with\r\npity in which there was no trace of aversion.","\"This is how she sits literally for days together, utterly alone,\r\nwithout moving; she tries her fortune with the cards, or looks in the\r\nlooking-glass,\" said Shatov, pointing her out to me from the doorway.\r\n\"He doesn't feed her, you know. The old woman in the lodge brings her\r\nsomething sometimes out of charity; how can they leave her all alone\r\nlike this with a candle!\"\r\n\r\nTo my surprise Shatov spoke aloud, just as though she were not in the\r\nroom.","\"Good day, Shatushka!\" Mlle. Lebyadkin said genially.\r\n\r\n\"I've brought you a visitor, Marya Timofyevna,\" said Shatov.\r\n\r\n\"The visitor is very welcome. I don't know who it is you've brought, I\r\ndon't seem to remember him.\" She scrutinised me intently from behind the\r\ncandle, and turned again at once to Shatov (and she took no more notice\r\nof me for the rest of the conversation, as though I had not been near\r\nher).","\"Are you tired of walking up and down alone in your garret?\" she\r\nlaughed, displaying two rows of magnificent teeth.\r\n\r\n\"I was tired of it, and I wanted to come and see you.\"\r\n\r\nShatov moved a bench up to the table, sat down on it and made me sit\r\nbeside him.\r\n\r\n\"I'm always glad to have a talk, though you're a funny person,\r\nShatushka, just like a monk. When did you comb your hair last? Let me\r\ndo it for you.","\" And she pulled a little comb out of her pocket. \"I don't\r\nbelieve you've touched it since I combed it last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I haven't got a comb,\" said Shatov, laughing too.\r\n\r\n\"Really? Then I'll give you mine; only remind me, not this one but\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\nWith a most serious expression she set to work to comb his hair. She\r\neven parted it on one side; drew back a little, looked to see whether it\r\nwas right and put the comb back in her pocket.","\"Do you know what, Shatushka?\" She shook her head. \"You may be a very\r\nsensible man but you're dull. It's strange for me to look at all of you.\r\nI don't understand how it is people are dull. Sadness is not dullness.\r\nI'm happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"And are you happy when your brother's here?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean Lebyadkin? He's my footman. And I don't care whether he's\r\nhere or not. I call to him: 'Lebyadkin, bring the water!' or 'Lebyadkin,\r\nbring my shoes!' and he runs.","Sometimes one does wrong and can't help\r\nlaughing at him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just how it is,\" said Shatov, addressing me aloud without\r\nceremony. \"She treats him just like a footman. I've heard her myself\r\ncalling to him, 'Lebyadkin, give me some water!' And she laughed as\r\nshe said it. The only difference is that he doesn't fetch the water but\r\nbeats her for it; but she isn't a bit afraid of him. She has some sort\r\nof nervous fits, almost every day, and they are destroying her memory\r\nso that afterwards she forgets everything that's just happened, and is\r\nalways in a muddle over time.","You imagine she remembers how you came in;\r\nperhaps she does remember, but no doubt she has changed everything to\r\nplease herself, and she takes us now for different people from what we\r\nare, though she knows I'm 'Shatushka.' It doesn't matter my speaking\r\naloud, she soon leaves off listening to people who talk to her, and\r\nplunges into dreams. Yes, plunges. She's an extraordinary person for\r\ndreaming; she'll sit for eight hours, for whole days together in the\r\nsame place.","You see there's a roll lying there, perhaps she's only taken\r\none bite at it since the morning, and she'll finish it to-morrow. Now\r\nshe's begun trying her fortune on cards....\"\r\n\r\n\"I keep trying my fortune, Shatushka, but it doesn't come out right,\"\r\nMarya Timofyevna put in suddenly, catching the last word, and without\r\nlooking at it she put out her left hand for the roll (she had heard\r\nsomething about the roll too very likely).","She got hold of the roll\r\nat last and after keeping it for some time in her left hand, while her\r\nattention was distracted by the conversation which sprang up again, she\r\nput it back again on the table unconsciously without having taken a bite\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\"It always comes out the same, a journey, a wicked man, somebody's\r\ntreachery, a death-bed, a letter, unexpected news. I think it's all\r\nnonsense.","Shatushka, what do you think? If people can tell lies why\r\nshouldn't a card?\" She suddenly threw the cards together again. \"I said\r\nthe same thing to Mother Praskovya, she's a very venerable woman, she\r\nused to run to my cell to tell her fortune on the cards, without letting\r\nthe Mother Superior know. Yes, and she wasn't the only one who came to\r\nme. They sigh, and shake their heads at me, they talk it over while I\r\nlaugh.","'Where are you going to get a letter from, Mother Praskovya,' I\r\nsay, 'when you haven't had one for twelve years?' Her daughter had been\r\ntaken away to Turkey by her husband, and for twelve years there had been\r\nno sight nor sound of her. Only I was sitting the next evening at tea\r\nwith the Mother Superior (she was a princess by birth), there was some\r\nlady there too, a visitor, a great dreamer, and a little monk from Athos\r\nwas sitting there too, a rather absurd man to my thinking.","What do you\r\nthink, Shatushka, that monk from Athos had brought Mother Praskovya a\r\nletter from her daughter in Turkey, that morning--so much for the knave\r\nof diamonds--unexpected news! We were drinking our tea, and the monk\r\nfrom Athos said to the Mother Superior, 'Blessed Mother Superior, God\r\nhas blessed your convent above all things in that you preserve so great\r\na treasure in its precincts,' said he.","'What treasure is that?' asked\r\nthe Mother Superior. 'The Mother Lizaveta, the Blessed.' This Lizaveta\r\nthe Blessed was enshrined in the nunnery wall, in a cage seven feet long\r\nand five feet high, and she had been sitting there for seventeen years\r\nin nothing but a hempen shift, summer and winter, and she always kept\r\npecking at the hempen cloth with a straw or a twig of some sort, and she\r\nnever said a word, and never combed her hair, or washed, for seventeen\r\nyears.","In the winter they used to put a sheepskin in for her, and every\r\nday a piece of bread and a jug of water. The pilgrims gaze at her, sigh\r\nand exclaim, and make offerings of money. 'A treasure you've pitched\r\non,' answered the Mother Superior--(she was angry, she disliked Lizaveta\r\ndreadfully)--'Lizaveta only sits there out of spite, out of pure\r\nobstinacy, it is nothing but hypocrisy.' I didn't like this; I was\r\nthinking at the time of shutting myself up too.","'I think,' said I, 'that\r\nGod and nature are just the same thing.' They all cried out with\r\none voice at me, 'Well, now!' The Mother Superior laughed, whispered\r\nsomething to the lady and called me up, petted me, and the lady gave me\r\na pink ribbon. Would you like me to show it to you? And the monk began\r\nto admonish me. But he talked so kindly, so humbly, and so wisely, I\r\nsuppose. I sat and listened.","'Do you understand?' he asked. 'No,' I\r\nsaid, 'I don't understand a word, but leave me quite alone.' Ever since\r\nthen they've left me in peace, Shatushka. And at that time an old woman\r\nwho was living in the convent doing penance for prophesying the future,\r\nwhispered to me as she was coming out of church, 'What is the mother of\r\nGod? What do you think?' 'The great mother,' I answer, 'the hope of\r\nthe human race.","' 'Yes,' she answered, 'the mother of God is the great\r\nmother--the damp earth, and therein lies great joy for men. And every\r\nearthly woe and every earthly tear is a joy for us; and when you water\r\nthe earth with your tears a foot deep, you will rejoice at everything at\r\nonce, and your sorrow will be no more, such is the prophecy.' That word\r\nsank into my heart at the time. Since then when I bow down to the ground\r\nat my prayers, I've taken to kissing the earth.","I kiss it and weep. And\r\nlet me tell you, Shatushka, there's no harm in those tears; and even\r\nif one has no grief, one's tears flow from joy. The tears flow of\r\nthemselves, that's the truth. I used to go out to the shores of the\r\nlake; on one side was our convent and on the other the pointed mountain,\r\nthey called it the Peak. I used to go up that mountain, facing the east,\r\nfall down to the ground, and weep and weep, and I don't know how long\r\nI wept, and I don't remember or know anything about it.","I would get up,\r\nand turn back when the sun was setting, it was so big, and splendid and\r\nglorious--do you like looking at the sun, Shatushka? It's beautiful but\r\nsad. I would turn to the east again, and the shadow, the shadow of our\r\nmountain was flying like an arrow over our lake, long, long and narrow,\r\nstretching a mile beyond, right up to the island on the lake and cutting\r\nthat rocky island right in two, and as it cut it in two, the sun would\r\nset altogether and suddenly all would be darkness.","And then I used to be\r\nquite miserable, suddenly I used to remember, I'm afraid of the dark,\r\nShatushka. And what I wept for most was my baby....\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, had you one?\" And Shatov, who had been listening attentively all\r\nthe time, nudged me with his elbow.\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course. A little rosy baby with tiny little nails, and my only\r\ngrief is I can't remember whether it was a boy or a girl. Sometimes\r\nI remember it was a boy, and sometimes it was a girl.","And when he was\r\nborn, I wrapped him in cambric and lace, and put pink ribbons on him,\r\nstrewed him with flowers, got him ready, said prayers over him. I took\r\nhim away un-christened and carried him through the forest, and I was\r\nafraid of the forest, and I was frightened, and what I weep for most is\r\nthat I had a baby and I never had a husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you had one?\" Shatov queried cautiously.","\"You're absurd, Shatushka, with your reflections. I had, perhaps I had,\r\nbut what's the use of my having had one, if it's just the same as though\r\nI hadn't. There's an easy riddle for you. Guess it!\" she laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you take your baby?\"\r\n\r\n\"I took it to the pond,\" she said with a sigh.\r\n\r\nShatov nudged me again.\r\n\r\n\"And what if you never had a baby and all this is only a wild dream?\"\r\n\r\n\"You ask me a hard question, Shatushka,\" she answered dreamily, without\r\na trace of surprise at such a question.","\"I can't tell you anything about\r\nthat, perhaps I hadn't; I think that's only your curiosity. I shan't\r\nleave off crying for him anyway, I couldn't have dreamt it.\" And big\r\ntears glittered in her eyes. \"Shatushka, Shatushka, is it true that your\r\nwife ran away from you?\"\r\n\r\nShe suddenly put both hands on his shoulders, and looked at him\r\npityingly. \"Don't be angry, I feel sick myself. Do you know, Shatushka,\r\nI've had a dream: he came to me again, he beckoned me, called me.","'My\r\nlittle puss,' he cried to me, 'little puss, come to me!' And I was more\r\ndelighted at that 'little puss' than anything; he loves me, I thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he will come in reality,\" Shatov muttered in an undertone.\r\n\r\n\"No, Shatushka, that's a dream.... He can't come in reality. You know\r\nthe song:\r\n\r\n     'A new fine house I do not crave,\r\n     This tiny cell's enough for me;\r\n     There will I dwell my soul to save\r\n     And ever pray to God for thee.","'\r\n\r\nAch, Shatushka, Shatushka, my dear, why do you never ask me about\r\nanything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you won't tell. That's why I don't ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't tell, I won't tell,\" she answered quickly. \"You may kill me, I\r\nwon't tell. You may burn me, I won't tell. And whatever I had to bear\r\nI'd never tell, people won't find out!\"\r\n\r\n\"There, you see. Every one has something of their own,\" Shatov said,\r\nstill more softly, his head drooping lower and lower.","\"But if you were to ask perhaps I should tell, perhaps I should!\"\r\nshe repeated ecstatically. \"Why don't you ask? Ask, ask me nicely,\r\nShatushka, perhaps I shall tell you. Entreat me, Shatushka, so that I\r\nshall consent of myself. Shatushka, Shatushka!\"\r\n\r\nBut Shatushka was silent. There was complete silence lasting a minute.\r\nTears slowly trickled down her painted cheeks. She sat forgetting her\r\ntwo hands on Shatov's shoulders, but no longer looking at him.","\"Ach, what is it to do with me, and it's a sin.\" Shatov suddenly got up\r\nfrom the bench.\r\n\r\n\"Get up!\" He angrily pulled the bench from under me and put it back\r\nwhere it stood before.\r\n\r\n\"He'll be coming, so we must mind he doesn't guess. It's time we were\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ach, you're talking of my footman,\" Marya Timofyevna laughed suddenly.\r\n\"You're afraid of him. Well, good-bye, dear visitors, but listen for one\r\nminute, I've something to tell you.","That Nilitch came here with Filipov,\r\nthe landlord, a red beard, and my fellow had flown at me just then, so\r\nthe landlord caught hold of him and pulled him about the room while he\r\nshouted 'It's not my fault, I'm suffering for another man's sin!' So\r\nwould you believe it, we all burst out laughing....\"\r\n\r\n\"Ach, Timofyevna, why it was I, not the red beard, it was I pulled\r\nhim away from you by his hair, this morning; the landlord came the day\r\nbefore yesterday to make a row; you've mixed it up.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay, I really have mixed it up. Perhaps it was you. Why dispute about\r\ntrifles? What does it matter to him who it is gives him a beating?\" She\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\"Come along!\" Shatov pulled me. \"The gate's creaking, he'll find us and\r\nbeat her.\"\r\n\r\nAnd before we had time to run out on to the stairs we heard a drunken\r\nshout and a shower of oaths at the gate.\r\n\r\nShatov let me into his room and locked the door.","\"You'll have to stay a minute if you don't want a scene. He's squealing\r\nlike a little pig, he must have stumbled over the gate again. He falls\r\nflat every time.\"\r\n\r\nWe didn't get off without a scene, however.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nShatov stood at the closed door of his room and listened; suddenly he\r\nsprang back.\r\n\r\n\"He's coming here, I knew he would,\" he whispered furiously. \"Now\r\nthere'll be no getting rid of him till midnight.","\"\r\n\r\nSeveral violent thumps of a fist on the door followed.\r\n\r\n\"Shatov, Shatov, open!\" yelled the captain. \"Shatov, friend!\r\n\r\n    'I have come, to thee to tell thee\r\n     That the sun doth r-r-rise apace,\r\n     That the forest glows and tr-r-rembles\r\n     In... the fire of...his...embrace.\r\n     Tell thee I have waked, God damn thee,\r\n     Wakened under the birch-twigs....'\r\n\r\n  (\"As it might be under the birch-rods, ha ha!\")\r\n\r\n    'Every little bird.","..is...thirsty,\r\n     Says I'm going to...have a drink,\r\n     But I don't...know what to drink....'\r\n\r\n\"Damn his stupid curiosity! Shatov, do you understand how good it is to\r\nbe alive!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't answer!\" Shatov whispered to me again.\r\n\r\n\"Open the door! Do you understand that there's something higher than\r\nbrawling... in mankind; there are moments of an hon-hon-honourable\r\nman.... Shatov, I'm good; I'll forgive you.","... Shatov, damn the\r\nmanifestoes, eh?\"\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n\"Do you understand, you ass, that I'm in love, that I've bought a\r\ndress-coat, look, the garb of love, fifteen roubles; a captain's love\r\ncalls for the niceties of style.... Open the door!\" he roared savagely\r\nall of a sudden, and he began furiously banging with his fists again.\r\n\r\n\"Go to hell!\" Shatov roared suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"S-s-slave! Bond-slave, and your sister's a slave, a bondswoman.",".. a\r\nth... th... ief!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you sold your sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a lie! I put up with the libel though. I could with one word...\r\ndo you understand what she is?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" Shatov at once drew near the door inquisitively.\r\n\r\n\"But will you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I shall understand, tell me what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not afraid to say! I'm never afraid to say anything in public!...\"\r\n\r\n\"You not afraid? A likely story,\" said Shatov, taunting him, and nodding\r\nto me to listen.","\"Me afraid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me afraid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then, tell away if you're not afraid of your master's whip....\r\nYou're a coward, though you are a captain!\"\r\n\r\n\"I... I... she's... she's...\" faltered Lebyadkin in a voice shaking with\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" Shatov put his ear to the door.\r\n\r\nA silence followed, lasting at least half a minute.\r\n\r\n\"Sc-ou-oundrel!\" came from the other side of the door at last, and the\r\ncaptain hurriedly beat a retreat downstairs, puffing like a samovar,\r\nstumbling on every step.","\"Yes, he's a sly one, and won't give himself away even when he's drunk.\"\r\n\r\nShatov moved away from the door.\r\n\r\n\"What's it all about?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nShatov waved aside the question, opened the door and began listening\r\non the stairs again. He listened a long while, and even stealthily\r\ndescended a few steps. At last he came back.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing to be heard; he isn't beating her; he must have flopped\r\ndown at once to go to sleep.","It's time for you to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Shatov, what am I to gather from all this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, gather what you like!\" he answered in a weary and disgusted voice,\r\nand he sat down to his writing-table.\r\n\r\nI went away. An improbable idea was growing stronger and stronger in my\r\nmind. I thought of the next day with distress....\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThis \"next day,\" the very Sunday which was to decide Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch's fate irrevocably, was one of the most memorable days in\r\nmy chronicle.","It was a day of surprises, a day that solved past riddles\r\nand suggested new ones, a day of startling revelations, and still more\r\nhopeless perplexity. In the morning, as the reader is already aware, I\r\nhad by Varvara Petrovna's particular request to accompany my friend on\r\nhis visit to her, and at three o'clock in the afternoon I had to be with\r\nLizaveta Nikolaevna in order to tell her--I did not know what--and to\r\nassist her--I did not know how.","And meanwhile it all ended as no one\r\ncould have expected. In a word, it was a day of wonderful coincidences.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, when Stepan Trofimovitch and I arrived at Varvara\r\nPetrovna's at twelve o'clock punctually, the time she had fixed, we did\r\nnot find her at home; she had not yet come back from church. My poor\r\nfriend was so disposed, or, more accurately speaking, so indisposed that\r\nthis circumstance crushed him at once; he sank almost helpless into\r\nan arm-chair in the drawing-room.","I suggested a glass of water; but in\r\nspite of his pallor and the trembling of his hands, he refused it\r\nwith dignity. His get-up for the occasion was, by the way, extremely\r\nrecherch√©: a shirt of batiste and embroidered, almost fit for a ball, a\r\nwhite tie, a new hat in his hand, new straw-coloured gloves, and even a\r\nsuspicion of scent. We had hardly sat down when Shatov was shown in by\r\nthe butler, obviously also by official invitation.","Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nwas rising to shake hands with him, but Shatov, after looking\r\nattentively at us both, turned away into a corner, and sat down there\r\nwithout even nodding to us. Stepan Trofimovitch looked at me in dismay\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nWe sat like this for some minutes longer in complete silence. Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch suddenly began whispering something to me very quickly,\r\nbut I could not catch it; and indeed, he was so agitated himself that he\r\nbroke off without finishing.","The butler came in once more, ostensibly to\r\nset something straight on the table, more probably to take a look at us.\r\n\r\nShatov suddenly addressed him with a loud question:\r\n\r\n\"Alexey Yegorytch, do you know whether Darya Pavlovna has gone with\r\nher?\"\r\n\r\n\"Varvara Petrovna was pleased to drive to the cathedral alone, and Darya\r\nPavlovna was pleased to remain in her room upstairs, being indisposed,\"\r\nAlexey Yegorytch announced formally and reprovingly.","My poor friend again stole a hurried and agitated glance at me, so\r\nthat at last I turned away from him. Suddenly a carriage rumbled at the\r\nentrance, and some commotion at a distance in the house made us aware\r\nof the lady's return. We all leapt up from our easy chairs, but again\r\na surprise awaited us; we heard the noise of many footsteps, so our\r\nhostess must have returned not alone, and this certainly was rather\r\nstrange, since she had fixed that time herself.","Finally, we heard some\r\none come in with strange rapidity as though running, in a way that\r\nVarvara Petrovna could not have come in. And, all at once she almost\r\nflew into the room, panting and extremely agitated. After her a little\r\nlater and much more quickly Lizaveta Nikolaevna came in, and with her,\r\nhand in hand, Marya Timofyevna Lebyadkin! If I had seen this in my\r\ndreams, even then I should not have believed it.","To explain their utterly unexpected appearance, I must go back an\r\nhour and describe more in detail an extraordinary adventure which had\r\nbefallen Varvara Petrovna in church.\r\n\r\nIn the first place almost the whole town, that is, of course, all of the\r\nupper stratum of society, were assembled in the cathedral. It was known\r\nthat the governor's wife was to make her appearance there for the\r\nfirst time since her arrival amongst us.","I must mention that there were\r\nalready rumours that she was a free-thinker, and a follower of \"the new\r\nprinciples.\" All the ladies were also aware that she would be dressed\r\nwith magnificence and extraordinary elegance. And so the costumes of our\r\nladies were elaborate and gorgeous for the occasion.\r\n\r\nOnly Varvara Petrovna was modestly dressed in black as she always was,\r\nand had been for the last four years.","She had taken her usual place in\r\nchurch in the first row on the left, and a footman in livery had put\r\ndown a velvet cushion for her to kneel on; everything in fact, had been\r\nas usual. But it was noticed, too, that all through the service she\r\nprayed with extreme fervour. It was even asserted afterwards when people\r\nrecalled it, that she had had tears in her eyes. The service was over at\r\nlast, and our chief priest, Father Pavel, came out to deliver a solemn\r\nsermon.","We liked his sermons and thought very highly of them. We used\r\neven to try to persuade him to print them, but he never could make up\r\nhis mind to. On this occasion the sermon was a particularly long one.\r\n\r\nAnd behold, during the sermon a lady drove up to the church in an old\r\nfashioned hired droshky, that is, one in which the lady could only sit\r\nsideways, holding on to the driver's sash, shaking at every jolt like a\r\nblade of grass in the breeze.","Such droshkys are still to be seen in our\r\ntown. Stopping at the corner of the cathedral--for there were a number\r\nof carriages, and mounted police too, at the gates--the lady sprang out\r\nof the droshky and handed the driver four kopecks in silver.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it enough, Vanya?\" she cried, seeing his grimace. \"It's all I've\r\ngot,\" she added plaintively.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there, bless you. I took you without fixing the price,\" said the\r\ndriver with a hopeless gesture, and looking at her he added as though\r\nreflecting:\r\n\r\n\"And it would be a sin to take advantage of you too.","\"\r\n\r\nThen, thrusting his leather purse into his bosom, he touched up his\r\nhorse and drove off, followed by the jeers of the drivers standing near.\r\nJeers, and wonder too, followed the lady as she made her way to the\r\ncathedral gates, between the carriages and the footmen waiting for\r\ntheir masters to come out. And indeed, there certainly was something\r\nextraordinary and surprising to every one in such a person's suddenly\r\nappearing in the street among people.","She was painfully thin and she\r\nlimped, she was heavily powdered and rouged; her long neck was quite\r\nbare, she had neither kerchief nor pelisse; she had nothing on but an\r\nold dark dress in spite of the cold and windy, though bright, September\r\nday. She was bareheaded, and her hair was twisted up into a tiny knot,\r\nand on the right side of it was stuck an artificial rose, such as are\r\nused to dedicate cherubs sold in Palm week.","I had noticed just such a\r\none with a wreath of paper roses in a corner under the ikons when I was\r\nat Marya Timofyevna's the day before. To put a finishing-touch to it,\r\nthough the lady walked with modestly downcast eyes there was a sly and\r\nmerry smile on her face. If she had lingered a moment longer, she would\r\nperhaps not have been allowed to enter the cathedral. But she succeeded\r\nin slipping by, and entering the building, gradually pressed forward.","Though it was half-way through the sermon, and the dense crowd that\r\nfilled the cathedral was listening to it with absorbed and silent\r\nattention, yet several pairs of eyes glanced with curiosity and\r\namazement at the new-comer. She sank on to the floor, bowed her painted\r\nface down to it, lay there a long time, unmistakably weeping; but\r\nraising her head again and getting up from her knees, she soon\r\nrecovered, and was diverted.","Gaily and with evident and intense\r\nenjoyment she let her eyes rove over the faces, and over the walls\r\nof the cathedral. She looked with particular curiosity at some of the\r\nladies, even standing on tip-toe to look at them, and even laughed once\r\nor twice, giggling strangely. But the sermon was over, and they brought\r\nout the cross. The governor's wife was the first to go up to the cross,\r\nbut she stopped short two steps from it, evidently wishing to make way\r\nfor Varvara Petrovna, who, on her side, moved towards it quite directly\r\nas though she noticed no one in front of her.","There was an obvious and,\r\nin its way, clever malice implied in this extraordinary act of deference\r\non the part of the governor's wife; every one felt this; Varvara\r\nPetrovna must have felt it too; but she went on as before, apparently\r\nnoticing no one, and with the same unfaltering air of dignity kissed the\r\ncross, and at once turned to leave the cathedral. A footman in livery\r\ncleared the way for her, though every one stepped back spontaneously to\r\nlet her pass.","But just as she was going out, in the porch the closely\r\npacked mass of people blocked the way for a moment. Varvara Petrovna\r\nstood still, and suddenly a strange, extraordinary creature, the woman\r\nwith the paper rose on her head, squeezed through the people, and\r\nfell on her knees before her. Varvara Petrovna, who was not easily\r\ndisconcerted, especially in public, looked at her sternly and with\r\ndignity.","I hasten to observe here, as briefly as possible, that though Varvara\r\nPetrovna had become, it was said, excessively careful and even stingy,\r\nyet sometimes she was not sparing of money, especially for benevolent\r\nobjects. She was a member of a charitable society in the capital. In\r\nthe last famine year she had sent five hundred roubles to the chief\r\ncommittee for the relief of the sufferers, and people talked of it in\r\nthe town.","Moreover, just before the appointment of the new governor, she\r\nhad been on the very point of founding a local committee of ladies to\r\nassist the poorest mothers in the town and in the province. She\r\nwas severely censured among us for ambition; but Varvara Petrovna's\r\nwell-known strenuousness and, at the same time, her persistence nearly\r\ntriumphed over all obstacles. The society was almost formed, and the\r\noriginal idea embraced a wider and wider scope in the enthusiastic mind\r\nof the foundress.","She was already dreaming of founding a similar society\r\nin Moscow, and the gradual expansion of its influence over all the\r\nprovinces of Russia. And now, with the sudden change of governor,\r\neverything was at a standstill; and the new governor's wife had, it was\r\nsaid, already uttered in society some biting, and, what was worse, apt\r\nand sensible remarks about the impracticability of the fundamental idea\r\nof such a committee, which was, with additions of course, repeated to\r\nVarvara Petrovna.","God alone knows the secrets of men's hearts; but I\r\nimagine that Varvara Petrovna stood still now at the very cathedral\r\ngates positively with a certain pleasure, knowing that the governor's\r\nwife and, after her, all the congregation, would have to pass by\r\nimmediately, and \"let her see for herself how little I care what\r\nshe thinks, and what pointed things she says about the vanity of my\r\nbenevolence.","So much for all of you!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it my dear? What are you asking?\" said Varvara Petrovna,\r\nlooking more attentively at the kneeling woman before her, who gazed at\r\nher with a fearfully panic-stricken, shame-faced, but almost reverent\r\nexpression, and suddenly broke into the same strange giggle.\r\n\r\n\"What does she want? Who is she?\"\r\n\r\nVarvara Petrovna bent an imperious and inquiring gaze on all around her.","Every one was silent.\r\n\r\n\"You are unhappy? You are in need of help?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am in need.... I have come...\" faltered the \"unhappy\" creature, in a\r\nvoice broken with emotion. \"I have come only to kiss your hand....\"\r\n\r\nAgain she giggled. With the childish look with which little children\r\ncaress someone, begging for a favour, she stretched forward to seize\r\nVarvara Petrovna's hand, but, as though panic-stricken, drew her hands\r\nback.","\"Is that all you have come for?\" said Varvara Petrovna, with a\r\ncompassionate smile; but at once she drew her mother-of-pearl purse out\r\nof her pocket, took out a ten-rouble note and gave it to the unknown.\r\nThe latter took it. Varvara Petrovna was much interested and evidently\r\ndid not look upon her as an ordinary low-class beggar.\r\n\r\n\"I say, she gave her ten roubles!\" someone said in the crowd.","\"Let me kiss your hand,\" faltered the unknown, holding tight in the\r\nfingers of her left hand the corner of the ten-rouble note, which\r\nfluttered in the draught. Varvara Petrovna frowned slightly, and with\r\na serious, almost severe, face held out her hand. The cripple kissed it\r\nwith reverence. Her grateful eyes shone with positive ecstasy. At that\r\nmoment the governor's wife came up, and a whole crowd of ladies and high\r\nofficials flocked after her.","The governor's wife was forced to stand\r\nstill for a moment in the crush; many people stopped.\r\n\r\n\"You are trembling. Are you cold?\" Varvara Petrovna observed suddenly,\r\nand flinging off her pelisse which a footman caught in mid-air, she took\r\nfrom her own shoulders a very expensive black shawl, and with her own\r\nhands wrapped it round the bare neck of the still kneeling woman.\r\n\r\n\"But get up, get up from your knees I beg you!\"\r\n\r\nThe woman got up.","\"Where do you live? Is it possible no one knows where she lives?\"\r\nVarvara Petrovna glanced round impatiently again. But the crowd was\r\ndifferent now: she saw only the faces of acquaintances, people in\r\nsociety, surveying the scene, some with severe astonishment, others with\r\nsly curiosity and at the same time guileless eagerness for a sensation,\r\nwhile others positively laughed.\r\n\r\n\"I believe her name's Lebyadkin,\" a good-natured person volunteered at\r\nlast in answer to Varvara Petrovna.","It was our respectable and respected\r\nmerchant Andreev, a man in spectacles with a grey beard, wearing Russian\r\ndress and holding a high round hat in his hands. \"They live in the\r\nFilipovs' house in Bogoyavlensky Street.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lebyadkin? Filipovs' house? I have heard something.... Thank you, Nikon\r\nSemyonitch. But who is this Lebyadkin?\"\r\n\r\n\"He calls himself a captain, a man, it must be said, not over careful\r\nin his behaviour.","And no doubt this is his sister. She must have escaped\r\nfrom under control,\" Nikon Semyonitch went on, dropping his voice, and\r\nglancing significantly at Varvara Petrovna.\r\n\r\n\"I understand. Thank you, Nikon Semyonitch. Your name is Mlle.\r\nLebyadkin?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my name's not Lebyadkin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then perhaps your brother's name is Lebyadkin?\"\r\n\r\n\"My brother's name is Lebyadkin.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is what I'll do, I'll take you with me now, my dear, and you shall\r\nbe driven from me to your family.","Would you like to go with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ach, I should!\" cried Mlle. Lebyadkin, clasping her hands.\r\n\r\n\"Auntie, auntie, take me with you too!\" the voice of Lizaveta Nikolaevna\r\ncried suddenly.\r\n\r\nI must observe that Lizaveta Nikolaevna had come to the cathedral with\r\nthe governor's wife, while Praskovya Ivanovna had by the doctor's\r\norders gone for a drive in her carriage, taking Mavriky Nikolaevitch\r\nto entertain her.","Liza suddenly left the governor's wife and ran up to\r\nVarvara Petrovna.\r\n\r\n\"My dear, you know I'm always glad to have you, but what will your\r\nmother say?\" Varvara Petrovna began majestically, but she became\r\nsuddenly confused, noticing Liza's extraordinary agitation.\r\n\r\n\"Auntie, auntie, I must come with you!\" Liza implored, kissing Varvara\r\nPetrovna.\r\n\r\n_\"Mais qu'avez vous donc, Lise?\"_ the governor's wife asked with\r\nexpressive wonder.","\"Ah, forgive me, darling, _ch√®re cousine,_ I'm going to auntie's.\"\r\n\r\nLiza turned in passing to her unpleasantly surprised _ch√®re cousine_, and\r\nkissed her twice.\r\n\r\n\"And tell maman to follow me to auntie's directly; maman meant, fully\r\nmeant to come and see you, she said so this morning herself, I forgot to\r\ntell you,\" Liza pattered on. \"I beg your pardon, don't be angry, _Julie,\r\nch√®re...cousine.","..._Auntie, I'm ready!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you don't take me with you, auntie, I'll run after your carriage,\r\nscreaming,\" she whispered rapidly and despairingly in Varvara Petrovna's\r\near; it was lucky that no one heard. Varvara Petrovna positively\r\nstaggered back, and bent her penetrating gaze on the mad girl. That gaze\r\nsettled everything. She made up her mind to take Liza with her.\r\n\r\n\"We must put an end to this!\" broke from her lips.","\"Very well, I'll\r\ntake you with pleasure, Liza,\" she added aloud, \"if Yulia Mihailovna\r\nis willing to let you come, of course.\" With a candid air and\r\nstraightforward dignity she addressed the governor's wife directly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, certainly, I don't want to deprive her of such a pleasure\r\nespecially as I am myself...\" Yulia Mihailovna lisped with amazing\r\naffability--\"I myself... know well what a fantastic, wilful little head\r\nit is!\" Yulia Mihailovna gave a charming smile.","\"I thank you extremely,\" said Varvara Petrovna, with a courteous and\r\ndignified bow.\r\n\r\n\"And I am the more gratified,\" Yulia Mihailovna went on, lisping almost\r\nrapturously, flushing all over with agreeable excitement, \"that, apart\r\nfrom the pleasure of being with you Liza should be carried away by such\r\nan excellent, I may say lofty, feeling... of compassion...\" (she\r\nglanced at the \"unhappy creature\") \"and.",".. and at the very portal of the\r\ntemple....\"\r\n\r\n\"Such a feeling does you honour,\" Varvara Petrovna approved\r\nmagnificently. Yulia Mihailovna impulsively held out her hand and\r\nVarvara Petrovna with perfect readiness touched it with her fingers. The\r\ngeneral effect was excellent, the faces of some of those present beamed\r\nwith pleasure, some bland and insinuating smiles were to be seen.\r\n\r\nIn short it was made manifest to every one in the town that it was not\r\nYulia Mihailovna who had up till now neglected Varvara Petrovna in not\r\ncalling upon her, but on the contrary that Varvara Petrovna had \"kept\r\nYulia Mihailovna within bounds at a distance, while the latter would\r\nhave hastened to pay her a visit, going on foot perhaps if necessary,\r\nhad she been fully assured that Varvara Petrovna would not turn her\r\naway.","\" And Varvara Petrovna's prestige was enormously increased.\r\n\r\n\"Get in, my dear.\" Varvara Petrovna motioned Mlle. Lebyadkin towards the\r\ncarriage which had driven up.\r\n\r\nThe \"unhappy creature\" hurried gleefully to the carriage door, and there\r\nthe footman lifted her in.\r\n\r\n\"What! You're lame!\" cried Varvara Petrovna, seeming quite alarmed,\r\nand she turned pale. (Every one noticed it at the time, but did not\r\nunderstand it.",")\r\n\r\nThe carriage rolled away. Varvara Petrovna's house was very near\r\nthe cathedral. Liza told me afterwards that Miss Lebyadkin laughed\r\nhysterically for the three minutes that the drive lasted, while Varvara\r\nPetrovna sat \"as though in a mesmeric sleep.\" Liza's own expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. THE SUBTLE SERPENT\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nVARVARA PETROVNA rang the bell and threw herself into an easy chair by\r\nthe window.","\"Sit here, my dear.\" She motioned Marya Timofyevna to a seat in the\r\nmiddle of the room, by a large round table. \"Stepan Trofimovitch,\r\nwhat is the meaning of this? See, see, look at this woman, what is the\r\nmeaning of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I... I...\" faltered Stepan Trofimovitch.\r\n\r\nBut a footman came in.\r\n\r\n\"A cup of coffee at once, we must have it as quickly as possible! Keep\r\nthe horses!\"\r\n\r\n_\"Mais, ch√®re et excellente amie, dans quelle inqui√©tude.","..\"_ Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch exclaimed in a dying voice.\r\n\r\n\"Ach! French! French! I can see at once that it's the highest society,\"\r\ncried Marya Timofyevna, clapping her hands, ecstatically preparing\r\nherself to listen to a conversation in French. Varvara Petrovna stared\r\nat her almost in dismay.\r\n\r\nWe all sat in silence, waiting to see how it would end. Shatov did not\r\nlift up his head, and Stepan Trofimovitch was overwhelmed with confusion\r\nas though it were all his fault; the perspiration stood out on his\r\ntemples.","I glanced at Liza (she was sitting in the corner almost beside\r\nShatov). Her eyes darted keenly from Varvara Petrovna to the cripple and\r\nback again; her lips were drawn into a smile, but not a pleasant\r\none. Varvara Petrovna saw that smile. Meanwhile Marya Timofyevna was\r\nabsolutely transported. With evident enjoyment and without a trace\r\nof embarrassment she stared at Varvara Petrovna's beautiful\r\ndrawing-room--the furniture, the carpets, the pictures on the walls, the\r\nold-fashioned painted ceiling, the great bronze crucifix in the corner,\r\nthe china lamp, the albums, the objects on the table.","\"And you're here, too, Shatushka!\" she cried suddenly. \"Only fancy, I\r\nsaw you a long time ago, but I thought it couldn't be you! How could you\r\ncome here!\" And she laughed gaily.\r\n\r\n\"You know this woman?\" said Varvara Petrovna, turning to him at once.\r\n\r\n\"I know her,\" muttered Shatov. He seemed about to move from his chair,\r\nbut remained sitting.\r\n\r\n\"What do you know of her? Make haste, please!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well.","..\" he stammered with an incongruous smile. \"You see for\r\nyourself....\"\r\n\r\n\"What do I see? Come now, say something!\"\r\n\r\n\"She lives in the same house as I do... with her brother... an officer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\nShatov stammered again.\r\n\r\n\"It's not worth talking about...\" he muttered, and relapsed into\r\ndetermined silence. He positively flushed with determination.\r\n\r\n\"Of course one can expect nothing else from you,\" said Varvara Petrovna\r\nindignantly.","It was clear to her now that they all knew something and,\r\nat the same time, that they were all scared, that they were evading her\r\nquestions, and anxious to keep something from her.\r\n\r\nThe footman came in and brought her, on a little silver tray, the cup of\r\ncoffee she had so specially ordered, but at a sign from her moved with\r\nit at once towards Marya Timofyevna.\r\n\r\n\"You were very cold just now, my dear; make haste and drink it and get\r\nwarm.","\"\r\n\r\n_\"Merci.\"_\r\n\r\nMarya Timofyevna took the cup and at once went off into a giggle\r\nat having said _merci_ to the footman. But meeting Varvara Petrovna's\r\nreproving eyes, she was overcome with shyness and put the cup on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\"Auntie, surely you're not angry?\" she faltered with a sort of flippant\r\nplayfulness.\r\n\r\n\"Wh-a-a-t?\" Varvara Petrovna started, and drew herself up in her chair.\r\n\"I'm not your aunt.","What are you thinking of?\"\r\n\r\nMarya Timofyevna, not expecting such an angry outburst, began trembling\r\nall over in little convulsive shudders, as though she were in a fit, and\r\nsank back in her chair.\r\n\r\n\"I... I... thought that was the proper way,\" she faltered, gazing\r\nopen-eyed at Varvara Petrovna. \"Liza called you that.\"\r\n\r\n\"What Liza?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, this young lady here,\" said Marya Timofyevna, pointing with her\r\nfinger.","\"So she's Liza already?\"\r\n\r\n\"You called her that yourself just now,\" said Marya Timofyevna growing\r\na little bolder. \"And I dreamed of a beauty like that,\" she added,\r\nlaughing, as it were accidentally.\r\n\r\nVarvara Petrovna reflected, and grew calmer, she even smiled faintly at\r\nMarya Timofyevna's last words; the latter, catching her smile, got up\r\nfrom her chair, and limping, went timidly towards her.","\"Take it. I forgot to give it back. Don't be angry with my rudeness.\"\r\n\r\nShe took from her shoulders the black shawl that Varvara Petrovna had\r\nwrapped round her.\r\n\r\n\"Put it on again at once, and you can keep it always. Go and sit down,\r\ndrink your coffee, and please don't be afraid of me, my dear, don't\r\nworry yourself. I am beginning to understand you.\"\r\n\r\n_\"Ch√®re amie...\"_ Stepan Trofimovitch ventured again.","\"Ach, Stepan Trofimovitch, it's bewildering enough without you. You\r\nmight at least spare me.... Please ring that bell there, near you, to\r\nthe maid's room.\"\r\n\r\nA silence followed. Her eyes strayed irritably and suspiciously over all\r\nour faces. Agasha, her favourite maid, came in.\r\n\r\n\"Bring me my check shawl, the one I bought in Geneva. What's Darya\r\nPavlovna doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"She's not very well, madam.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Go and ask her to come here. Say that I want her particularly, even if\r\nshe's not well.\"\r\n\r\nAt that instant there was again, as before, an unusual noise of steps\r\nand voices in the next room, and suddenly Praskovya Ivanovna, panting\r\nand \"distracted,\" appeared in the doorway. She was leaning on the arm of\r\nMavriky Nikolaevitch.\r\n\r\n\"Ach, heavens, I could scarcely drag myself here. Liza, you mad girl,\r\nhow you treat your mother!\" she squeaked, concentrating in that squeak,\r\nas weak and irritable people are wont to do, all her accumulated\r\nirritability.","\"Varvara Petrovna, I've come for my daughter!\"\r\n\r\nVarvara Petrovna looked at her from under her brows, half rose to meet\r\nher, and scarcely concealing her vexation brought out: \"Good morning,\r\nPraskovya Ivanovna, please be seated, I knew you would come!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThere could be nothing surprising to Praskovya Ivanovna in such a\r\nreception. Varvara Petrovna had from childhood upwards treated her\r\nold school friend tyrannically, and under a show of friendship almost\r\ncontemptuously.","And this was an exceptional occasion too. During the\r\nlast few days there had almost been a complete rupture between the two\r\nhouseholds, as I have mentioned incidentally already. The reason of this\r\nrupture was still a mystery to Varvara Petrovna, which made it all\r\nthe more offensive; but the chief cause of offence was that Praskovya\r\nIvanovna had succeeded in taking up an extraordinarily supercilious\r\nattitude towards Varvara Petrovna.","Varvara Petrovna was wounded of\r\ncourse, and meanwhile some strange rumours had reached her which also\r\nirritated her extremely, especially by their vagueness. Varvara Petrovna\r\nwas of a direct and proudly frank character, somewhat slap-dash in her\r\nmethods, indeed, if the expression is permissible. There was nothing\r\nshe detested so much as secret and mysterious insinuations, she always\r\npreferred war in the open.","Anyway, the two ladies had not met for five\r\ndays. The last visit had been paid by Varvara Petrovna, who had come\r\nback from \"that Drozdov woman\" offended and perplexed. I can say with\r\ncertainty that Praskovya Ivanovna had come on this occasion with the\r\nna√Øve conviction that Varvara Petrovna would, for some reason, be sure\r\nto stand in awe of her. This was evident from the very expression of her\r\nface.","Evidently too, Varvara Petrovna was always possessed by a demon of\r\nhaughty pride whenever she had the least ground for suspecting that she\r\nwas for some reason supposed to be humiliated. Like many weak people,\r\nwho for a long time allow themselves to be insulted without resenting\r\nit, Praskovya Ivanovna showed an extraordinary violence in her attack at\r\nthe first favourable opportunity. It is true that she was not well, and\r\nalways became more irritable in illness.","I must add finally, that our\r\npresence in the drawing-room could hardly be much check to the two\r\nladies who had been friends from childhood, if a quarrel had broken out\r\nbetween them. We were looked upon as friends of the family, and almost\r\nas their subjects. I made that reflection with some alarm at the time.\r\nStepan Trofimovitch, who had not sat down since the entrance of Varvara\r\nPetrovna, sank helplessly into an arm-chair on hearing Praskovya\r\nIvanovna's squeal, and tried to catch my eye with a look of despair.","Shatov turned sharply in his chair, and growled something to himself.\r\nI believe he meant to get up and go away. Liza rose from her chair but\r\nsank back again at once without even paying befitting attention to her\r\nmother's squeal--not from \"waywardness,\" but obviously because she\r\nwas entirely absorbed by some other overwhelming impression. She was\r\nlooking absent-mindedly into the air, no longer noticing even Marya\r\nTimofyevna.","III\r\n\r\n\"Ach, here!\" Praskovya Ivanovna indicated an easy chair near the table\r\nand sank heavily into it with the assistance of Mavriky Nikolaevitch.\r\n\"I wouldn't have sat down in your house, my lady, if it weren't for my\r\nlegs,\" she added in a breaking voice.\r\n\r\nVarvara Petrovna raised her head a little, and with an expression of\r\nsuffering pressed the fingers of her right hand to her right temple,\r\nevidently in acute pain _(tic douloureux)_.","\"Why so, Praskovya Ivanovna; why wouldn't you sit down in my house? I\r\npossessed your late husband's sincere friendship all his life; and you\r\nand I used to play with our dolls at school together as girls.\"\r\n\r\nPraskovya Ivanovna waved her hands.\r\n\r\n\"I knew that was coming! You always begin about the school when you want\r\nto reproach me--that's your way. But to my thinking that's only fine\r\ntalk.","I can't stand the school you're always talking about.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've come in rather a bad temper, I'm afraid; how are your legs? Here\r\nthey're bringing you some coffee, please have some, drink it and don't\r\nbe cross.\"\r\n\r\n\"Varvara Petrovna, you treat me as though I were a child. I won't have\r\nany coffee, so there!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she pettishly waved away the footman who was bringing her coffee.\r\n(All the others refused coffee too except Mavriky Nikolaevitch and me.","Stepan Trofimovitch took it, but put it aside on the table. Though Marya\r\nTimofyevna was very eager to have another cup and even put out her hand\r\nto take it, on second thoughts she refused it ceremoniously, and was\r\nobviously pleased with herself for doing so.)\r\n\r\nVarvara Petrovna gave a wry smile.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what it is, Praskovya Ivanovna, my friend, you must\r\nhave taken some fancy into your head again, and that's why you've come.","You've simply lived on fancies all your life. You flew into a fury at\r\nthe mere mention of our school; but do you remember how you came and\r\npersuaded all the class that a hussar called Shablykin had proposed to\r\nyou, and how Mme. Lefebure proved on the spot you were lying. Yet you\r\nweren't lying, you were simply imagining it all to amuse yourself. Come,\r\ntell me, what is it now? What are you fancying now; what is it vexes\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"And you fell in love with the priest who used to teach us scripture at\r\nschool--so much for you, since you've such a spiteful memory.","Ha ha ha!\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed viciously and went off into a fit of coughing.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you've not forgotten the priest then...\" said Varvara Petrovna,\r\nlooking at her vindictively.\r\n\r\nHer face turned green. Praskovya Ivanovna suddenly assumed a dignified\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\"I'm in no laughing mood now, madam. Why have you drawn my daughter\r\ninto your scandals in the face of the whole town? That's what I've come\r\nabout.","\"\r\n\r\n\"My scandals?\" Varvara Petrovna drew herself up menacingly.\r\n\r\n\"Maman, I entreat you too, to restrain yourself,\" Lizaveta Nikolaevna\r\nbrought out suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"What's that you say?\" The maman was on the point of breaking into a\r\nsqueal again, but catching her daughter's flashing eye, she subsided\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n\"How could you talk about scandal, maman?\" cried Liza, flushing red.\r\n\"I came of my own accord with Yulia Mihailovna's permission, because I\r\nwanted to learn this unhappy woman's story and to be of use to her.","\"\r\n\r\n\"This unhappy woman's story!\" Praskovya Ivanovna drawled with a spiteful\r\nlaugh. \"Is it your place to mix yourself up with such 'stories.' Ach,\r\nenough of your tyrannising!\" She turned furiously to Varvara Petrovna.\r\n\"I don't know whether it's true or not, they say you keep the whole town\r\nin order, but it seems your turn has come at last.\"\r\n\r\nVarvara Petrovna sat straight as an arrow ready to fly from the bow.","For\r\nten seconds she looked sternly and immovably at Praskovya Ivanovna.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Praskovya, you must thank God that all here present are our\r\nfriends,\" she said at last with ominous composure. \"You've said a great\r\ndeal better unsaid.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I'm not so much afraid of what the world will say, my lady, as\r\nsome people. It's you who, under a show of pride, are trembling at what\r\npeople will say. And as for all here being your friends, it's better for\r\nyou than if strangers had been listening.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you grown wiser during this last week?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not that I've grown wiser, but simply that the truth has come out\r\nthis week.\"\r\n\r\n\"What truth has come out this week? Listen, Praskovya Ivanovna, don't\r\nirritate me. Explain to me this minute, I beg you as a favour, what\r\ntruth has come out and what do you mean by that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why there it is, sitting before you!\" and Praskovya Ivanovna suddenly\r\npointed at Marya Timofyevna with that desperate determination which\r\ntakes no heed of consequences, if only it can make an impression at\r\nthe moment.","Marya Timofyevna, who had watched her all the time with\r\nlight-hearted curiosity, laughed exultingly at the sight of the wrathful\r\nguest's finger pointed impetuously at her, and wriggled gleefully in her\r\neasy chair.\r\n\r\n\"God Almighty have mercy on us, they've all gone crazy!\" exclaimed\r\nVarvara Petrovna, and turning pale she sank back in her chair.\r\n\r\nShe turned so pale that it caused some commotion.","Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nwas the first to rush up to her. I drew near also; even Liza got up from\r\nher seat, though she did not come forward. But the most alarmed of all\r\nwas Praskovya Ivanovna herself. She uttered a scream, got up as far as\r\nshe could and almost wailed in a lachrymose voice:\r\n\r\n\"Varvara Petrovna, dear, forgive me for my wicked foolishness! Give her\r\nsome water, somebody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't whimper, please, Praskovya Ivanovna, and leave me alone,\r\ngentlemen, please, I don't want any water!\" Varvara Petrovna pronounced\r\nin a firm though low voice, with blanched lips.","\"Varvara Petrovna, my dear,\" Praskovya Ivanovna went on, a little\r\nreassured, \"though I am to blame for my reckless words, what's upset me\r\nmore than anything are these anonymous letters that some low creatures\r\nkeep bombarding me with; they might write to you, since it concerns you,\r\nbut I've a daughter!\"\r\n\r\nVarvara Petrovna looked at her in silence, with wide-open eyes,\r\nlistening with wonder.","At that moment a side-door in the corner opened\r\nnoiselessly, and Darya Pavlovna made her appearance. She stood still and\r\nlooked round. She was struck by our perturbation. Probably she did not\r\nat first distinguish Marya Timofyevna, of whose presence she had not\r\nbeen informed. Stepan Trofimovitch was the first to notice her; he made\r\na rapid movement, turned red, and for some reason proclaimed in a loud\r\nvoice: \"Darya Pavlovna!\" so that all eyes turned on the new-comer.","\"Oh, is this your Darya Pavlovna!\" cried Marya Timofyevna. \"Well,\r\nShatushka, your sister's not like you. How can my fellow call such a\r\ncharmer the serf-wench Dasha?\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Darya Pavlovna had gone up to Varvara Petrovna, but struck\r\nby Marya Timofyevna's exclamation she turned quickly and stopped just\r\nbefore her chair, looking at the imbecile with a long fixed gaze.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, Dasha,\" Varvara Petrovna brought out with terrifying\r\ncomposure.","\"Nearer, that's right. You can see this woman, sitting down.\r\nDo you know her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never seen her,\" Dasha answered quietly, and after a pause she\r\nadded at once:\r\n\r\n\"She must be the invalid sister of Captain Lebyadkin.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it's the first time I've set eyes on you, my love, though I've been\r\ninterested and wanted to know you a long time, for I see how\r\nwell-bred you are in every movement you make,\" Marya Timofyevna cried\r\nenthusiastically.","\"And though my footman swears at you, can such a\r\nwell-educated charming person as you really have stolen money from\r\nhim? For you are sweet, sweet, sweet, I tell you that from myself!\" she\r\nconcluded, enthusiastically waving her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Can you make anything of it?\" Varvara Petrovna asked with proud\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\n\"I understand it....\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you heard about the money?\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt it's the money that I undertook at Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch's\r\nrequest to hand over to her brother, Captain Lebyadkin.","\"\r\n\r\nA silence followed.\r\n\r\n\"Did Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch himself ask you to do so?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was very anxious to send that money, three hundred roubles, to Mr.\r\nLebyadkin. And as he didn't know his address, but only knew that he\r\nwas to be in our town, he charged me to give it to Mr. Lebyadkin if he\r\ncame.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the money... lost? What was this woman speaking about just\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I don't know.","I've heard before that Mr. Lebyadkin says I didn't\r\ngive him all the money, but I don't understand his words. There were\r\nthree hundred roubles and I sent him three hundred roubles.\"\r\n\r\nDarya Pavlovna had almost completely regained her composure. And it was\r\ndifficult, I may mention, as a rule, to astonish the girl or ruffle her\r\ncalm for long--whatever she might be feeling. She brought out all her\r\nanswers now without haste, replied immediately to every question with\r\naccuracy, quietly, smoothly, and without a trace of the sudden emotion\r\nshe had shown at first, or the slightest embarrassment which might\r\nhave suggested a consciousness of guilt.","Varvara Petrovna's eyes were\r\nfastened upon her all the time she was speaking. Varvara Petrovna\r\nthought for a minute:\r\n\r\n\"If,\" she pronounced at last firmly, evidently addressing all present,\r\nthough she only looked at Dasha, \"if Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch\r\ndid not appeal even to me but asked you to do this for him,\r\nhe must have had his reasons for doing so. I don't consider I have\r\nany right to inquire into them, if they are kept secret from me.","But the\r\nvery fact of your having taken part in the matter reassures me on that\r\nscore, be sure of that, Darya, in any case. But you see, my dear, you\r\nmay, through ignorance of the world, have quite innocently done\r\nsomething imprudent; and you did so when you undertook to have dealings\r\nwith a low character. The rumours spread by this rascal show what a\r\nmistake you made. But I will find out about him, and as it is my task to\r\nprotect you, I shall know how to defend you.","But now all this must be\r\nput a stop to.\"\r\n\r\n\"The best thing to do,\" said Marya Timofyevna, popping up from her\r\nchair, \"is to send him to the footmen's room when he comes. Let him\r\nsit on the benches there and play cards with them while we sit here and\r\ndrink coffee. We might send him a cup of coffee too, but I have a great\r\ncontempt for him.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she wagged her head expressively.\r\n\r\n\"We must put a stop to this,\" Varvara Petrovna repeated, listening\r\nattentively to Marya Timofyevna.","\"Ring, Stepan Trofimovitch, I beg you.\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch rang, and suddenly stepped forward, all excitement.\r\n\r\n\"If... if...\" he faltered feverishly, flushing, breaking off and\r\nstuttering, \"if I too have heard the most revolting story, or rather\r\nslander, it was with utter indignation..._enfin c'est un homme perdu, et\r\nquelque chose comme un for√ßat evad√©...._\"\r\n\r\nHe broke down and could not go on.","Varvara Petrovna, screwing up her\r\neyes, looked him up and down.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonious butler Alexey Yegorytch came in.\r\n\r\n\"The carriage,\" Varvara Petrovna ordered. \"And you, Alexey Yegorytch,\r\nget ready to escort Miss Lebyadkin home; she will give you the address\r\nherself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lebyadkin has been waiting for her for some time downstairs, and\r\nhas been begging me to announce him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's impossible, Varvara Petrovna!\" and Mavriky Nikolaevitch, who had\r\nsat all the time in unbroken silence, suddenly came forward in alarm.","\"If I may speak, he is not a man who can be admitted into society.\r\nHe... he... he's an impossible person, Varvara Petrovna!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment,\" said Varvara Petrovna to Alexey Yegorytch, and he\r\ndisappeared at once.\r\n\r\n_\"C'est un homme malhonn√™te et je crois m√™me que c'est un for√ßat evad√©\r\nou quelque chose dans ce genre,\"_ Stepan Trofimovitch muttered again, and\r\nagain he flushed red and broke off.","\"Liza, it's time we were going,\" announced Praskovya Ivanovna\r\ndisdainfully, getting up from her seat. She seemed sorry that in her\r\nalarm she had called herself a fool. While Darya Pavlovna was speaking,\r\nshe listened, pressing her lips superciliously. But what struck me most\r\nwas the expression of Lizaveta Nikolaevna from the moment Darya Pavlovna\r\nhad come in. There was a gleam of hatred and hardly disguised contempt\r\nin her eyes.","\"Wait one minute, Praskovya Ivanovna, I beg you.\" Varvara Petrovna\r\ndetained her, still with the same exaggerated composure. \"Kindly sit\r\ndown. I intend to speak out, and your legs are bad. That's right, thank\r\nyou. I lost my temper just now and uttered some impatient words. Be so\r\ngood as to forgive me. I behaved foolishly and I'm the first to regret\r\nit, because I like fairness in everything.","Losing your temper too,\r\nof course, you spoke of certain anonymous letters. Every anonymous\r\ncommunication is deserving of contempt, just because it's not signed. If\r\nyou think differently I'm sorry for you. In any case, if I were in your\r\nplace, I would not pry into such dirty corners, I would not soil my\r\nhands with it. But you have soiled yours. However, since you have\r\nbegun on the subject yourself, I must tell you that six days ago I too\r\nreceived a clownish anonymous letter.","In it some rascal informs me that\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch has gone out of his mind, and that I have reason\r\nto fear some lame woman, who 'is destined to play a great part in\r\nmy life.' I remember the expression. Reflecting and being aware that\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch has very numerous enemies, I promptly sent for a\r\nman living here, one of his secret enemies, and the most vindictive and\r\ncontemptible of them, and from my conversation with him I gathered what\r\nwas the despicable source of the anonymous letter.","If you too, my poor\r\nPraskovya Ivanovna, have been worried by similar letters on my account,\r\nand as you say 'bombarded' with them, I am, of course, the first to\r\nregret having been the innocent cause of it. That's all I wanted to tell\r\nyou by way of explanation. I'm very sorry to see that you are so\r\ntired and so upset. Besides, I have quite made up my mind to see that\r\nsuspicious personage of whom Mavriky Nikolaevitch said just now, a\r\nlittle inappropriately, that it was impossible to receive him.","Liza in\r\nparticular need have nothing to do with it. Come to me, Liza, my dear,\r\nlet me kiss you again.\"\r\n\r\nLiza crossed the room and stood in silence before Varvara Petrovna. The\r\nlatter kissed her, took her hands, and, holding her at arm's-length,\r\nlooked at her with feeling, then made the sign of the cross over her and\r\nkissed her again.\r\n\r\n\"Well, good-bye, Liza\" (there was almost the sound of tears in Varvara\r\nPetrovna's voice), \"believe that I shall never cease to love you\r\nwhatever fate has in store for you.","God be with you. I have always\r\nblessed His Holy Will....\"\r\n\r\nShe would have added something more, but restrained herself and broke\r\noff. Liza was walking back to her place, still in the same silence, as\r\nit were plunged in thought, but she suddenly stopped before her mother.\r\n\r\n\"I am not going yet, mother. I'll stay a little longer at auntie's,\" she\r\nbrought out in a low voice, but there was a note of iron determination\r\nin those quiet words.","\"My goodness! What now?\" wailed Praskovya Ivanovna, clasping her hands\r\nhelplessly. But Liza did not answer, and seemed indeed not to hear her;\r\nshe sat down in the same corner and fell to gazing into space again as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThere was a look of pride and triumph in Varvara Petrovna's face.\r\n\r\n\"Mavriky Nikolaevitch, I have a great favour to ask of you. Be so kind\r\nas to go and take a look at that person downstairs, and if there is any\r\npossibility of admitting him, bring him up here.","\"\r\n\r\nMavriky Nikolaevitch bowed and went out. A moment later he brought in\r\nMr. Lebyadkin.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nI have said something of this gentleman's outward appearance. He was a\r\ntall, curly-haired, thick-set fellow about forty with a purplish, rather\r\nbloated and flabby face, with cheeks that quivered at every movement of\r\nhis head, with little bloodshot eyes that were sometimes rather crafty,\r\nwith moustaches and side-whiskers, and with an incipient double chin,\r\nfleshy and rather unpleasant-looking.","But what was most striking about\r\nhim was the fact that he appeared now wearing a dress-coat and clean\r\nlinen.\r\n\r\n\"There are people on whom clean linen is almost unseemly,\" as Liputin\r\nhad once said when Stepan Trofimovitch reproached him in jest for being\r\nuntidy. The captain had perfectly new black gloves too, of which he\r\nheld the right one in his hand, while the left, tightly stretched and\r\nunbuttoned, covered part of the huge fleshy fist in which he held a\r\nbrand-new, glossy round hat, probably worn for the first time that day.","It appeared therefore that \"the garb of love,\" of which he had shouted\r\nto Shatov the day before, really did exist. All this, that is, the\r\ndress-coat and clean linen, had been procured by Liputin's advice with\r\nsome mysterious object in view (as I found out later). There was no\r\ndoubt that his coming now (in a hired carriage) was at the instigation\r\nand with the assistance of someone else; it would never have dawned on\r\nhim, nor could he by himself have succeeded in dressing, getting ready\r\nand making up his mind in three-quarters of an hour, even if the scene\r\nin the porch of the cathedral had reached his ears at once.","He was not\r\ndrunk, but was in the dull, heavy, dazed condition of a man suddenly\r\nawakened after many days of drinking. It seemed as though he would be\r\ndrunk again if one were to put one's hands on his shoulders and rock\r\nhim to and fro once or twice. He was hurrying into the drawing-room but\r\nstumbled over a rug near the doorway. Marya Timofyevna was helpless with\r\nlaughter. He looked savagely at her and suddenly took a few rapid steps\r\ntowards Varvara Petrovna.","\"I have come, madam...\" he blared out like a trumpet-blast.\r\n\r\n\"Be so good, sir, as to take a seat there, on that chair,\" said Varvara\r\nPetrovna, drawing herself up. \"I shall hear you as well from there, and\r\nit will be more convenient for me to look at you from here.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain stopped short, looking blankly before him. He turned,\r\nhowever, and sat down on the seat indicated close to the door.","An\r\nextreme lack of self-confidence and at the same time insolence, and a\r\nsort of incessant irritability, were apparent in the expression of his\r\nface. He was horribly scared, that was evident, but his self-conceit\r\nwas wounded, and it might be surmised that his mortified vanity might on\r\noccasion lead him to any effrontery, in spite of his cowardice. He was\r\nevidently uneasy at every movement of his clumsy person.","We all know\r\nthat when such gentlemen are brought by some marvellous chance into\r\nsociety, they find their worst ordeal in their own hands, and the\r\nimpossibility of disposing them becomingly, of which they are conscious\r\nat every moment. The captain sat rigid in his chair, with his hat and\r\ngloves in his hands and his eyes fixed with a senseless stare on the\r\nstern face of Varvara Petrovna. He would have liked, perhaps, to have\r\nlooked about more freely, but he could not bring himself to do so yet.","Marya Timofyevna, apparently thinking his appearance very funny, laughed\r\nagain, but he did not stir. Varvara Petrovna ruthlessly kept him in this\r\nposition for a long time, a whole minute, staring at him without mercy.\r\n\r\n\"In the first place allow me to learn your name from yourself,\" Varvara\r\nPetrovna pronounced in measured and impressive tones.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Lebyadkin,\" thundered the captain. \"I have come, madam.","..\" He\r\nmade a movement again.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me!\" Varvara Petrovna checked him again. \"Is this unfortunate\r\nperson who interests me so much really your sister?\"\r\n\r\n\"My sister, madam, who has escaped from control, for she is in a certain\r\ncondition....\"\r\n\r\nHe suddenly faltered and turned crimson. \"Don't misunderstand me,\r\nmadam,\" he said, terribly confused. \"Her own brother's not going to\r\nthrow mud at her.",".. in a certain condition doesn't mean in such a\r\ncondition... in the sense of an injured reputation... in the last\r\nstage...\" he suddenly broke off.\r\n\r\n\"Sir!\" said Varvara Petrovna, raising her head.\r\n\r\n\"In this condition!\" he concluded suddenly, tapping the middle of his\r\nforehead with his finger.\r\n\r\nA pause followed.\r\n\r\n\"And has she suffered in this way for long?\" asked Varvara Petrovna,\r\nwith a slight drawl.","\"Madam, I have come to thank you for the generosity you showed in the\r\nporch, in a Russian, brotherly way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brotherly?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, not brotherly, but simply in the sense that I am my sister's\r\nbrother; and believe me, madam,\" he went on more hurriedly, turning\r\ncrimson again, \"I am not so uneducated as I may appear at first sight in\r\nyour drawing-room. My sister and I are nothing, madam, compared with the\r\nluxury we observe here.","Having enemies who slander us, besides. But on\r\nthe question of reputation Lebyadkin is proud, madam... and... and ...\r\nand I've come to repay with thanks.... Here is money, madam!\"\r\n\r\nAt this point he pulled out a pocket-book, drew out of it a bundle of\r\nnotes, and began turning them over with trembling fingers in a perfect\r\nfury of impatience. It was evident that he was in haste to explain\r\nsomething, and indeed it was quite necessary to do so.","But probably\r\nfeeling himself that his fluster with the money made him look even more\r\nfoolish, he lost the last traces of self-possession. The money refused\r\nto be counted. His fingers fumbled helplessly, and to complete his shame\r\na green note escaped from the pocket-book, and fluttered in zigzags on\r\nto the carpet.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty roubles, madam.\" He leapt up suddenly with the roll of notes in\r\nhis hand, his face perspiring with discomfort.","Noticing the note which\r\nhad dropped on the floor, he was bending down to pick it up, but for\r\nsome reason overcome by shame, he dismissed it with a wave.\r\n\r\n\"For your servants, madam; for the footman who picks it up. Let them\r\nremember my sister!\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot allow that,\" Varvara Petrovna brought out hurriedly, even with\r\nsome alarm.\r\n\r\n\"In that case...\"\r\n\r\nHe bent down, picked it up, flushing crimson, and suddenly going up to\r\nVarvara Petrovna held out the notes he had counted.","\"What's this?\" she cried, really alarmed at last, and positively\r\nshrinking back in her chair.\r\n\r\nMavriky Nikolaevitch, Stepan Trofimovitch, and I all stepped forward.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be alarmed, don't be alarmed; I'm not mad, by God, I'm not mad,\"\r\nthe captain kept asseverating excitedly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, you're out of your senses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam, she's not at all as you suppose. I am an insignificant link.","Oh, madam, wealthy are your mansions, but poor is the dwelling of Marya\r\nAnonyma, my sister, whose maiden name was Lebyadkin, but whom we'll call\r\nAnonyma for the time, only for _the time,_ madam, for God Himself will\r\nnot suffer it forever. Madam, you gave her ten roubles and she took it,\r\nbecause it was from _you,_ madam! Do you hear, madam? From no one else\r\nin the world would this Marya Anonyma take it, or her grandfather, the\r\nofficer killed in the Caucasus before the very eyes of Yermolov, would\r\nturn in his grave.","But from you, madam, from you she will take anything.\r\nBut with one hand she takes it, and with the other she holds out to\r\nyou twenty roubles by way of subscription to one of the benevolent\r\ncommittees in Petersburg and Moscow, of which you are a member... for\r\nyou published yourself, madam, in the _Moscow News,_ that you are ready to\r\nreceive subscriptions in our town, and that any one may subscribe.","...\"\r\n\r\nThe captain suddenly broke off; he breathed hard as though after some\r\ndifficult achievement. All he said about the benevolent society had\r\nprobably been prepared beforehand, perhaps under Liputin's supervision.\r\nHe perspired more than ever; drops literally trickled down his temples.\r\nVarvara Petrovna looked searchingly at him.\r\n\r\n\"The subscription list,\" she said severely, \"is always downstairs in\r\ncharge of my porter.","There you can enter your subscriptions if you wish\r\nto. And so I beg you to put your notes away and not to wave them in the\r\nair. That's right. I beg you also to go back to your seat. That's right.\r\nI am very sorry, sir, that I made a mistake about your sister, and gave\r\nher something as though she were poor when she is so rich. There's only\r\none thing I don't understand, why she can only take from me, and no one\r\nelse.","You so insisted upon that that I should like a full explanation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam, that is a secret that may be buried only in the grave!\" answered\r\nthe captain.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" Varvara Petrovna asked, not quite so firmly.\r\n\r\n\"Madam, madam...\"\r\n\r\nHe relapsed into gloomy silence, looking on the floor, laying his right\r\nhand on his heart. Varvara Petrovna waited, not taking her eyes off him.\r\n\r\n\"Madam!\" he roared suddenly.","\"Will you allow me to ask you one question?\r\nOnly one, but frankly, directly, like a Russian, from the heart?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kindly do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever suffered madam, in your life?\"\r\n\r\n\"You simply mean to say that you have been or are being ill-treated by\r\nsomeone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam, madam!\" He jumped up again, probably unconscious of doing\r\nso, and struck himself on the breast. \"Here in this bosom so much has\r\naccumulated, so much that God Himself will be amazed when it is revealed\r\nat the Day of Judgment.","\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm! A strong expression!\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam, I speak perhaps irritably....\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be uneasy. I know myself when to stop you.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I ask you another question, madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask another question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can one die simply from the generosity of one's feelings?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, as I've never asked myself such a question.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know! You've never asked yourself such a question,\" he said\r\nwith pathetic irony.","\"Well, if that's it, if that's it...\r\n\r\n_\"Be still, despairing heart!\"_\r\n\r\nAnd he struck himself furiously on the chest. He was by now walking\r\nabout the room again.\r\n\r\nIt is typical of such people to be utterly incapable of keeping their\r\ndesires to themselves; they have, on the contrary, an irresistible\r\nimpulse to display them in all their unseemliness as soon as they arise.\r\nWhen such a gentleman gets into a circle in which he is not at home\r\nhe usually begins timidly,--but you have only to give him an inch and he\r\nwill at once rush into impertinence.","The captain was already excited.\r\nHe walked about waving his arms and not listening to questions, talked\r\nabout himself very, very quickly, so that sometimes his tongue would not\r\nobey him, and without finishing one phrase he passed to another. It is\r\ntrue he was probably not quite sober. Moreover, Lizaveta Nikolaevna\r\nwas sitting there too, and though he did not once glance at her, her\r\npresence seemed to over-excite him terribly; that, however, is only my\r\nsupposition.","There must have been some reason which led Varvara Petrovna\r\nto resolve to listen to such a man in spite of her repugnance. Praskovya\r\nIvanovna was simply shaking with terror, though, I believe she really\r\ndid not quite understand what it was about. Stepan Trofimovitch was\r\ntrembling too, but that was, on the contrary, because he was disposed to\r\nunderstand everything, and exaggerate it. Mavriky Nikolaevitch stood in\r\nthe attitude of one ready to defend all present; Liza was pale, and she\r\ngazed fixedly with wide-open eyes at the wild captain.","Shatov sat in\r\nthe same position as before, but, what was strangest of all, Marya\r\nTimofyevna had not only ceased laughing, but had become terribly sad.\r\nShe leaned her right elbow on the table, and with a prolonged, mournful\r\ngaze watched her brother declaiming. Darya Pavlovna alone seemed to me\r\ncalm.\r\n\r\n\"All that is nonsensical allegory,\" said Varvara Petrovna, getting angry\r\nat last. \"You haven't answered my question, why? I insist on an answer.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't answered, why? You insist on an answer, why?\" repeated\r\nthe captain, winking. \"That little word 'why' has run through all the\r\nuniverse from the first day of creation, and all nature cries every\r\nminute to it's Creator, 'why?' And for seven thousand years it has had\r\nno answer, and must Captain Lebyadkin alone answer? And is that justice,\r\nmadam?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all nonsense and not to the point!\" cried Varvara Petrovna,\r\ngetting angry and losing patience.","\"That's allegory; besides, you\r\nexpress yourself too sensationally, sir, which I consider impertinence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" the captain went on, not hearing, \"I should have liked perhaps\r\nto be called Ernest, yet I am forced to bear the vulgar name Ignat--why\r\nis that do you suppose? I should have liked to be called Prince de\r\nMonbart, yet I am only Lebyadkin, derived from a swan.* Why is that?\r\nI am a poet, madam, a poet in soul, and might be getting a thousand\r\nroubles at a time from a publisher, yet I am forced to live in a pig\r\npail.","Why? Why, madam? To my mind Russia is a freak of nature and\r\nnothing else.\"\r\n\r\n    * From Lebyed, a Swan.\r\n\r\n\"Can you really say nothing more definite?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can read you the poem, 'The Cockroach,' madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wha-a-t?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam, I'm not mad yet! I shall be mad, no doubt I shall be, but I'm\r\nnot so yet. Madam, a friend of mine--a most honourable man--has written\r\na Krylov's fable, called 'The Cockroach.","' May I read it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You want to read some fable of Krylov's?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it's not a fable of Krylov's I want to read. It's my fable, my own\r\ncomposition. Believe me, madam, without offence I'm not so uneducated\r\nand depraved as not to understand that Russia can boast of a great\r\nfable-writer, Krylov, to whom the Minister of Education has raised a\r\nmonument in the Summer Gardens for the diversion of the young.","Here,\r\nmadam, you ask me why? The answer is at the end of this fable, in\r\nletters of fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Read your fable.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Lived a cockroach in the world\r\n     Such was his condition,\r\n     In a glass he chanced to fall\r\n     Full of fly-perdition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heavens! What does it mean?\" cried Varvara Petrovna.\r\n\r\n\"That's when flies get into a glass in the summer-time,\" the captain\r\nexplained hurriedly with the irritable impatience of an author interrupted\r\nin reading.","\"Then it is perdition to the flies, any fool can understand.\r\nDon't interrupt, don't interrupt. You'll see, you'll see....\" He kept waving\r\nhis arms.\r\n\r\n     \"But he squeezed against the flies,\r\n     They woke up and cursed him,\r\n     Raised to Jove their angry cries;\r\n     'The glass is full to bursting!'\r\n     In the middle of the din\r\n     Came along Nikifor,\r\n     Fine old man, and looking in.","..\r\n\r\nI haven't quite finished it. But no matter, I'll tell it in words,\"\r\nthe captain rattled on. \"Nikifor takes the glass, and in spite of their\r\noutcry empties away the whole stew, flies, and beetles and all, into the\r\npig pail, which ought to have been done long ago. But observe, madam,\r\nobserve, the cockroach doesn't complain. That's the answer to your\r\nquestion, why?\" he cried triumphantly. \"'The cockroach does not\r\ncomplain.","' As for Nikifor he typifies nature,\" he added, speaking\r\nrapidly and walking complacently about the room.\r\n\r\nVarvara Petrovna was terribly angry.\r\n\r\n\"And allow me to ask you about that money said to have been received\r\nfrom Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, and not to have been given to you, about\r\nwhich you dared to accuse a person belonging to my household.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a slander!\" roared Lebyadkin, flinging up his right hand\r\ntragically.","\"No, it's not a slander.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam, there are circumstances that force one to endure family disgrace\r\nrather than proclaim the truth aloud. Lebyadkin will not blab, madam!\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed dazed; he was carried away; he felt his importance; he\r\ncertainly had some fancy in his mind. By now he wanted to insult some\r\none, to do something nasty to show his power.\r\n\r\n\"Ring, please, Stepan Trofimovitch,\" Varvara Petrovna asked him.","\"Lebyadkin's cunning, madam,\" he said, winking with his evil smile;\r\n\"he's cunning, but he too has a weak spot, he too at times is in the\r\nportals of passions, and these portals are the old military hussars'\r\nbottle, celebrated by Denis Davydov. So when he is in those portals,\r\nmadam, he may happen to send a letter in verse, a most magnificent\r\nletter--but which afterwards he would have wished to take back, with the\r\ntears of all his life; for the feeling of the beautiful is destroyed.","But the bird has flown, you won't catch it by the tail. In those portals\r\nnow, madam, Lebyadkin may have spoken about an honourable young lady,\r\nin the honourable indignation of a soul revolted by wrongs, and his\r\nslanderers have taken advantage of it. But Lebyadkin is cunning, madam!\r\nAnd in vain a malignant wolf sits over him every minute, filling his\r\nglass and waiting for the end. Lebyadkin won't blab.","And at the bottom\r\nof the bottle he always finds instead Lebyadkin's cunning. But enough,\r\noh, enough, madam! Your splendid halls might belong to the noblest in\r\nthe land, but the cockroach will not complain. Observe that, observe\r\nthat he does not complain, and recognise his noble spirit!\"\r\n\r\nAt that instant a bell rang downstairs from the porter's room, and\r\nalmost at the same moment Alexey Yegorytch appeared in response to\r\nStepan Trofimovitch's ring, which he had somewhat delayed answering.","The\r\ncorrect old servant was unusually excited.\r\n\r\n\"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch has graciously arrived this moment and is\r\ncoming here,\" he pronounced, in reply to Varvara Petrovna's questioning\r\nglance. I particularly remember her at that moment; at first she turned\r\npale, but suddenly her eyes flashed. She drew herself up in her chair\r\nwith an air of extraordinary determination. Every one was astounded\r\nindeed.","The utterly unexpected arrival of Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch,\r\nwho was not expected for another month, was not only strange from its\r\nunexpectedness but from its fateful coincidence with the present moment.\r\nEven the captain remained standing like a post in the middle of the room\r\nwith his mouth wide open, staring at the door with a fearfully stupid\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nAnd, behold, from the next room--a very large and long apartment--came\r\nthe sound of swiftly approaching footsteps, little, exceedingly rapid\r\nsteps; someone seemed to be running, and that someone suddenly flew\r\ninto the drawing-room, not Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, but a young man who\r\nwas a complete stranger to all.","V\r\n\r\nI will permit myself to halt here to sketch in a few hurried strokes\r\nthis person who had so suddenly arrived on the scene.\r\n\r\nHe was a young man of twenty-seven or thereabouts, a little above the\r\nmedium height, with rather long, lank, flaxen hair, and with faintly\r\ndefined, irregular moustache and beard. He was dressed neatly, and in\r\nthe fashion, though not like a dandy. At the first glance he looked\r\nround-shouldered and awkward, but yet he was not round-shouldered, and\r\nhis manner was easy.","He seemed a queer fish, and yet later on we all\r\nthought his manners good, and his conversation always to the point.\r\n\r\nNo one would have said that he was ugly, and yet no one would have liked\r\nhis face. His head was elongated at the back, and looked flattened at\r\nthe sides, so that his face seemed pointed, his forehead was high and\r\nnarrow, but his features were small; his eyes were keen, his nose was\r\nsmall and sharp, his lips were long and thin.","The expression of his face\r\nsuggested ill-health, but this was misleading. He had a wrinkle on each\r\ncheek which gave him the look of a man who had just recovered from a\r\nserious illness. Yet he was perfectly well and strong, and had never\r\nbeen ill.\r\n\r\nHe walked and moved very hurriedly, yet never seemed in a hurry to\r\nbe off. It seemed as though nothing could disconcert him; in every\r\ncircumstance and in every sort of society he remained the same.","He had a\r\ngreat deal of conceit, but was utterly unaware of it himself.\r\n\r\nHe talked quickly, hurriedly, but at the same time with assurance, and\r\nwas never at a loss for a word. In spite of his hurried manner his ideas\r\nwere in perfect order, distinct and definite--and this was particularly\r\nstriking. His articulation was wonderfully clear. His words pattered out\r\nlike smooth, big grains, always well chosen, and at your service.","At first this attracted one, but afterwards it became repulsive, just\r\nbecause of this over-distinct articulation, this string of ever-ready\r\nwords.  One somehow began to imagine that he must have a tongue of\r\nspecial shape, somehow exceptionally long and thin, extremely red with a\r\nvery sharp everlastingly active little tip.\r\n\r\nWell, this was the young man who darted now into the drawing-room, and\r\nreally, I believe to this day, that he began to talk in the next room,\r\nand came in speaking.","He was standing before Varvara Petrovna in a\r\ntrice.\r\n\r\n\"... Only fancy, Varvara Petrovna,\" he pattered on, \"I came in expecting\r\nto find he'd been here for the last quarter of an hour; he arrived an\r\nhour and a half ago; we met at Kirillov's: he set off half an hour ago\r\nmeaning to come straight here, and told me to come here too, a quarter\r\nof an hour later....\"\r\n\r\n\"But who? Who told you to come here?\" Varvara Petrovna inquired.","\"Why, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch! Surely this isn't the first you've heard\r\nof it! But his luggage must have been here a long while, anyway. How\r\nis it you weren't told? Then I'm the first to bring the news. One might\r\nsend out to look for him; he's sure to be here himself directly\r\nthough. And I fancy, at the moment that just fits in with some of\r\nhis expectations, and is far as I can judge, at least, some of his\r\ncalculations.","\"\r\n\r\nAt this point he turned his eyes about the room and fixed them with\r\nspecial attention on the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Ach, Lizaveta Nikolaevna, how glad I am to meet you at the very first\r\nstep, delighted to shake hands with you.\" He flew up to Liza, who\r\nwas smiling gaily, to take her proffered hand, \"and I observe that my\r\nhonoured friend Praskovya Ivanovna has not forgotten her 'professor,'\r\nand actually isn't cross with him, as she always used to be in\r\nSwitzerland.","But how are your legs, here, Praskovya Ivanovna, and were\r\nthe Swiss doctors right when at the consultation they prescribed your\r\nnative air? What? Fomentations? That ought to do good. But how sorry I\r\nwas, Varvara Petrovna\" (he turned rapidly to her) \"that I didn't arrive\r\nin time to meet you abroad, and offer my respects to you in person; I\r\nhad so much to tell you too. I did send word to my old man here, but I\r\nfancy that he did as he always does.","..\"\r\n\r\n\"Petrusha!\" cried Stepan Trofimovitch, instantly roused from his\r\nstupefaction. He clasped his hands and flew to his son. \"_Pierre, mon\r\nenfant!_ Why, I didn't know you!\" He pressed him in his arms and the\r\ntears rolled down his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Come, be quiet, be quiet, no flourishes, that's enough, that's enough,\r\nplease,\" Petrusha muttered hurriedly, trying to extricate himself from\r\nhis embrace.","\"I've always sinned against you, always!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's enough. We can talk of that later. I knew you'd carry on.\r\nCome, be a little more sober, please.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's ten years since I've seen you.\"\r\n\r\n\"The less reason for demonstrations.\"\r\n\r\n_\"Mon enfant!...\"_\r\n\r\n\"Come, I believe in your affection, I believe in it, take your arms\r\naway. You see, you're disturbing other people.... Ah, here's Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch; keep quiet, please.","\"\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch was already in the room; he came in very quietly\r\nand stood still for an instant in the doorway, quietly scrutinising the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nI was struck by the first sight of him just as I had been four years\r\nbefore, when I saw him for the first time. I had not forgotten him in\r\nthe least. But I think there are some countenances which always seem to\r\nexhibit something new which one has not noticed before, every time\r\none meets them, though one may have seen them a hundred times already.","Apparently he was exactly the same as he had been four years before. He\r\nwas as elegant, as dignified, he moved with the same air of consequence\r\nas before, indeed he looked almost as young. His faint smile had just\r\nthe same official graciousness and complacency. His eyes had the same\r\nstern, thoughtful and, as it were, preoccupied look. In fact, it seemed\r\nas though we had only parted the day before.","But one thing struck me. In\r\nold days, though he had been considered handsome, his face was \"like a\r\nmask,\" as some of our sharp-tongued ladies had expressed it. Now--now,\r\nI don't know why he impressed me at once as absolutely, incontestably\r\nbeautiful, so that no one could have said that his face was like a mask.\r\nWasn't it perhaps that he was a little paler and seemed rather thinner\r\nthan before? Or was there, perhaps, the light of some new idea in his\r\neyes?\r\n\r\n\"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch!\" cried Varvara Petrovna, drawing herself up\r\nbut not rising from her chair.","\"Stop a minute!\" She checked his advance\r\nwith a peremptory gesture.\r\n\r\nBut to explain the awful question which immediately followed that\r\ngesture and exclamation--a question which I should have imagined to be\r\nimpossible even in Varvara Petrovna, I must ask the reader to remember\r\nwhat that lady's temperament had always been, and the extraordinary\r\nimpulsiveness she showed at some critical moments.","I beg him to consider\r\nalso, that in spite of the exceptional strength of her spirit and\r\nthe very considerable amount of common sense and practical, so to say\r\nbusiness, tact she possessed, there were moments in her life in which\r\nshe abandoned herself altogether, entirely and, if it's permissible\r\nto say so, absolutely without restraint. I beg him to take into\r\nconsideration also that the present moment might really be for her one\r\nof those in which all the essence of life, of all the past and all the\r\npresent, perhaps, too, all the future, is concentrated, as it were,\r\nfocused.","I must briefly recall, too, the anonymous letter of which she\r\nhad spoken to Praskovya Ivanovna with so much irritation, though I think\r\nshe said nothing of the latter part of it. Yet it perhaps contained the\r\nexplanation of the possibility of the terrible question with which she\r\nsuddenly addressed her son.\r\n\r\n\"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch,\" she repeated, rapping out her words in a\r\nresolute voice in which there was a ring of menacing challenge, \"I beg\r\nyou to tell me at once, without moving from that place; is it true that\r\nthis unhappy cripple--here she is, here, look at her--is it true that\r\nshe is.",".. your lawful wife?\"\r\n\r\nI remember that moment only too well; he did not wink an eyelash but\r\nlooked intently at his mother. Not the faintest change in his face\r\nfollowed. At last he smiled, a sort of indulgent smile, and without\r\nanswering a word went quietly up to his mother, took her hand, raised it\r\nrespectfully to his lips and kissed it. And so great was his invariable\r\nand irresistible ascendancy over his mother that even now she could not\r\nbring herself to pull away her hand.","She only gazed at him, her whole\r\nfigure one concentrated question, seeming to betray that she could not\r\nbear the suspense another moment.\r\n\r\nBut he was still silent. When he had kissed her hand, he scanned the\r\nwhole room once more, and moving, as before, without haste went towards\r\nMarya Timofyevna. It is very difficult to describe people's countenances\r\nat certain moments. I remember, for instance, that Marya Timofyevna,\r\nbreathless with fear, rose to her feet to meet him and clasped her hands\r\nbefore her, as though beseeching him.","And at the same time I remember\r\nthe frantic ecstasy which almost distorted her face--an ecstasy almost\r\ntoo great for any human being to bear. Perhaps both were there, both the\r\nterror and the ecstasy. But I remember moving quickly towards her (I was\r\nstanding not far off), for I fancied she was going to faint.\r\n\r\n\"You should not be here,\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch said to her in\r\na caressing and melodious voice; and there was the light of an\r\nextraordinary tenderness in his eyes.","He stood before her in the most\r\nrespectful attitude, and every gesture showed sincere respect for her.\r\nThe poor girl faltered impulsively in a half-whisper.\r\n\r\n\"But may I... kneel down... to you now?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you can't do that.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled at her magnificently, so that she too laughed joyfully at\r\nonce. In the same melodious voice, coaxing her tenderly as though she\r\nwere a child, he went on gravely.","\"Only think that you are a girl, and that though I'm your devoted friend\r\nI'm an outsider, not your husband, nor your father, nor your betrothed.\r\nGive me your arm and let us go; I will take you to the carriage, and if\r\nyou will let me I will see you all the way home.\"\r\n\r\nShe listened, and bent her head as though meditating.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go,\" she said with a sigh, giving him her hand.\r\n\r\nBut at that point a slight mischance befell her.","She must have turned\r\ncarelessly, resting on her lame leg, which was shorter than the other.\r\nShe fell sideways into the chair, and if the chair had not been there\r\nwould have fallen on to the floor. He instantly seized and supported\r\nher, and holding her arm firmly in his, led her carefully and\r\nsympathetically to the door. She was evidently mortified at having\r\nfallen; she was overwhelmed, blushed, and was terribly abashed.","Looking\r\ndumbly on the ground, limping painfully, she hobbled after him, almost\r\nhanging on his arm. So they went out. Liza, I saw, suddenly jumped up\r\nfrom her chair for some reason as they were going out, and she followed\r\nthem with intent eyes till they reached the door. Then she sat down\r\nagain in silence, but there was a nervous twitching in her face, as\r\nthough she had touched a viper.\r\n\r\nWhile this scene was taking place between Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch and\r\nMarya Timofyevna every one was speechless with amazement; one could have\r\nheard a fly; but as soon as they had gone out, every one began suddenly\r\ntalking.","VI\r\n\r\nIt was very little of it talk, however; it was mostly exclamation. I've\r\nforgotten a little the order in which things happened, for a scene of\r\nconfusion followed. Stepan Trofimovitch uttered some exclamation in\r\nFrench, clasping his hands, but Varvara Petrovna had no thought for him.\r\nEven Mavriky Nikolaevitch muttered some rapid, jerky comment. But Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch was the most excited of all.","He was trying desperately with\r\nbold gesticulations to persuade Varvara Petrovna of something, but it\r\nwas a long time before I could make out what it was. He appealed\r\nto Praskovya Ivanovna, and Lizaveta Nikolaevna too, even, in his\r\nexcitement, addressed a passing shout to his father--in fact he seemed\r\nall over the room at once. Varvara Petrovna, flushing all over, sprang\r\nup from her seat and cried to Praskovya Ivanovna:\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear what he said to her here just now, did you hear it?\"\r\n\r\nBut the latter was incapable of replying.","She could only mutter\r\nsomething and wave her hand. The poor woman had troubles of her own to\r\nthink about. She kept turning her head towards Liza and was watching her\r\nwith unaccountable terror, but she didn't even dare to think of getting\r\nup and going away until her daughter should get up. In the meantime the\r\ncaptain wanted to slip away. That I noticed. There was no doubt that he\r\nhad been in a great panic from the instant that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch\r\nhad made his appearance; but Pyotr Stepanovitch took him by the arm and\r\nwould not let him go.","\"It is necessary, quite necessary,\" he pattered on to Varvara Petrovna,\r\nstill trying to persuade her. He stood facing her, as she was sitting\r\ndown again in her easy chair, and, I remember, was listening to him\r\neagerly; he had succeeded in securing her attention.\r\n\r\n\"It is necessary. You can see for yourself, Varvara Petrovna, that there\r\nis a misunderstanding here, and much that is strange on the surface,\r\nand yet the thing's as clear as daylight, and as simple as my finger.","I\r\nquite understand that no one has authorised me to tell the story, and\r\nI dare say I look ridiculous putting myself forward. But in the first\r\nplace, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch attaches no sort of significance to\r\nthe matter himself, and, besides, there are incidents of which it is\r\ndifficult for a man to make up his mind to give an explanation himself.\r\nAnd so it's absolutely necessary that it should be undertaken by a third\r\nperson, for whom it's easier to put some delicate points into words.","Believe me, Varvara Petrovna, that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch is not at\r\nall to blame for not immediately answering your question just now with\r\na full explanation, it's all a trivial affair. I've known him since his\r\nPetersburg days. Besides, the whole story only does honour to Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch, if one must make use of that vague word 'honour.'\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean to say that you were a witness of some incident which gave\r\nrise.",".. to this misunderstanding?\" asked Varvara Petrovna.\r\n\r\n\"I witnessed it, and took part in it,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch hastened to\r\ndeclare.\r\n\r\n\"If you'll give me your word that this will not wound Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch's delicacy in regard to his feeling for me, from whom\r\nhe ne-e-ver conceals anything... and if you are convinced also that your\r\ndoing this will be agreeable to him...\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly it will be agreeable, and for that reason I consider it a\r\nparticularly agreeable duty.","I am convinced that he would beg me to do\r\nit himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe intrusive desire of this gentleman, who seemed to have dropped on\r\nus from heaven to tell stories about other people's affairs, was rather\r\nstrange and inconsistent with ordinary usage.\r\n\r\nBut he had caught Varvara Petrovna by touching on too painful a spot.\r\nI did not know the man's character at that time, and still less his\r\ndesigns.","\"I am listening,\" Varvara Petrovna announced with a reserved and\r\ncautious manner. She was rather painfully aware of her condescension.\r\n\r\n\"It's a short story; in fact if you like it's not a story at all,\" he\r\nrattled on, \"though a novelist might work it up into a novel in an idle\r\nhour. It's rather an interesting little incident, Praskovya Ivanovna,\r\nand I am sure that Lizaveta Nikolaevna will be interested to hear\r\nit, because there are a great many things in it that are odd if not\r\nwonderful.","Five years ago, in Petersburg, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch\r\nmade the acquaintance of this gentleman, this very Mr. Lebyadkin who's\r\nstanding here with his mouth open, anxious, I think, to slip away at\r\nonce. Excuse me, Varvara Petrovna. I don't advise you to make your\r\nescape though, you discharged clerk in the former commissariat\r\ndepartment; you see, I remember you very well. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch\r\nand I know very well what you've been up to here, and, don't forget,\r\nyou'll have to answer for it.","I ask your pardon once more, Varvara\r\nPetrovna. In those days Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch used to call this\r\ngentleman his Falstaff; that must be,\" he explained suddenly, \"some old\r\nburlesque character, at whom every one laughs, and who is willing to\r\nlet every one laugh at him, if only they'll pay him for it. Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch was leading at that time in Petersburg a life, so to\r\nsay, of mockery.","I can't find another word to describe it, because he\r\nis not a man who falls into disillusionment, and he disdained to be\r\noccupied with work at that time. I'm only speaking of that period,\r\nVarvara Petrovna. Lebyadkin had a sister, the woman who was sitting here\r\njust now. The brother and sister hadn't a corner* of their own, but\r\nwere always quartering themselves on different people. He used to hang\r\nabout the arcades in the Gostiny Dvor, always wearing his old uniform,\r\nand would stop the more respectable-looking passers-by, and everything\r\nhe got from them he'd spend in drink.","His sister lived like the birds\r\nof heaven. She'd help people in their 'corners,' and do jobs for them\r\non occasion. It was a regular Bedlam. I'll pass over the description\r\nof this life in 'corners,' a life to which Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had\r\ntaken,\"\r\n\r\n     * In the poorer quarters of Russian towns a single room is often\r\n     let out to several families, each of which occupies a \"corner.\"\r\n\r\n\"at that time, from eccentricity.","I'm only talking of that period,\r\nVarvara Petrovna; as for 'eccentricity,' that's his own expression. He\r\ndoes not conceal much from me. Mlle. Lebyadkin, who was thrown in the\r\nway of meeting Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch very often, at one time, was\r\nfascinated by his appearance. He was, so to say, a diamond set in the\r\ndirty background of her life. I am a poor hand at describing feelings,\r\nso I'll pass them over; but some of that dirty lot took to jeering at\r\nher once, and it made her sad.","They always had laughed at her, but she\r\ndid not seem to notice it before. She wasn't quite right in her head\r\neven then, but very different from what she is now. There's reason to\r\nbelieve that in her childhood she received something like an education\r\nthrough the kindness of a benevolent lady. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch\r\nhad never taken the slightest notice of her. He used to spend his time\r\nchiefly in playing preference with a greasy old pack of cards for\r\nstakes of a quarter-farthing with clerks.","But once, when she was being\r\nill-treated, he went up (without inquiring into the cause) and seized\r\none of the clerks by the collar and flung him out of a second-floor\r\nwindow. It was not a case of chivalrous indignation at the sight of\r\ninjured innocence; the whole operation took place in the midst of roars\r\nof laughter, and the one who laughed loudest was Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch\r\nhimself. As it all ended without harm, they were reconciled and began\r\ndrinking punch.","But the injured innocent herself did not forget it. Of\r\ncourse it ended in her becoming completely crazy. I repeat I'm a poor\r\nhand at describing feelings. But a delusion was the chief feature in\r\nthis case. And Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch aggravated that delusion as\r\nthough he did it on purpose. Instead of laughing at her he began all\r\nat once treating Mlle. Lebyadkin with sudden respect. Kirillov, who was\r\nthere (a very original man, Varvara Petrovna, and very abrupt, you'll\r\nsee him perhaps one day, for he's here now), well, this Kirillov who,\r\nas a rule, is perfectly silent, suddenly got hot, and said to Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch, I remember, that he treated the girl as though she were\r\na marquise, and that that was doing for her altogether.","I must add that\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch had rather a respect for this Kirillov. What do\r\nyou suppose was the answer he gave him: 'You imagine, Mr. Kirillov, that\r\nI am laughing at her. Get rid of that idea, I really do respect her,\r\nfor she's better than any of us.' And, do you know, he said it in such a\r\nserious tone. Meanwhile, he hadn't really said a word to her for two or\r\nthree months, except 'good morning' and 'good-bye.","' I remember, for I\r\nwas there, that she came at last to the point of looking on him almost\r\nas her betrothed who dared not 'elope with her,' simply because he had\r\nmany enemies and family difficulties, or something of the sort.\r\nThere was a great deal of laughter about it. It ended in Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch's making provision for her when he had to come here, and\r\nI believe he arranged to pay a considerable sum, three hundred roubles a\r\nyear, if not more, as a pension for her.","In short it was all a caprice,\r\na fancy of a man prematurely weary on his side, perhaps--it may even\r\nhave been, as Kirillov says, a new experiment of a blas√© man, with\r\nthe object of finding out what you can bring a crazy cripple to.\" (You\r\npicked out on purpose, he said, the lowest creature, a cripple, forever\r\ncovered with disgrace and blows, knowing, too, that this creature was\r\ndying of comic love for you, and set to work to mystify her completely\r\non purpose, simply to see what would come of it.",") \"Though, how is a man\r\nso particularly to blame for the fancies of a crazy woman, to whom\r\nhe had hardly uttered two sentences the whole time. There are things,\r\nVarvara Petrovna, of which it is not only impossible to speak sensibly,\r\nbut it's even nonsensical to begin speaking of them at all. Well,\r\neccentricity then, let it stand at that. Anyway, there's nothing worse\r\nto be said than that; and yet now they've made this scandal out of it.","... I am to some extent aware, Varvara Petrovna, of what is happening\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nThe speaker suddenly broke off and was turning to Lebyadkin. But Varvara\r\nPetrovna checked him. She was in a state of extreme exaltation.\r\n\r\n\"Have you finished?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet; to complete my story I should have to ask this gentleman one\r\nor two questions if you'll allow me... you'll see the point in a minute,\r\nVarvara Petrovna.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, afterwards, leave it for the moment I beg you. Oh, I was quite\r\nright to let you speak!\"\r\n\r\n\"And note this, Varvara Petrovna,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch said hastily.\r\n\"Could Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch have explained all this just now in\r\nanswer to your question, which was perhaps too peremptory?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"And wasn't I right in saying that in some cases it's much easier for a\r\nthird person to explain things than for the person interested?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes.",".. but in one thing you were mistaken, and, I see with regret,\r\nare still mistaken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, what's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"You see.... But won't you sit down, Pyotr Stepanovitch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, as you please. I am tired indeed. Thank you.\" He instantly moved up\r\nan easy chair and turned it so that he had Varvara Petrovna on one\r\nside and Praskovya Ivanovna at the table on the other, while he faced\r\nLebyadkin, from whom he did not take his eyes for one minute.","\"You are mistaken in calling this eccentricity....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if it's only that....\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no, wait a little,\" said Varvara Petrovna, who was obviously\r\nabout to say a good deal and to speak with enthusiasm. As soon as Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch noticed it, he was all attention.\r\n\r\n\"No, it was something higher than eccentricity, and I assure you,\r\nsomething sacred even! A proud man who has suffered humiliation early\r\nin life and reached the stage of 'mockery' as you so subtly called\r\nit--Prince Harry, in fact, to use the capital nickname Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch gave him then, which would have been perfectly correct if\r\nit were not that he is more like Hamlet, to my thinking at least.","\"\r\n\r\n_\"Et vous avez raison,\"_ Stepan Trofimovitch pronounced, impressively and\r\nwith feeling.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Stepan Trofimovitch. I thank you particularly too for your\r\nunvarying faith in Nicolas, in the loftiness of his soul and of his\r\ndestiny. That faith you have even strengthened in me when I was losing\r\nheart.\"\r\n\r\n_\"Ch√®re, ch√®re.\"_ Stepan Trofimovitch was stepping forward, when he\r\nchecked himself, reflecting that it was dangerous to interrupt.","\"And if Nicolas had always had at his side\" (Varvara Petrovna almost\r\nshouted) \"a gentle Horatio, great in his humility--another excellent\r\nexpression of yours, Stepan Trofimovitch--he might long ago have been\r\nsaved from the sad and 'sudden demon of irony,' which has tormented him\r\nall his life. ('The demon of irony' was a wonderful expression of yours\r\nagain, Stepan Trofimovitch.) But Nicolas has never had an Horatio or an\r\nOphelia.","He had no one but his mother, and what can a mother do alone,\r\nand in such circumstances? Do you know, Pyotr Stepanovitch, it's\r\nperfectly comprehensible to me now that a being like Nicolas could be\r\nfound even in such filthy haunts as you have described. I can so clearly\r\npicture now that 'mockery' of life. (A wonderfully subtle expression\r\nof yours!) That insatiable thirst of contrast, that gloomy background\r\nagainst which he stands out like a diamond, to use your comparison\r\nagain, Pyotr Stepanovitch.","And then he meets there a creature\r\nill-treated by every one, crippled, half insane, and at the same time\r\nperhaps filled with noble feelings.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm.... Yes, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"And after that you don't understand that he's not laughing at her like\r\nevery one. Oh, you people! You can't understand his defending her from\r\ninsult, treating her with respect 'like a marquise' (this Kirillov\r\nmust have an exceptionally deep understanding of men, though he didn't\r\nunderstand Nicolas).","It was just this contrast, if you like, that led to\r\nthe trouble. If the unhappy creature had been in different surroundings,\r\nperhaps she would never have been brought to entertain such a frantic\r\ndelusion. Only a woman can understand it, Pyotr Stepanovitch, only a\r\nwoman. How sorry I am that you... not that you're not a woman, but that\r\nyou can't be one just for the moment so as to understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean in the sense that the worse things are the better it is.","I\r\nunderstand, I understand, Varvara Petrovna. It's rather as it is in\r\nreligion; the harder life is for a man or the more crushed and poor the\r\npeople are, the more obstinately they dream of compensation in heaven;\r\nand if a hundred thousand priests are at work at it too, inflaming\r\ntheir delusion, and speculating on it, then... I understand you, Varvara\r\nPetrovna, I assure you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not quite it; but tell me, ought Nicolas to have laughed at her\r\nand have treated her as the other clerks, in order to extinguish the\r\ndelusion in this unhappy organism.","\" (Why Varvara Petrovna used the word\r\norganism I couldn't understand.) \"Can you really refuse to recognise\r\nthe lofty compassion, the noble tremor of the whole organism with which\r\nNicolas answered Kirillov: 'I do not laugh at her.' A noble, sacred\r\nanswer!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sublime,\" muttered Stepan Trofimovitch.\r\n\r\n\"And observe, too, that he is by no means so rich as you suppose. The\r\nmoney is mine and not his, and he would take next to nothing from me\r\nthen.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand, I understand all that, Varvara Petrovna,\" said Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch, with a movement of some impatience.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's my character! I recognise myself in Nicolas. I recognise that\r\nyouthfulness, that liability to violent, tempestuous impulses. And if\r\nwe ever come to be friends, Pyotr Stepanovitch, and, for my part, I\r\nsincerely hope we may, especially as I am so deeply indebted to you,\r\nthen, perhaps you'll understand.","...\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I assure you, I hope for it too,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch muttered\r\njerkily.\r\n\r\n\"You'll understand then the impulse which leads one in the blindness\r\nof generous feeling to take up a man who is unworthy of one in every\r\nrespect, a man who utterly fails to understand one, who is ready to\r\ntorture one at every opportunity and, in contradiction to everything, to\r\nexalt such a man into a sort of ideal, into a dream.","To concentrate in\r\nhim all one's hopes, to bow down before him; to love him all one's life,\r\nabsolutely without knowing why--perhaps just because he was unworthy of\r\nit.... Oh, how I've suffered all my life, Pyotr Stepanovitch!\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch, with a look of suffering on his face, began trying\r\nto catch my eye, but I turned away in time.\r\n\r\n\"... And only lately, only lately--oh, how unjust I've been to Nicolas!\r\n.",".. You would not believe how they have been worrying me on all sides,\r\nall, all, enemies, and rascals, and friends, friends perhaps more than\r\nenemies. When the first contemptible anonymous letter was sent to me,\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch, you'll hardly believe it, but I had not strength\r\nenough to treat all this wickedness with contempt.... I shall never,\r\nnever forgive myself for my weakness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had heard something of anonymous letters here already,\" said Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch, growing suddenly more lively, \"and I'll find out the\r\nwriters of them, you may be sure.","\"\r\n\r\n\"But you can't imagine the intrigues that have been got up here. They\r\nhave even been pestering our poor Praskovya Ivanovna, and what reason\r\ncan they have for worrying her? I was quite unfair to you to-day\r\nperhaps, my dear Praskovya Ivanovna,\" she added in a generous impulse of\r\nkindliness, though not without a certain triumphant irony.\r\n\r\n\"Don't say any more, my dear,\" the other lady muttered reluctantly.","\"To my thinking we'd better make an end of all this; too much has been\r\nsaid.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again she looked timidly towards Liza, but the latter was looking at\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch.\r\n\r\n\"And I intend now to adopt this poor unhappy creature, this insane\r\nwoman who has lost everything and kept only her heart,\" Varvara Petrovna\r\nexclaimed suddenly. \"It's a sacred duty I intend to carry out. I take\r\nher under my protection from this day.","\"\r\n\r\n\"And that will be a very good thing in one way,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\ncried, growing quite eager again. \"Excuse me, I did not finish just now.\r\nIt's just the care of her I want to speak of. Would you believe it, that\r\nas soon as Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had gone (I'm beginning from where\r\nI left off, Varvara Petrovna), this gentleman here, this Mr. Lebyadkin,\r\ninstantly imagined he had the right to dispose of the whole pension\r\nthat was provided for his sister.","And he did dispose of it. I don't\r\nknow exactly how it had been arranged by Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch at that\r\ntime. But a year later, when he learned from abroad what had happened,\r\nhe was obliged to make other arrangements. Again, I don't know the\r\ndetails; he'll tell you them himself. I only know that the interesting\r\nyoung person was placed somewhere in a remote nunnery, in very\r\ncomfortable surroundings, but under friendly superintendence--you\r\nunderstand? But what do you think Mr.","Lebyadkin made up his mind to do?\r\nHe exerted himself to the utmost, to begin with, to find where\r\nhis source of income, that is his sister, was hidden. Only lately he\r\nattained his object, took her from the nunnery, asserting some claim to\r\nher, and brought her straight here. Here he doesn't feed her properly,\r\nbeats her, and bullies her. As soon as by some means he gets a\r\nconsiderable sum from Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, he does nothing but\r\nget drunk, and instead of gratitude ends by impudently defying Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch, making senseless demands, threatening him with\r\nproceedings if the pension is not paid straight into his hands.","So\r\nhe takes what is a voluntary gift from Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch as a\r\ntax--can you imagine it? Mr. Lebyadkin, is that all true that I have\r\nsaid just now?\"\r\n\r\nThe captain, who had till that moment stood in silence looking down,\r\ntook two rapid steps forward and turned crimson.\r\n\r\n\"Pyotr Stepanovitch, you've treated me cruelly,\" he brought out\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n\"Why cruelly? How? But allow us to discuss the question of cruelty or\r\ngentleness later on.","Now answer my first question; is it true all that I\r\nhave said or not? If you consider it's false you are at liberty to give\r\nyour own version at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"I... you know yourself, Pyotr Stepanovitch,\" the captain muttered, but\r\nhe could not go on and relapsed into silence. It must be observed that\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch was sitting in an easy chair with one leg crossed\r\nover the other, while the captain stood before him in the most\r\nrespectful attitude.","Lebyadkin's hesitation seemed to annoy Pyotr Stepanovitch; a spasm of\r\nanger distorted his face.\r\n\r\n\"Then you have a statement you want to make?\" he said, looking subtly at\r\nthe captain. \"Kindly speak. We're waiting for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know yourself Pyotr Stepanovitch, that I can't say anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't know it. It's the first time I've heard it. Why can't you\r\nspeak?\"\r\n\r\nThe captain was silent, with his eyes on the ground.","\"Allow me to go, Pyotr Stepanovitch,\" he brought out resolutely.\r\n\r\n\"No, not till you answer my question: is it all true that I've said?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" Lebyadkin brought out in a hollow voice, looking at his\r\ntormentor. Drops of perspiration stood out on his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Is it _all_ true?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all true.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you nothing to add or to observe? If you think that we've been\r\nunjust, say so; protest, state your grievance aloud.","\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I think nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you threaten Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch lately?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was... it was more drink than anything, Pyotr Stepanovitch.\" He\r\nsuddenly raised his head. \"If family honour and undeserved disgrace\r\ncry out among men then--then is a man to blame?\" he roared suddenly,\r\nforgetting himself as before.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sober now, Mr. Lebyadkin?\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch looked at him penetratingly.","\"I am... sober.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by family honour and undeserved disgrace?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mean anybody, anybody at all. I meant myself,\" the captain\r\nsaid, collapsing again.\r\n\r\n\"You seem to be very much offended by what I've said about you and your\r\nconduct? You are very irritable, Mr. Lebyadkin. But let me tell you I've\r\nhardly begun yet what I've got to say about your conduct, in its real\r\nsense.","I'll begin to discuss your conduct in its real sense. I shall\r\nbegin, that may very well happen, but so far I've not begun, in a real\r\nsense.\"\r\n\r\nLebyadkin started and stared wildly at Pyotr Stepanovitch.\r\n\r\n\"Pyotr Stepanovitch, I am just beginning to wake up.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm! And it's I who have waked you up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's you who have waked me, Pyotr Stepanovitch; and I've been\r\nasleep for the last four years with a storm-cloud hanging over me.","May I\r\nwithdraw at last, Pyotr Stepanovitch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now you may, unless Varvara Petrovna thinks it necessary...\"\r\n\r\nBut the latter dismissed him with a wave of her hand.\r\n\r\nThe captain bowed, took two steps towards the door, stopped suddenly,\r\nlaid his hand on his heart, tried to say something, did not say it, and\r\nwas moving quickly away. But in the doorway he came face to face with\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch; the latter stood aside.","The captain shrank into\r\nhimself, as it were, before him, and stood as though frozen to the spot,\r\nhis eyes fixed upon him like a rabbit before a boa-constrictor. After\r\na little pause Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch waved him aside with a slight\r\nmotion of his hand, and walked into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nHe was cheerful and serene. Perhaps something very pleasant had happened\r\nto him, of which we knew nothing as yet; but he seemed particularly\r\ncontented.","\"Do you forgive me, Nicolas?\" Varvara Petrovna hastened to say, and got\r\nup suddenly to meet him.\r\n\r\nBut Nicolas positively laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Just as I thought,\" he said, good-humouredly and jestingly. \"I see you\r\nknow all about it already. When I had gone from here I reflected in the\r\ncarriage that I ought at least to have told you the story instead of\r\ngoing off like that. But when I remembered that Pyotr Stepanovitch was\r\nstill here, I thought no more of it.","\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he took a cursory look round.\r\n\r\n\"Pyotr Stepanovitch told us an old Petersburg episode in the life of a\r\nqueer fellow,\" Varvara Petrovna rejoined enthusiastically--\"a mad\r\nand capricious fellow, though always lofty in his feelings, always\r\nchivalrous and noble....\"\r\n\r\n\"Chivalrous? You don't mean to say it's come to that,\" laughed Nicolas.\r\n\"However, I'm very grateful to Pyotr Stepanovitch for being in such a\r\nhurry this time.","\" He exchanged a rapid glance with the latter. \"You must\r\nknow, maman, that Pyotr Stepanovitch is the universal peacemaker; that's\r\nhis part in life, his weakness, his hobby, and I particularly recommend\r\nhim to you from that point of view. I can guess what a yarn he's\r\nbeen spinning. He's a great hand at spinning them; he has a perfect\r\nrecord-office in his head. He's such a realist, you know, that he can't\r\ntell a lie, and prefers truthfulness to effect.",".. except, of course,\r\nin special cases when effect is more important than truth.\" (As he said\r\nthis he was still looking about him.) \"So, you see clearly, maman, that\r\nit's not for you to ask my forgiveness, and if there's any craziness\r\nabout this affair it's my fault, and it proves that, when all's said and\r\ndone, I really am mad.... I must keep up my character here....\"\r\n\r\nThen he tenderly embraced his mother.","\"In any case the subject has been fully discussed and is done with,\"\r\nhe added, and there was a rather dry and resolute note in his voice.\r\nVarvara Petrovna understood that note, but her exaltation was not\r\ndamped, quite the contrary.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't expect you for another month, Nicolas!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will explain everything to you, maman, of course, but now...\"\r\n\r\nAnd he went towards Praskovya Ivanovna.","But she scarcely turned her head towards him, though she had been\r\ncompletely overwhelmed by his first appearance. Now she had fresh\r\nanxieties to think of; at the moment the captain had stumbled upon\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch as he was going out, Liza had suddenly begun\r\nlaughing--at first quietly and intermittently, but her laughter grew\r\nmore and more violent, louder and more conspicuous. She flushed crimson,\r\nin striking contrast with her gloomy expression just before.","While Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was talking to Varvara Petrovna, she had\r\ntwice beckoned to Mavriky Nikolaevitch as though she wanted to whisper\r\nsomething to him; but as soon as the young man bent down to her, she\r\ninstantly burst into laughter; so that it seemed as though it was at\r\npoor Mavriky Nikolaevitch that she was laughing. She evidently tried to\r\ncontrol herself, however, and put her handkerchief to her lips.","Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch turned to greet her with a most innocent and\r\nopen-hearted air.\r\n\r\n\"Please excuse me,\" she responded, speaking quickly. \"You... you've seen\r\nMavriky Nikolaevitch of course.... My goodness, how inexcusably tall you\r\nare, Mavriky Nikolaevitch!\"\r\n\r\nAnd laughter again, Mavriky Nikolaevitch was tall, but by no means\r\ninexcusably so.\r\n\r\n\"Have... you been here long?\" she muttered, restraining herself again,\r\ngenuinely embarrassed though her eyes were shining.","\"More than two hours,\" answered Nicolas, looking at her intently. I may\r\nremark that he was exceptionally reserved and courteous, but that apart\r\nfrom his courtesy his expression was utterly indifferent, even listless.\r\n\r\n\"And where are you going to stay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here.\"\r\n\r\nVarvara Petrovna, too, was watching Liza, but she was suddenly struck by\r\nan idea.\r\n\r\n\"Where have you been all this time, Nicolas, more than two hours?\" she\r\nsaid, going up to him.","\"The train comes in at ten o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"I first took Pyotr Stepanovitch to Kirillov's. I came across Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch at Matveyev (three stations away), and we travelled\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had been waiting at Matveyev since sunrise,\" put in Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch. \"The last carriages of our train ran off the rails in the\r\nnight, and we nearly had our legs broken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your legs broken!\" cried Liza.","\"Maman, maman, you and I meant to go to\r\nMatveyev last week, we should have broken our legs too!\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven have mercy on us!\" cried Praskovya Ivanovna, crossing herself.\r\n\r\n\"Maman, maman, dear maman, you mustn't be frightened if I break both my\r\nlegs. It may so easily happen to me; you say yourself that I ride so\r\nrecklessly every day. Mavriky Nikolaevitch, will you go about with me\r\nwhen I'm lame?\" She began giggling again.","\"If it does happen I won't let\r\nanyone take me about but you, you can reckon on that.... Well, suppose I\r\nbreak only one leg. Come, be polite, say you'll think it a pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"A pleasure to be crippled?\" said Mavriky Nikolaevitch, frowning\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n\"But then you'll lead me about, only you and no one else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even then it'll be you leading me about, Lizaveta Nikolaevna,\"\r\nmurmured Mavriky Nikolaevitch, even more gravely.","\"Why, he's trying to make a joke!\" cried Liza, almost in dismay.\r\n\"Mavriky Nikolaevitch, don't you ever dare take to that! But what an\r\negoist you are! I am certain that, to your credit, you're slandering\r\nyourself. It will be quite the contrary; from morning till night you'll\r\nassure me that I have become more charming for having lost my leg.\r\nThere's one insurmountable difficulty--you're so fearfully tall, and\r\nwhen I've lost my leg I shall be so very tiny.","How will you be able to\r\ntake me on your arm; we shall look a strange couple!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she laughed hysterically. Her jests and insinuations were feeble,\r\nbut she was not capable of considering the effect she was producing.\r\n\r\n\"Hysterics!\" Pyotr Stepanovitch whispered to me. \"A glass of water, make\r\nhaste!\"\r\n\r\nHe was right. A minute later every one was fussing about, water was\r\nbrought. Liza embraced her mother, kissed her warmly, wept on her\r\nshoulder, then drawing back and looking her in the face she fell to\r\nlaughing again.","The mother too began whimpering. Varvara Petrovna made\r\nhaste to carry them both off to her own rooms, going out by the same\r\ndoor by which Darya Pavlovna had come to us. But they were not away\r\nlong, not more than four minutes.\r\n\r\nI am trying to remember now every detail of these last moments of that\r\nmemorable morning. I remember that when we were left without the ladies\r\n(except Darya Pavlovna, who had not moved from her seat), Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch made the round, greeting us all except Shatov, who still\r\nsat in his corner, his head more bowed than ever.","Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nwas beginning something very witty to Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, but the\r\nlatter turned away hurriedly to Darya Pavlovna. But before he reached\r\nher, Pyotr Stepanovitch caught him and drew him away, almost violently,\r\ntowards the window, where he whispered something quickly to him,\r\napparently something very important to judge by the expression of\r\nhis face and the gestures that accompanied the whisper.","Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch listened inattentively and listlessly with his official\r\nsmile, and at last even impatiently, and seemed all the time on the\r\npoint of breaking away. He moved away from the window just as the ladies\r\ncame back. Varvara Petrovna made Liza sit down in the same seat as\r\nbefore, declaring that she must wait and rest another ten minutes; and\r\nthat the fresh air would perhaps be too much for her nerves at once.","She was looking after Liza with great devotion, and sat down beside\r\nher. Pyotr Stepanovitch, now disengaged, skipped up to them at once,\r\nand broke into a rapid and lively flow of conversation. At that point\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch at last went up to Darya Pavlovna with his\r\nleisurely step. Dasha began stirring uneasily at his approach, and\r\njumped up quickly in evident embarrassment, flushing all over her face.","\"I believe one may congratulate you... or is it too soon?\" he brought\r\nout with a peculiar line in his face.\r\n\r\nDasha made him some answer, but it was difficult to catch it.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive my indiscretion,\" he added, raising his voice, \"but you know I\r\nwas expressly informed. Did you know about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know that you were expressly informed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I hope I have not done any harm by my congratulations,\" he laughed.","\"And if Stepan Trofimovitch...\"\r\n\r\n\"What, what's the congratulation about?\" Pyotr Stepanovitch suddenly\r\nskipped up to them. \"What are you being congratulated about, Darya\r\nPavlovna? Bah! Surely that's not it? Your blush proves I've guessed\r\nright. And indeed, what else does one congratulate our charming and\r\nvirtuous young ladies on? And what congratulations make them blush most\r\nreadily? Well, accept mine too, then, if I've guessed right! And pay\r\nup.","Do you remember when we were in Switzerland you bet you'd never be\r\nmarried.... Oh, yes, apropos of Switzerland--what am I thinking about?\r\nOnly fancy, that's half what I came about, and I was almost forgetting\r\nit. Tell me,\" he turned quickly to Stepan Trofimovitch, \"when are you\r\ngoing to Switzerland?\"\r\n\r\n\"I... to Switzerland?\" Stepan Trofimovitch replied, wondering and\r\nconfused.\r\n\r\n\"What? Aren't you going? Why you're getting married, too, you wrote?\"\r\n\r\n_\"Pierre!\"_ cried Stepan Trofimovitch.","\"Well, why Pierre?... You see, if that'll please you, I've flown here to\r\nannounce that I'm not at all against it, since you were set on having\r\nmy opinion as quickly as possible; and if, indeed,\" he pattered on, \"you\r\nwant to 'be saved,' as you wrote, beseeching my help in the same letter,\r\nI am at your service again. Is it true that he is going to be married,\r\nVarvara Petrovna?\" He turned quickly to her.","\"I hope I'm not being\r\nindiscreet; he writes himself that the whole town knows it and every\r\none's congratulating him, so that, to avoid it he only goes out at\r\nnight. I've got his letters in my pocket. But would you believe it,\r\nVarvara Petrovna, I can't make head or tail of it? Just tell me one\r\nthing, Stepan Trofimovitch, are you to be congratulated or are you to\r\nbe 'saved'?  You wouldn't believe it; in one line he's despairing and in\r\nthe next he's most joyful.","To begin with he begs my forgiveness; well,\r\nof course, that's their way... though it must be said; fancy, the man's\r\nonly seen me twice in his life and then by accident. And suddenly now,\r\nwhen he's going to be married for the third time, he imagines that\r\nthis is a breach of some sort of parental duty to me, and entreats me a\r\nthousand miles away not to be angry and to allow him to. Please don't\r\nbe hurt, Stepan Trofimovitch.","It's characteristic of your generation,\r\nI take a broad view of it, and don't blame you. And let's admit it does\r\nyou honour and all the rest. But the point is again that I don't see the\r\npoint of it. There's something about some sort of 'sins in Switzerland.'\r\n'I'm getting married,' he says, 'for my sins or on account of the 'sins'\r\nof another,' or whatever it is--'sins' anyway. 'The girl,' says he, 'is\r\na pearl and a diamond,' and, well, of course, he's 'unworthy of her';\r\nit's their way of talking; but on account of some sins or circumstances\r\n'he is obliged to lead her to the altar, and go to Switzerland, and\r\ntherefore abandon everything and fly to save me.","' Do you understand\r\nanything of all that? However... however, I notice from the expression\r\nof your faces\"--(he turned about with the letter in his hand looking\r\nwith an innocent smile into the faces of the company)--\"that, as usual,\r\nI seem to have put my foot in it through my stupid way of being open,\r\nor, as Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch says, 'being in a hurry.' I thought, of\r\ncourse, that we were all friends here, that is, your friends, Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch, your friends.","I am really a stranger, and I see... and I\r\nsee that you all know something, and that just that something I don't\r\nknow.\" He still went on looking about him.\r\n\r\n\"So Stepan Trofimovitch wrote to you that he was getting married for\r\nthe 'sins of another committed in Switzerland,' and that you were to\r\nfly here 'to save him,' in those very words?\" said Varvara Petrovna,\r\naddressing him suddenly. Her face was yellow and distorted, and her lips\r\nwere twitching.","\"Well, you see, if there's anything I've not understood,\" said Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch, as though in alarm, talking more quickly than ever, \"it's\r\nhis fault, of course, for writing like that. Here's the letter. You\r\nknow, Varvara Petrovna, his letters are endless and incessant, and,\r\nyou know, for the last two or three months there has been letter upon\r\nletter, till, I must own, at last I sometimes didn't read them through.","Forgive me, Stepan Trofimovitch, for my foolish confession, but you must\r\nadmit, please, that, though you addressed them to me, you wrote them\r\nmore for posterity, so that you really can't mind.... Come, come, don't\r\nbe offended; we're friends, anyway. But this letter, Varvara Petrovna,\r\nthis letter, I did read through. These 'sins'--these 'sins of\r\nanother'--are probably some little sins of our own, and I don't mind\r\nbetting very innocent ones, though they have suddenly made us take a\r\nfancy to work up a terrible story, with a glamour of the heroic about\r\nit; and it's just for the sake of that glamour we've got it up.","You\r\nsee there's something a little lame about our accounts--it must be\r\nconfessed, in the end. We've a great weakness for cards, you know....\r\nBut this is unnecessary, quite unnecessary, I'm sorry, I chatter too\r\nmuch. But upon my word, Varvara Petrovna, he gave me a fright, and I\r\nreally was half prepared to save him. He really made me feel ashamed.\r\nDid he expect me to hold a knife to his throat, or what? Am I such a\r\nmerciless creditor? He writes something here of a dowry.","... But are you\r\nreally going to get married, Stepan Trofimovitch? That would be just\r\nlike you, to say a lot for the sake of talking. Ach, Varvara Petrovna,\r\nI'm sure you must be blaming me now, and just for my way of talking\r\ntoo....\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, on the contrary, I see that you are driven out of\r\nall patience, and, no doubt you have had good reason,\" Varvara Petrovna\r\nanswered spitefully.","She had listened with spiteful enjoyment to all the\r\n\"candid outbursts\" of Pyotr Stepanovitch, who was obviously playing\r\na part (what part I did not know then, but it was unmistakable, and\r\nover-acted indeed).\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary,\" she went on, \"I'm only too grateful to you for\r\nspeaking; but for you I might not have known of it. My eyes are opened\r\nfor the first time for twenty years. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, you\r\nsaid just now that you had been expressly informed; surely Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch hasn't written to you in the same style?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did get a very harmless and.",".. and... very generous letter from\r\nhim....\"\r\n\r\n\"You hesitate, you pick out your words. That's enough! Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch, I request a great favour from you.\" She suddenly turned to\r\nhim with flashing eyes. \"Kindly leave us at once, and never set foot in\r\nmy house again.\"\r\n\r\nI must beg the reader to remember her recent \"exaltation,\" which had not\r\nyet passed. It's true that Stepan Trofimovitch was terribly to blame!\r\nBut what was a complete surprise to me then was the wonderful dignity of\r\nhis bearing under his son's \"accusation,\" which he had never thought of\r\ninterrupting, and before Varvara Petrovna's \"denunciation.","\" How did he\r\ncome by such spirit? I only found out one thing, that he had certainly\r\nbeen deeply wounded at his first meeting with Petrusha, by the way he\r\nhad embraced him. It was a deep and genuine grief; at least in his eyes\r\nand to his heart. He had another grief at the same time, that is the\r\npoignant consciousness of having acted contemptibly. He admitted this\r\nto me afterwards with perfect openness.","And you know real genuine sorrow\r\nwill sometimes make even a phenomenally frivolous, unstable man solid\r\nand stoical; for a short time at any rate; what's more, even fools are\r\nby genuine sorrow turned into wise men, also only for a short time of\r\ncourse; it is characteristic of sorrow. And if so, what might not\r\nhappen with a man like Stepan Trofimovitch? It worked a complete\r\ntransformation--though also only for a time, of course.","He bowed with dignity to Varvara Petrovna without uttering a word (there\r\nwas nothing else left for him to do, indeed). He was on the point of\r\ngoing out without a word, but could not refrain from approaching Darya\r\nPavlovna. She seemed to foresee that he would do so, for she began\r\nspeaking of her own accord herself, in utter dismay, as though in haste\r\nto anticipate him.\r\n\r\n\"Please, Stepan Trofimovitch, for God's sake, don't say anything,\" she\r\nbegan, speaking with haste and excitement, with a look of pain in her\r\nface, hurriedly stretching out her hands to him.","\"Be sure that I still\r\nrespect you as much... and think just as highly of you, and... think\r\nwell of me too, Stepan Trofimovitch, that will mean a great deal to me,\r\na great deal....\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch made her a very, very low bow.\r\n\r\n\"It's for you to decide, Darya Pavlovna; you know that you are perfectly\r\nfree in the whole matter! You have been, and you are now, and you always\r\nwill be,\" Varvara Petrovna concluded impressively.","\"Bah! Now I understand it all!\" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch, slapping\r\nhimself on the forehead. \"But... but what a position I am put in by\r\nall this! Darya Pavlovna, please forgive me!... What do you call your\r\ntreatment of me, eh?\" he said, addressing his father.\r\n\r\n\"Pierre, you might speak to me differently, mightn't you, my boy,\"\r\nStepan Trofimovitch observed quite quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't cry out, please,\" said Pierre, with a wave of his hand.","\"Believe\r\nme, it's all your sick old nerves, and crying out will do no good at\r\nall. You'd better tell me instead, why didn't you warn me since you\r\nmight have supposed I should speak out at the first chance?\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch looked searchingly at him.\r\n\r\n\"Pierre, you who know so much of what goes on here, can you really have\r\nknown nothing of this business and have heard nothing about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What? What a set! So it's not enough to be a child in your old age,\r\nyou must be a spiteful child too! Varvara Petrovna, did you hear what he\r\nsaid?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a general outcry; but then suddenly an incident took place\r\nwhich no one could have anticipated.","VIII\r\n\r\nFirst of all I must mention that, for the last two or three minutes\r\nLizaveta Nikolaevna had seemed to be possessed by a new impulse; she\r\nwas whispering something hurriedly to her mother, and to Mavriky\r\nNikolaevitch, who bent down to listen. Her face was agitated, but at the\r\nsame time it had a look of resolution. At last she got up from her\r\nseat in evident haste to go away, and hurried her mother whom Mavriky\r\nNikolaevitch began helping up from her low chair.","But it seemed they\r\nwere not destined to get away without seeing everything to the end.\r\n\r\nShatov, who had been forgotten by every one in his corner (not far from\r\nLizaveta Nikolaevna), and who did not seem to know himself why he went\r\non sitting there, got up from his chair, and walked, without haste, with\r\nresolute steps right across the room to Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, looking\r\nhim straight in the face.","The latter noticed him approaching at some\r\ndistance, and faintly smiled, but when Shatov was close to him he left\r\noff smiling.\r\n\r\nWhen Shatov stood still facing him with his eyes fixed on him, and\r\nwithout uttering a word, every one suddenly noticed it and there was a\r\ngeneral hush; Pyotr Stepanovitch was the last to cease speaking. Liza\r\nand her mother were standing in the middle of the room. So passed five\r\nseconds; the look of haughty astonishment was followed by one of anger\r\non Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch's face; he scowled.","...\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly Shatov swung his long, heavy arm, and with all his might\r\nstruck him a blow in the face. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch staggered\r\nviolently.\r\n\r\nShatov struck the blow in a peculiar way, not at all after the\r\nconventional fashion (if one may use such an expression). It was not a\r\nslap with the palm of his hand, but a blow with the whole fist, and it\r\nwas a big, heavy, bony fist covered with red hairs and freckles.","If the\r\nblow had struck the nose, it would have broken it. But it hit him on the\r\ncheek, and struck the left corner of the lip and the upper teeth, from\r\nwhich blood streamed at once.\r\n\r\nI believe there was a sudden scream, perhaps Varvara Petrovna\r\nscreamed--that I don't remember, because there was a dead hush again;\r\nthe whole scene did not last more than ten seconds, however.\r\n\r\nYet a very great deal happened in those seconds.","I must remind the reader again that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch's was one\r\nof those natures that know nothing of fear. At a duel he could face the\r\npistol of his opponent with indifference, and could take aim and kill\r\nwith brutal coolness. If anyone had slapped him in the face, I should\r\nhave expected him not to challenge his assailant to a duel, but to\r\nmurder him on the spot. He was just one of those characters, and would\r\nhave killed the man, knowing very well what he was doing, and without\r\nlosing his self-control.","I fancy, indeed, that he never was liable to\r\nthose fits of blind rage which deprive a man of all power of reflection.\r\nEven when overcome with intense anger, as he sometimes was, he was\r\nalways able to retain complete self-control, and therefore to realise\r\nthat he would certainly be sent to penal servitude for murdering a man\r\nnot in a duel; nevertheless, he'd have killed any one who insulted him,\r\nand without the faintest hesitation.","I have been studying Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch of late, and through\r\nspecial circumstances I know a great many facts about him now, at the\r\ntime I write. I should compare him, perhaps, with some gentlemen of the\r\npast of whom legendary traditions are still perceived among us. We are\r\ntold, for instance, about the Decabrist L--n, that he was always seeking\r\nfor danger, that he revelled in the sensation, and that it had become\r\na craving of his nature; that in his youth he had rushed into duels for\r\nnothing; that in Siberia he used to go to kill bears with nothing but\r\na knife; that in the Siberian forests he liked to meet with runaway\r\nconvicts, who are, I may observe in passing, more formidable than bears.","There is no doubt that these legendary gentlemen were capable of a\r\nfeeling of fear, and even to an extreme degree, perhaps, or they would\r\nhave been a great deal quieter, and a sense of danger would never have\r\nbecome a physical craving with them. But the conquest of fear was\r\nwhat fascinated them. The continual ecstasy of vanquishing and the\r\nconsciousness that no one could vanquish them was what attracted them.","The same L---n struggled with hunger for some time before he was sent\r\ninto exile, and toiled to earn his daily bread simply because he did not\r\ncare to comply with the requests of his rich father, which he considered\r\nunjust. So his conception of struggle was many-sided, and he did not\r\nprize stoicism and strength of character only in duels and bear-fights.\r\n\r\nBut many years have passed since those times, and the nervous,\r\nexhausted, complex character of the men of to-day is incompatible with\r\nthe craving for those direct and unmixed sensations which were so sought\r\nafter by some restlessly active gentlemen of the good old days.","Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch would, perhaps, have looked down on L--n, and have\r\ncalled him a boastful cock-a-hoop coward; it's true he wouldn't have\r\nexpressed himself aloud. Stavrogin would have shot his opponent in a\r\nduel, and would have faced a bear if necessary, and would have defended\r\nhimself from a brigand in the forest as successfully and as fearlessly\r\nas L--n, but it would be without the slightest thrill of enjoyment,\r\nlanguidly, listlessly, even with ennui and entirely from unpleasant\r\nnecessity.","In anger, of course, there has been a progress compared with\r\nL--n, even compared with Lermontov. There was perhaps more malignant\r\nanger in Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch than in both put together, but it was a\r\ncalm, cold, if one may so say, _reasonable_ anger, and therefore the most\r\nrevolting and most terrible possible. I repeat again, I considered him\r\nthen, and I still consider him (now that everything is over), a man who,\r\nif he received a slap in the face, or any equivalent insult, would be\r\ncertain to kill his assailant at once, on the spot, without challenging\r\nhim.","Yet, in the present case, what happened was something different and\r\namazing.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely regained his balance after being almost knocked over in\r\nthis humiliating way, and the horrible, as it were, sodden, thud of\r\nthe blow in the face had scarcely died away in the room when he seized\r\nShatov by the shoulders with both hands, but at once, almost at the same\r\ninstant, pulled both hands away and clasped them behind his back.","He did\r\nnot speak, but looked at Shatov, and turned as white as his shirt. But,\r\nstrange to say, the light in his eyes seemed to die out. Ten seconds\r\nlater his eyes looked cold, and I'm sure I'm not lying--calm. Only he\r\nwas terribly pale. Of course I don't know what was passing within the\r\nman, I saw only his exterior. It seems to me that if a man should snatch\r\nup a bar of red-hot iron and hold it tight in his hand to test his\r\nfortitude, and after struggling for ten seconds with insufferable pain\r\nend by overcoming it, such a man would, I fancy, go through something\r\nlike what Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was enduring during those ten seconds.","Shatov was the first to drop his eyes, and evidently because he was\r\nunable to go on facing him; then he turned slowly and walked out of the\r\nroom, but with a very different step. He withdrew quietly, with peculiar\r\nawkwardness, with his shoulders hunched, his head hanging as though\r\nhe were inwardly pondering something. I believe he was whispering\r\nsomething. He made his way to the door carefully, without stumbling\r\nagainst anything or knocking anything over; he opened the door a very\r\nlittle way, and squeezed through almost sideways.","As he went out his\r\nshock of hair standing on end at the back of his head was particularly\r\nnoticeable.\r\n\r\nThen first of all one fearful scream was heard. I saw Lizaveta\r\nNikolaevna seize her mother by the shoulder and Mavriky Nikolaevitch by\r\nthe arm and make two or three violent efforts to draw them out of the\r\nroom. But she suddenly uttered a shriek, and fell full length on the\r\nfloor, fainting.","I can hear the thud of her head on the carpet to this\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nEIGHT DAYS HAD PASSED. Now that it is all over and I am writing a record\r\nof it, we know all about it; but at the time we knew nothing, and it was\r\nnatural that many things should seem strange to us: Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nand I, anyway, shut ourselves up for the first part of the time, and\r\nlooked on with dismay from a distance.","I did, indeed, go about here and\r\nthere, and, as before, brought him various items of news, without which\r\nhe could not exist.\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that there were rumours of the most varied kind\r\ngoing about the town in regard to the blow that Stavrogin had received,\r\nLizaveta Nikolaevna's fainting fit, and all that happened on that\r\nSunday. But what we wondered was, through whom the story had got about\r\nso quickly and so accurately.","Not one of the persons present had any\r\nneed to give away the secret of what had happened, or interest to serve\r\nby doing so.\r\n\r\nThe servants had not been present. Lebyadkin was the only one who might\r\nhave chattered, not so much from spite, for he had gone out in great\r\nalarm (and fear of an enemy destroys spite against him), but simply from\r\nincontinence of speech. But Lebyadkin and his sister had disappeared next\r\nday, and nothing could be heard of them.","There was no trace of them at\r\nFilipov's house, they had moved, no one knew where, and seemed to have\r\nvanished. Shatov, of whom I wanted to inquire about Marya Timofyevna,\r\nwould not open his door, and I believe sat locked up in his room for the\r\nwhole of those eight days, even discontinuing his work in the town. He\r\nwould not see me. I went to see him on Tuesday and knocked at his door.\r\nI got no answer, but being convinced by unmistakable evidence that he\r\nwas at home, I knocked a second time.","Then, jumping up, apparently from\r\nhis bed, he strode to the door and shouted at the top of his voice:\r\n\r\n\"Shatov is not at home!\"\r\n\r\nWith that I went away.\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch and I, not without dismay at the boldness of the\r\nsupposition, though we tried to encourage one another, reached at last\r\na conclusion: we made up our mind that the only person who could be\r\nresponsible for spreading these rumours was Pyotr Stepanovitch, though\r\nhe himself not long after assured his father that he had found the story\r\non every one's lips, especially at the club, and that the governor\r\nand his wife were familiar with every detail of it.","What is even more\r\nremarkable is that the next day, Monday evening, I met Liputin, and\r\nhe knew every word that had been passed, so that he must have heard it\r\nfirst-hand. Many of the ladies (and some of the leading ones) were\r\nvery inquisitive about the \"mysterious cripple,\" as they called Marya\r\nTimofyevna. There were some, indeed, who were anxious to see her and\r\nmake her acquaintance, so the intervention of the persons who had\r\nbeen in such haste to conceal the Lebyadkins was timely.","But Lizaveta\r\nNikolaevna's fainting certainly took the foremost place in the story,\r\nand \"all society\" was interested, if only because it directly concerned\r\nYulia Mihailovna, as the kinswoman and patroness of the young lady.\r\nAnd what was there they didn't say! What increased the gossip was the\r\nmysterious position of affairs; both houses were obstinately closed;\r\nLizaveta Nikolaevna, so they said, was in bed with brain fever.","The\r\nsame thing was asserted of Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, with the revolting\r\naddition of a tooth knocked out and a swollen face. It was even\r\nwhispered in corners that there would soon be murder among us, that\r\nStavrogin was not the man to put up with such an insult, and that he\r\nwould kill Shatov, but with the secrecy of a Corsican vendetta. People\r\nliked this idea, but the majority of our young people listened with\r\ncontempt, and with an air of the most nonchalant indifference, which\r\nwas, of course, assumed.","The old hostility to Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch\r\nin the town was in general strikingly manifest. Even sober-minded people\r\nwere eager to throw blame on him though they could not have said\r\nfor what. It was whispered that he had ruined Lizaveta Nikolaevna's\r\nreputation, and that there had been an intrigue between them in\r\nSwitzerland. Cautious people, of course, restrained themselves, but\r\nall listened with relish.","There were other things said, though not\r\nin public, but in private, on rare occasions and almost in secret,\r\nextremely strange things, to which I only refer to warn my readers of\r\nthem with a view to the later events of my story. Some people, with\r\nknitted brows, said, God knows on what foundation, that Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch had some special business in our province, that he\r\nhad, through Count K.",", been brought into touch with exalted circles in\r\nPetersburg, that he was even, perhaps, in government service, and might\r\nalmost be said to have been furnished with some sort of commission from\r\nsomeone. When very sober-minded and sensible people smiled at this\r\nrumour, observing very reasonably that a man always mixed up with\r\nscandals, and who was beginning his career among us with a swollen face\r\ndid not look like a government official, they were told in a whisper\r\nthat he was employed not in the official, but, so to say, the\r\nconfidential service, and that in such cases it was essential to be as\r\nlittle like an official as possible.","This remark produced a sensation;\r\nwe knew that the Zemstvo of our province was the object of marked\r\nattention in the capital. I repeat, these were only flitting rumours\r\nthat disappeared for a time when Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch first came\r\namong us. But I may observe that many of the rumours were partly due to\r\na few brief but malicious words, vaguely and disconnectedly dropped at\r\nthe club by a gentleman who had lately returned from Petersburg.","This\r\nwas a retired captain in the guards, Artemy Pavlovitch Gaganov. He was\r\na very large landowner in our province and district, a man used to the\r\nsociety of Petersburg, and a son of the late Pavel Pavlovitch Gaganov,\r\nthe venerable old man with whom Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had, over four\r\nyears before, had the extraordinarily coarse and sudden encounter which\r\nI have described already in the beginning of my story.","It immediately became known to every one that Yulia Mihailovna had\r\nmade a special call on Varvara Petrovna, and had been informed at the\r\nentrance: \"Her honour was too unwell to see visitors.\" It was known,\r\ntoo, that Yulia Mihailovna sent a message two days later to inquire\r\nafter Varvara Petrovna's health. At last she began \"defending\" Varvara\r\nPetrovna everywhere, of course only in the loftiest sense, that is, in\r\nthe vaguest possible way.","She listened coldly and sternly to the hurried\r\nremarks made at first about the scene on Sunday, so that during the\r\nlater days they were not renewed in her presence. So that the belief\r\ngained ground everywhere that Yulia Mihailovna knew not only the whole\r\nof the mysterious story but all its secret significance to the smallest\r\ndetail, and not as an outsider, but as one taking part in it. I may\r\nobserve, by the way, that she was already gradually beginning to gain\r\nthat exalted influence among us for which she was so eager and which\r\nshe was certainly struggling to win, and was already beginning to see\r\nherself \"surrounded by a circle.","\" A section of society recognised her\r\npractical sense and tact... but of that later. Her patronage partly\r\nexplained Pyotr Stepanovitch's rapid success in our society--a success\r\nwith which Stepan Trofimovitch was particularly impressed at the time.\r\n\r\nWe possibly exaggerated it. To begin with, Pyotr Stepanovitch seemed to\r\nmake acquaintance almost instantly with the whole town within the first\r\nfour days of his arrival.","He only arrived on Sunday; and on Tuesday\r\nI saw him in a carriage with Artemy Pavlovitch Gaganov, a man who was\r\nproud, irritable, and supercilious, in spite of his good breeding,\r\nand who was not easy to get on with. At the governor's, too, Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch met with a warm welcome, so much so that he was at once\r\non an intimate footing, like a young friend, treated, so to say,\r\naffectionately.","He dined with Yulia Mihailovna almost every day. He had\r\nmade her acquaintance in Switzerland, but there was certainly something\r\ncurious about the rapidity of his success in the governor's house. In\r\nany case he was reputed, whether truly or not, to have been at one\r\ntime a revolutionist abroad, he had had something to do with some\r\npublications and some congresses abroad, \"which one can prove from the\r\nnewspapers,\" to quote the malicious remark of Alyosha Telyatnikov, who\r\nhad also been once a young friend affectionately treated in the house of\r\nthe late governor, but was now, alas, a clerk on the retired list.","But\r\nthe fact was unmistakable: the former revolutionist, far from being\r\nhindered from returning to his beloved Fatherland, seemed almost to have\r\nbeen encouraged to do so, so perhaps there was nothing in it. Liputin\r\nwhispered to me once that there were rumours that Pyotr Stepanovitch had\r\nonce professed himself penitent, and on his return had been pardoned on\r\nmentioning certain names and so, perhaps, had succeeded in expiating his\r\noffence, by promising to be of use to the government in the future.","I\r\nrepeated these malignant phrases to Stepan Trofimovitch, and although\r\nthe latter was in such a state that he was hardly capable of reflection,\r\nhe pondered profoundly. It turned out later that Pyotr Stepanovitch had\r\ncome to us with a very influential letter of recommendation, that\r\nhe had, at any rate, brought one to the governor's wife from a very\r\nimportant old lady in Petersburg, whose husband was one of the most\r\ndistinguished old dignitaries in the capital.","This old lady, who was\r\nYulia Mihailovna's godmother, mentioned in her letter that Count K. knew\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch very well through Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, made much\r\nof him, and thought him \"a very excellent young man in spite of his\r\nformer errors.\" Yulia Mihailovna set the greatest value on her\r\nrelations with the \"higher spheres,\" which were few and maintained with\r\ndifficulty, and was, no doubt, pleased to get the old lady's letter, but\r\nstill there was something peculiar about it.","She even forced her husband\r\nupon a familiar footing with Pyotr Stepanovitch, so much so that Mr. von\r\nLembke complained of it... but of that, too, later. I may mention,\r\ntoo, that the great author was also favourably disposed to Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch, and at once invited him to go and see him. Such alacrity\r\non the part of a man so puffed up with conceit stung Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nmore painfully than anything; but I put a different interpretation on\r\nit.","In inviting a nihilist to see him, Mr. Karmazinov, no doubt, had in\r\nview his relations with the progressives of the younger generation\r\nin both capitals. The great author trembled nervously before the\r\nrevolutionary youth of Russia, and imagining, in his ignorance, that the\r\nfuture lay in their hands, fawned upon them in a despicable way, chiefly\r\nbecause they paid no attention to him whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch ran round to see his father twice, but unfortunately\r\nI was absent on both occasions.","He visited him for the first time\r\nonly on Wednesday, that is, not till the fourth day after their first\r\nmeeting, and then only on business. Their difficulties over the property\r\nwere settled, by the way, without fuss or publicity. Varvara Petrovna\r\ntook it all on herself, and paid all that was owing, taking over the\r\nland, of course, and only informed Stepan Trofimovitch that it was all\r\nsettled and her butler, Alexey Yegorytch, was, by her authorisation,\r\nbringing him something to sign.","This Stepan Trofimovitch did, in\r\nsilence, with extreme dignity. Apropos of his dignity, I may mention\r\nthat I hardly recognised my old friend during those days. He behaved\r\nas he had never done before; became amazingly taciturn and had not even\r\nwritten one letter to Varvara Petrovna since Sunday, which seemed to me\r\nalmost a miracle. What's more, he had become quite calm. He had fastened\r\nupon a final and decisive idea which gave him tranquillity.","That was\r\nevident. He had hit upon this idea, and sat still, expecting something.\r\nAt first, however, he was ill, especially on Monday. He had an attack\r\nof his summer cholera. He could not remain all that time without news\r\neither; but as soon as I departed from the statement of facts, and began\r\ndiscussing the case in itself, and formulated any theory, he at once\r\ngesticulated to me to stop. But both his interviews with his son had a\r\ndistressing effect on him, though they did not shake his determination.","After each interview he spent the whole day lying on the sofa with a\r\nhandkerchief soaked in vinegar on his head. But he continued to remain\r\ncalm in the deepest sense.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, he did not hinder my speaking. Sometimes, too, it\r\nseemed to me that the mysterious determination he had taken seemed to\r\nbe failing him and he appeared to be struggling with a new, seductive\r\nstream of ideas.","That was only at moments, but I made a note of it. I\r\nsuspected that he was longing to assert himself again, to come forth\r\nfrom his seclusion, to show fight, to struggle to the last.\r\n\r\n\"_Cher,_ I could crush them!\" broke from him on Thursday evening after his\r\nsecond interview with Pyotr Stepanovitch, when he lay stretched on the\r\nsofa with his head wrapped in a towel.\r\n\r\nTill that moment he had not uttered one word all day.","_\"Fils, fils, cher,\"_ and so on, \"I agree all those expressions are\r\nnonsense, kitchen talk, and so be it. I see it for myself. I never gave\r\nhim food or drink, I sent him a tiny baby from Berlin to X province by\r\npost, and all that, I admit it.... 'You gave me neither food nor drink,\r\nand sent me by post,' he says, 'and what's more you've robbed me here.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'But you unhappy boy,' I cried to him, 'my heart has been aching for\r\nyou all my life; though I did send you by post.","' _Il rit._\"\r\n\r\n\"But I admit it. I admit it, granted it was by post,\" he concluded,\r\nalmost in delirium.\r\n\r\n_\"Passons,\"_ he began again, five minutes later. \"I don't understand\r\nTurgenev. That Bazarov of his is a fictitious figure, it does not exist\r\nanywhere. The fellows themselves were the first to disown him as unlike\r\nanyone. That Bazarov is a sort of indistinct mixture of Nozdryov and\r\nByron, _c'est le mot.","_ Look at them attentively: they caper about and\r\nsqueal with joy like puppies in the sun. They are happy, they are\r\nvictorious! What is there of Byron in them!... and with that, such\r\nordinariness! What a low-bred, irritable vanity! What an abject craving\r\nto _faire du bruit autour de son nom,_ without noticing that _son\r\nnom...._ Oh, it's a caricature! 'Surely,' I cried to him, 'you don't want\r\nto offer yourself just as you are as a substitute for Christ?' _Il rit.","Il rit beaucoup. Il rit trop._ He has a strange smile. His mother had not\r\na smile like that. _Il rit toujours._\"\r\n\r\nSilence followed again.\r\n\r\n\"They are cunning; they were acting in collusion on Sunday,\" he blurted\r\nout suddenly....\r\n\r\n\"Oh, not a doubt of it,\" I cried, pricking up my ears. \"It was a got-up\r\nthing and it was too transparent, and so badly acted.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean that. Do you know that it was all too transparent\r\non purpose, that those.",".. who had to, might understand it. Do you\r\nunderstand that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Tant mieux; passons._ I am very irritable to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why have you been arguing with him, Stepan Trofimovitch?\" I asked\r\nhim reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\"_Je voulais convertir_--you'll laugh of course--_cette pauvre_ auntie,\r\n_elle entendra de belles choses!_ Oh, my dear boy, would you believe it.\r\nI felt like a patriot.","I always recognised that I was a Russian,\r\nhowever... a genuine Russian must be like you and me. _Il y a l√† dedans\r\nquelque chose d'aveugle et de louche._\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a doubt of it,\" I assented.\r\n\r\n\"My dear, the real truth always sounds improbable, do you know that? To\r\nmake truth sound probable you must always mix in some falsehood with it.\r\nMen have always done so. Perhaps there's something in it that passes our\r\nunderstanding.","What do you think: is there something we don't understand\r\nin that triumphant squeal? I should like to think there was. I should\r\nlike to think so.\"\r\n\r\nI did not speak. He, too, was silent for a long time. \"They say that\r\nFrench cleverness...\" he babbled suddenly, as though in a fever...\r\n\"that's false, it always has been. Why libel French cleverness? It's\r\nsimply Russian indolence, our degrading impotence to produce ideas, our\r\nrevolting parasitism in the rank of nations.","_Ils sont tout simplement\r\ndes paresseux,_ and not French cleverness. Oh, the Russians ought to be\r\nextirpated for the good of humanity, like noxious parasites! We've been\r\nstriving for something utterly, utterly different. I can make nothing of\r\nit. I have given up understanding. 'Do you understand,' I cried to him,\r\n'that if you have the guillotine in the foreground of your programme and\r\nare so enthusiastic about it too, it's simply because nothing's easier\r\nthan cutting off heads, and nothing's harder than to have an idea.","_Vous\r\n√™tes des paresseux! Votre drapeau est un guenille, une impuissance._ It's\r\nthose carts, or, what was it?... the rumble of the carts carrying bread\r\nto humanity being more important than the Sistine Madonna, or, what's\r\nthe saying?... _une b√™tise dans ce genre._ Don't you understand, don't you\r\nunderstand,' I said to him, 'that unhappiness is just as necessary to\r\nman as happiness.' _Il rit.","_ 'All you do is to make a _bon mot,_' he\r\nsaid, 'with your limbs snug on a velvet sofa.'... (He used a coarser\r\nexpression.) And this habit of addressing a father so familiarly is very\r\nnice when father and son are on good terms, but what do you think of it\r\nwhen they are abusing one another?\"\r\n\r\nWe were silent again for a minute.\r\n\r\n_\"Cher,\"_ he concluded at last, getting up quickly, \"do you know this is\r\nbound to end in something?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said I.","\"_Vous ne comprenez pas. Passons._ But... usually in our world things come\r\nto nothing, but this will end in something; it's bound to, it's bound\r\nto!\"\r\n\r\nHe got up, and walked across the room in violent emotion, and coming\r\nback to the sofa sank on to it exhausted.\r\n\r\nOn Friday morning, Pyotr Stepanovitch went off somewhere in the\r\nneighbourhood, and remained away till Monday. I heard of his departure\r\nfrom Liputin, and in the course of conversation I learned that the\r\nLebyadkins, brother and sister, had moved to the riverside quarter.","\"I moved them,\" he added, and, dropping the Lebyadkins, he suddenly\r\nannounced to me that Lizaveta Nikolaevna was going to marry Mavriky\r\nNikolaevitch, that, although it had not been announced, the engagement\r\nwas a settled thing. Next day I met Lizaveta Nikolaevna out riding with\r\nMavriky Nikolaevitch; she was out for the first time after her illness.\r\nShe beamed at me from the distance, laughed, and nodded in a very\r\nfriendly way.","I told all this to Stepan Trofimovitch; he paid no\r\nattention, except to the news about the Lebyadkins.\r\n\r\nAnd now, having described our enigmatic position throughout those eight\r\ndays during which we knew nothing, I will pass on to the description of\r\nthe succeeding incidents of my chronicle, writing, so to say, with full\r\nknowledge, and describing things as they became known afterwards, and\r\nare clearly seen to-day.","I will begin with the eighth day after that\r\nSunday, that is, the Monday evening--for in reality a \"new scandal\"\r\nbegan with that evening.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIt was seven o'clock in the evening. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was sitting\r\nalone in his study--the room he had been fond of in old days. It was\r\nlofty, carpeted with rugs, and contained somewhat heavy old-fashioned\r\nfurniture. He was sitting on the sofa in the corner, dressed as though\r\nto go out, though he did not seem to be intending to do so.","On the table\r\nbefore him stood a lamp with a shade. The sides and corners of the big\r\nroom were left in shadow. His eyes looked dreamy and concentrated,\r\nnot altogether tranquil; his face looked tired and had grown a little\r\nthinner. He really was ill with a swollen face; but the story of a tooth\r\nhaving been knocked out was an exaggeration. One had been loosened, but\r\nit had grown into its place again: he had had a cut on the inner side of\r\nthe upper lip, but that, too, had healed.","The swelling on his face had\r\nlasted all the week simply because the invalid would not have a doctor,\r\nand instead of having the swelling lanced had waited for it to go down.\r\nHe would not hear of a doctor, and would scarcely allow even his mother\r\nto come near him, and then only for a moment, once a day, and only at\r\ndusk, after it was dark and before lights had been brought in. He did\r\nnot receive Pyotr Stepanovitch either, though the latter ran round to\r\nVarvara Petrovna's two or three times a day so long as he remained in\r\nthe town.","And now, at last, returning on the Monday morning after his\r\nthree days' absence, Pyotr Stepanovitch made a circuit of the town,\r\nand, after dining at Yulia Mihailovna's, came at last in the evening to\r\nVarvara Petrovna, who was impatiently expecting him. The interdict had\r\nbeen removed, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was \"at home.\" Varvara Petrovna\r\nherself led the visitor to the door of the study; she had long looked\r\nforward to their meeting, and Pyotr Stepanovitch had promised to run\r\nto her and repeat what passed.","She knocked timidly at Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch's door, and getting no answer ventured to open the door\r\na couple of inches.\r\n\r\n\"Nicolas, may I bring Pyotr Stepanovitch in to see you?\" she asked, in a\r\nsoft and restrained voice, trying to make out her son's face behind the\r\nlamp.\r\n\r\n\"You can--you can, of course you can,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch himself cried\r\nout, loudly and gaily. He opened the door with his hand and went in.","Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had not heard the knock at the door, and only\r\ncaught his mother's timid question, and had not had time to answer it.\r\nBefore him, at that moment, there lay a letter he had just read over,\r\nwhich he was pondering deeply. He started, hearing Pyotr Stepanovitch's\r\nsudden outburst, and hurriedly put the letter under a paper-weight,\r\nbut did not quite succeed; a corner of the letter and almost the whole\r\nenvelope showed.","\"I called out on purpose that you might be prepared,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\nsaid hurriedly, with surprising na√Øvet√©, running up to the table, and\r\ninstantly staring at the corner of the letter, which peeped out from\r\nbeneath the paper-weight.\r\n\r\n\"And no doubt you had time to see how I hid the letter I had just\r\nreceived, under the paper-weight,\" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch calmly,\r\nwithout moving from his place.","\"A letter? Bless you and your letters, what are they to do with me?\"\r\ncried the visitor. \"But... what does matter...\" he whispered again,\r\nturning to the door, which was by now closed, and nodding his head in\r\nthat direction.\r\n\r\n\"She never listens,\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch observed coldly.\r\n\r\n\"What if she did overhear?\" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch, raising his voice\r\ncheerfully, and settling down in an arm-chair.","\"I've nothing against\r\nthat, only I've come here now to speak to you alone. Well, at last I've\r\nsucceeded in getting at you. First of all, how are you? I see you're\r\ngetting on splendidly. To-morrow you'll show yourself again--eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Set their minds at rest. Set mine at rest at last.\" He gesticulated\r\nviolently with a jocose and amiable air. \"If only you knew what nonsense\r\nI've had to talk to them.","You know, though.\" He laughed.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know everything. I only heard from my mother that you've\r\nbeen... very active.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, I've said nothing definite,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch flared up\r\nat once, as though defending himself from an awful attack. \"I simply\r\ntrotted out Shatov's wife; you know, that is, the rumours of your\r\nliaison in Paris, which accounted, of course, for what happened on\r\nSunday.","You're not angry?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure you've done your best.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's just what I was afraid of. Though what does that mean, 'done\r\nyour best'? That's a reproach, isn't it? You always go straight for\r\nthings, though.... What I was most afraid of, as I came here, was that\r\nyou wouldn't go straight for the point.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to go straight for anything,\" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch\r\nwith some irritation.","But he laughed at once.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mean that, I didn't mean that, don't make a mistake,\" cried\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch, waving his hands, rattling his words out like peas,\r\nand at once relieved at his companion's irritability. \"I'm not going to\r\nworry you with _our_ business, especially in your present position. I've\r\nonly come about Sunday's affair, and only to arrange the most necessary\r\nsteps, because, you see, it's impossible.","I've come with the frankest\r\nexplanations which I stand in more need of than you--so much for your\r\nvanity, but at the same time it's true. I've come to be open with you\r\nfrom this time forward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you have not been open with me before?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know that yourself. I've been cunning with you many times... you\r\nsmile; I'm very glad of that smile as a prelude to our explanation. I\r\nprovoked that smile on purpose by using the word 'cunning,' so that you\r\nmight get cross directly at my daring to think I could be cunning, so\r\nthat I might have a chance of explaining myself at once.","You see, you\r\nsee how open I have become now! Well, do you care to listen?\"\r\n\r\nIn the expression of Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch's face, which was\r\ncontemptuously composed, and even ironical, in spite of his visitor's\r\nobvious desire to irritate him by the insolence of his premeditated\r\nand intentionally coarse na√Øvet√©s, there was, at last, a look of rather\r\nuneasy curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, wriggling more than ever, \"when I set\r\noff to come here, I mean here in the large sense, to this town, ten days\r\nago, I made up my mind, of course, to assume a character.","It would\r\nhave been best to have done without anything, to have kept one's\r\nown character, wouldn't it? There is no better dodge than one's own\r\ncharacter, because no one believes in it. I meant, I must own, to assume\r\nthe part of a fool, because it is easier to be a fool than to act\r\none's own character; but as a fool is after all something extreme,\r\nand anything extreme excites curiosity, I ended by sticking to my own\r\ncharacter.","And what is my own character? The golden mean: neither wise\r\nnor foolish, rather stupid, and dropped from the moon, as sensible\r\npeople say here, isn't that it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it is,\" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, with a faint smile.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you agree--I'm very glad; I knew beforehand that it was your own\r\nopinion.... You needn't trouble, I am not annoyed, and I didn't describe\r\nmyself in that way to get a flattering contradiction from you--no,\r\nyou're not stupid, you're clever.","... Ah! you're smiling again!... I've\r\nblundered once more. You would not have said 'you're clever,' granted;\r\nI'll let it pass anyway. _Passons,_ as papa says, and, in parenthesis,\r\ndon't be vexed with my verbosity. By the way, I always say a lot, that\r\nis, use a great many words and talk very fast, and I never speak well.\r\nAnd why do I use so many words, and why do I never speak well? Because\r\nI don't know how to speak.","People who can speak well, speak briefly. So\r\nthat I am stupid, am I not? But as this gift of stupidity is natural\r\nto me, why shouldn't I make skilful use of it? And I do make use of it.\r\nIt's true that as I came here, I did think, at first, of being silent.\r\nBut you know silence is a great talent, and therefore incongruous for\r\nme, and secondly silence would be risky, anyway. So I made up my mind\r\nfinally that it would be best to talk, but to talk stupidly--that is, to\r\ntalk and talk and talk--to be in a tremendous hurry to explain things,\r\nand in the end to get muddled in my own explanations, so that my\r\nlistener would walk away without hearing the end, with a shrug, or,\r\nbetter still, with a curse.","You succeed straight off in persuading them\r\nof your simplicity, in boring them and in being incomprehensible--three\r\nadvantages all at once! Do you suppose anybody will suspect you of\r\nmysterious designs after that? Why, every one of them would take it as\r\na personal affront if anyone were to say I had secret designs. And I\r\nsometimes amuse them too, and that's priceless. Why, they're ready to\r\nforgive me everything now, just because the clever fellow who used\r\nto publish manifestoes out there turns out to be stupider than\r\nthemselves--that's so, isn't it? From your smile I see you approve.","\"\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch was not smiling at all, however.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, he was listening with a frown and some impatience.\r\n\r\n\"Eh? What? I believe you said 'no matter.'\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch rattled on. (Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had said nothing\r\nat all.) \"Of course, of course. I assure you I'm not here to compromise\r\nyou by my company, by claiming you as my comrade. But do you know you're\r\nhorribly captious to-day; I ran in to you with a light and open heart,\r\nand you seem to be laying up every word I say against me.","I assure you\r\nI'm not going to begin about anything shocking to-day, I give you my\r\nword, and I agree beforehand to all your conditions.\"\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch was obstinately silent.\r\n\r\n\"Eh? What? Did you say something? I see, I see that I've made a blunder\r\nagain, it seems; you've not suggested conditions and you're not going\r\nto; I believe you, I believe you; well, you can set your mind at rest;\r\nI know, of course, that it's not worth while for me to suggest them, is\r\nit? I'll answer for you beforehand, and--just from stupidity, of course;\r\nstupidity again.","... You're laughing? Eh? What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch laughed at last. \"I just remembered\r\nthat I really did call you stupid, but you weren't there then, so they\r\nmust have repeated it.... I would ask you to make haste and come to the\r\npoint.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, but I am at the point! I am talking about Sunday,\" babbled Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch. \"Why, what was I on Sunday? What would you call it? Just\r\nfussy, mediocre stupidity, and in the stupidest way I took possession of\r\nthe conversation by force.","But they forgave me everything, first because\r\nI dropped from the moon, that seems to be settled here, now, by every\r\none; and, secondly, because I told them a pretty little story, and got\r\nyou all out of a scrape, didn't they, didn't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is, you told your story so as to leave them in doubt and suggest\r\nsome compact and collusion between us, when there was no collusion and\r\nI'd not asked you to do anything.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so, just so!\" Pyotr Stepanovitch caught him up, apparently\r\ndelighted. \"That's just what I did do, for I wanted you to see that I\r\nimplied it; I exerted myself chiefly for your sake, for I caught you and\r\nwanted to compromise you, above all I wanted to find out how far you're\r\nafraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be interesting to know why you are so open now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be angry, don't be angry, don't glare at me.","... You're not,\r\nthough. You wonder why I am so open? Why, just because it's all changed\r\nnow; of course, it's over, buried under the sand. I've suddenly changed\r\nmy ideas about you. The old way is closed; now I shall never compromise\r\nyou in the old way, it will be in a new way now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've changed your tactics?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are no tactics. Now it's for you to decide in everything, that\r\nis, if you want to, say yes, and if you want to, say no.","There you have\r\nmy new tactics. And I won't say a word about our cause till you bid me\r\nyourself. You laugh? Laugh away. I'm laughing myself. But I'm in earnest\r\nnow, in earnest, in earnest, though a man who is in such a hurry is\r\nstupid, isn't he? Never mind, I may be stupid, but I'm in earnest, in\r\nearnest.\"\r\n\r\nHe really was speaking in earnest in quite a different tone, and with a\r\npeculiar excitement, so that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch looked at him with\r\ncuriosity.","\"You say you've changed your ideas about me?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I changed my ideas about you at the moment when you drew your hands\r\nback after Shatov's attack, and, that's enough, that's enough, no\r\nquestions, please, I'll say nothing more now.\"\r\n\r\nHe jumped up, waving his hands as though waving off questions. But as\r\nthere were no questions, and he had no reason to go away, he sank into\r\nan arm-chair again, somewhat reassured.","\"By the way, in parenthesis,\" he rattled on at once, \"some people here\r\nare babbling that you'll kill him, and taking bets about it, so that\r\nLembke positively thought of setting the police on, but Yulia Mihailovna\r\nforbade it.... But enough about that, quite enough, I only spoke of it\r\nto let you know. By the way, I moved the Lebyadkins the same day, you\r\nknow; did you get my note with their address?\"\r\n\r\n\"I received it at the time.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't do that by way of 'stupidity.' I did it genuinely, to serve\r\nyou. If it was stupid, anyway, it was done in good faith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, all right, perhaps it was necessary....\" said Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch dreamily, \"only don't write any more letters to me, I\r\nbeg you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible to avoid it. It was only one.\"\r\n\r\n\"So Liputin knows?\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible to help it: but Liputin, you know yourself, dare not.",".. By\r\nthe way, you ought to meet our fellows, that is, _the_ fellows not _our_\r\nfellows, or you'll be finding fault again. Don't disturb yourself,\r\nnot just now, but sometime. Just now it's raining. I'll let them know,\r\nthey'll meet together, and we'll go in the evening. They're waiting,\r\nwith their mouths open like young crows in a nest, to see what present\r\nwe've brought them. They're a hot-headed lot.","They've brought out\r\nleaflets, they're on the point of quarrelling. Virginsky is a universal\r\nhumanity man, Liputin is a Fourierist with a marked inclination for\r\npolice work; a man, I assure you, who is precious from one point of\r\nview, though he requires strict supervision in all others; and, last of\r\nall, that fellow with the long ears, he'll read an account of his own\r\nsystem. And do you know, they're offended at my treating them casually,\r\nand throwing cold water over them, but we certainly must meet.","\"\r\n\r\n\"You've made me out some sort of chief?\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch dropped\r\nas carelessly as possible.\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch looked quickly at him.\r\n\r\n\"By the way,\" he interposed, in haste to change the subject, as though\r\nhe had not heard. \"I've been here two or three times, you know, to see\r\nher excellency, Varvara Petrovna, and I have been obliged to say a great\r\ndeal too.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, don't imagine, I've simply told her that you won't kill him, well,\r\nand other sweet things.","And only fancy; the very next day she knew I'd\r\nmoved Marya Timofyevna beyond the river. Was it you told her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never dreamed of it!\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew it wasn't you. Who else could it be? It's interesting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Liputin, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"N-no, not Liputin,\" muttered Pyotr Stepanovitch, frowning; \"I'll find\r\nout who. It's more like Shatov.... That's nonsense though. Let's leave\r\nthat! Though it's awfully important.","... By the way, I kept expecting\r\nthat your mother would suddenly burst out with the great question....\r\nAch! yes, she was horribly glum at first, but suddenly, when I came\r\nto-day, she was beaming all over, what does that mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's because I promised her to-day that within five days I'll be\r\nengaged to Lizaveta Nikolaevna,\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch said with\r\nsurprising openness.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!... Yes, of course,\" faltered Pyotr Stepanovitch, seeming\r\ndisconcerted.","\"There are rumours of her engagement, you know. It's true,\r\ntoo. But you're right, she'd run from under the wedding crown, you've\r\nonly to call to her. You're not angry at my saying so?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not angry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I notice it's awfully hard to make you angry to-day, and I begin to be\r\nafraid of you. I'm awfully curious to know how you'll appear to-morrow.\r\nI expect you've got a lot of things ready.","You're not angry at my saying\r\nso?\"\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch made no answer at all, which completed Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch's irritation.\r\n\r\n\"By the way, did you say that in earnest to your mother, about Lizaveta\r\nNikolaevna?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch looked coldly at him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I understand, it was only to soothe her, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if it were in earnest?\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch asked firmly.","\"Oh, God bless you then, as they say in such cases. It won't hinder the\r\ncause (you see, I don't say 'our,' you don't like the word 'our') and I\r\n... well, I ... am at your service, as you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think nothing--nothing,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch hurriedly declared,\r\nlaughing, \"because I know you consider what you're about beforehand for\r\nyourself, and everything with you has been thought out.","I only mean that\r\nI am seriously at your service, always and everywhere, and in every sort\r\nof circumstance, every sort really, do you understand that?\"\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch yawned.\r\n\r\n\"I've bored you,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch cried, jumping up suddenly, and\r\nsnatching his perfectly new round hat as though he were going away. He\r\nremained and went on talking, however, though he stood up, sometimes\r\npacing about the room and tapping himself on the knee with his hat at\r\nexciting parts of the conversation.","\"I meant to amuse you with stories of the Lembkes, too,\" he cried gaily.\r\n\r\n\"Afterwards, perhaps, not now. But how is Yulia Mihailovna?\"\r\n\r\n\"What conventional manners all of you have! Her health is no more to\r\nyou than the health of the grey cat, yet you ask after it. I approve\r\nof that. She's quite well, and her respect for you amounts to a\r\nsuperstition, her immense anticipations of you amount to a superstition.","She does not say a word about what happened on Sunday, and is convinced\r\nthat you will overcome everything yourself by merely making your\r\nappearance. Upon my word! She fancies you can do anything. You're an\r\nenigmatic and romantic figure now, more than ever you were--extremely\r\nadvantageous position. It is incredible how eager every one is to see\r\nyou. They were pretty hot when I went away, but now it is more so than\r\never.","Thanks again for your letter. They are all afraid of Count K. Do\r\nyou know they look upon you as a spy? I keep that up, you're not angry?\"\r\n\r\n\"It does not matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does not matter; it's essential in the long run. They have their\r\nways of doing things here. I encourage it, of course; Yulia Mihailovna,\r\nin the first place, Gaganov too.... You laugh? But you know I have my\r\npolicy; I babble away and suddenly I say something clever just as they\r\nare on the look-out for it.","They crowd round me and I humbug away again.\r\nThey've all given me up in despair by now: 'he's got brains but he's\r\ndropped from the moon.' Lembke invites me to enter the service so that\r\nI may be reformed. You know I treat him mockingly, that is, I compromise\r\nhim and he simply stares. Yulia Mihailovna encourages it. Oh, by the\r\nway, Gaganov is in an awful rage with you. He said the nastiest things\r\nabout you yesterday at Duhovo.","I told him the whole truth on the spot,\r\nthat is, of course, not the whole truth. I spent the whole day at\r\nDuhovo. It's a splendid estate, a fine house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then is he at Duhovo now?\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch broke in suddenly,\r\nmaking a sudden start forward and almost leaping up from his seat.\r\n\r\n\"No, he drove me here this morning, we returned together,\" said Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch, appearing not to notice Stavrogin's momentary excitement.","\"What's this? I dropped a book.\" He bent down to pick up the \"keepsake\"\r\nhe had knocked down. \"'The Women of Balzac,' with illustrations.\" He\r\nopened it suddenly. \"I haven't read it. Lembke writes novels too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" queried Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, as though beginning to be\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\n\"In Russian, on the sly, of course, Yulia Mihailovna knows and allows\r\nit. He's henpecked, but with good manners; it's their system.","Such\r\nstrict form--such self-restraint! Something of the sort would be the\r\nthing for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"You approve of government methods?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should rather think so! It's the one thing that's natural and\r\npracticable in Russia.... I won't... I won't,\" he cried out suddenly,\r\n\"I'm not referring to that--not a word on delicate subjects. Good-bye,\r\nthough, you look rather green.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm feverish.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can well believe it; you should go to bed.","By the way, there are\r\nSkoptsi here in the neighbourhood--they're curious people... of that\r\nlater, though. Ah, here's another anecdote. There's an infantry regiment\r\nhere in the district. I was drinking last Friday evening with the\r\nofficers. We've three friends among them, _vous comprenez?_ They were\r\ndiscussing atheism and I need hardly say they made short work of God.\r\nThey were squealing with delight.","By the way, Shatov declares that if\r\nthere's to be a rising in Russia we must begin with atheism. Maybe it's\r\ntrue. One grizzled old stager of a captain sat mum, not saying a word.\r\nAll at once he stands up in the middle of the room and says aloud, as\r\nthough speaking to himself: 'If there's no God, how can I be a captain\r\nthen?' He took up his cap and went out, flinging up his hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"He expressed a rather sensible idea,\" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch,\r\nyawning for the third time.","\"Yes? I didn't understand it; I meant to ask you about it. Well what\r\nelse have I to tell you? The Shpigulin factory's interesting; as you\r\nknow, there are five hundred workmen in it, it's a hotbed of cholera,\r\nit's not been cleaned for fifteen years and the factory hands are\r\nswindled. The owners are millionaires. I assure you that some among\r\nthe hands have an idea of the _Internationale._ What, you smile? You'll\r\nsee--only give me ever so little time! I've asked you to fix the time\r\nalready and now I ask you again and then.","... But I beg your pardon,\r\nI won't, I won't speak of that, don't frown. There!\" He turned back\r\nsuddenly. \"I quite forgot the chief thing. I was told just now that our\r\nbox had come from Petersburg.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean...\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch looked at him, not understanding.\r\n\r\n\"Your box, your things, coats, trousers, and linen have come. Is it\r\ntrue?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes... they said something about it this morning.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Ach, then can't I open it at once!...\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask Alexey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, to-morrow, then, will to-morrow do? You see my new jacket,\r\ndress-coat and three pairs of trousers are with your things, from\r\nSharmer's, by your recommendation, do you remember?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hear you're going in for being a gentleman here,\" said Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch with a smile. \"Is it true you're going to take lessons\r\nat the riding school?\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch smiled a wry smile.","\"I say,\" he said suddenly, with\r\nexcessive haste in a voice that quivered and faltered, \"I say, Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch, let's drop personalities once for all. Of course, you\r\ncan despise me as much as you like if it amuses you--but we'd better\r\ndispense with personalities for a time, hadn't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch assented.\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch grinned, tapped his knee with his hat, shifted from\r\none leg to the other, and recovered his former expression.","\"Some people here positively look upon me as your rival with Lizaveta\r\nNikolaevna, so I must think of my appearance, mustn't I,\" he laughed.\r\n\"Who was it told you that though? H'm. It's just eight o'clock; well I\r\nmust be off. I promised to look in on Varvara Petrovna, but I shall\r\nmake my escape. And you go to bed and you'll be stronger to-morrow. It's\r\nraining and dark, but I've a cab, it's not over safe in the streets here\r\nat night.","... Ach, by the way, there's a run-away convict from Siberia,\r\nFedka, wandering about the town and the neighbourhood. Only fancy, he\r\nused to be a serf of mine, and my papa sent him for a soldier fifteen\r\nyears ago and took the money for him. He's a very remarkable person.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been talking to him?\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch scanned him.\r\n\r\n\"I have. He lets me know where he is. He's ready for anything, anything,\r\nfor money of course, but he has convictions, too, of a sort, of course.","Oh yes, by the way, again, if you meant anything of that plan, you\r\nremember, about Lizaveta Nikolaevna, I tell you once again, I too am a\r\nfellow ready for anything of any kind you like, and absolutely at\r\nyour service.... Hullo! are you reaching for your stick. Oh no... only\r\nfancy... I thought you were looking for your stick.\"\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch was looking for nothing and said nothing.","But he had risen to his feet very suddenly with a strange look in his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"If you want any help about Mr. Gaganov either,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\nblurted out suddenly, this time looking straight at the paper-weight,\r\n\"of course I can arrange it all, and I'm certain you won't be able to\r\nmanage without me.\"\r\n\r\nHe went out suddenly without waiting for an answer, but thrust his\r\nhead in at the door once more.","\"I mention that,\" he gabbled hurriedly,\r\n\"because Shatov had no right either, you know, to risk his life last\r\nSunday when he attacked you, had he? I should be glad if you would make\r\na note of that.\" He disappeared again without waiting for an answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nPerhaps he imagined, as he made his exit, that as soon as he was left\r\nalone, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch would begin beating on the wall with his\r\nfists, and no doubt he would have been glad to see this, if that\r\nhad been possible.","But, if so, he was greatly mistaken. Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch was still calm. He remained standing for two minutes in\r\nthe same position by the table, apparently plunged in thought, but soon\r\na cold and listless smile came on to his lips. He slowly sat down again\r\nin the same place in the corner of the sofa, and shut his eyes as though\r\nfrom weariness. The corner of the letter was still peeping from under\r\nthe paperweight, but he didn't even move to cover it.","He soon sank into complete forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nWhen Pyotr Stepanovitch went out without coming to see her, as he had\r\npromised, Varvara Petrovna, who had been worn out by anxiety during\r\nthese days, could not control herself, and ventured to visit her son\r\nherself, though it was not her regular time. She was still haunted by\r\nthe idea that he would tell her something conclusive. She knocked at\r\nthe door gently as before, and again receiving no answer, she opened\r\nthe door.","Seeing that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was sitting strangely\r\nmotionless, she cautiously advanced to the sofa with a throbbing heart.\r\nShe seemed struck by the fact that he could fall asleep so quickly and\r\nthat he could sleep sitting like that, so erect and motionless, so\r\nthat his breathing even was scarcely perceptible. His face was pale and\r\nforbidding, but it looked, as it were, numb and rigid. His brows were\r\nsomewhat contracted and frowning.","He positively had the look of a\r\nlifeless wax figure. She stood over him for about three minutes,\r\nalmost holding her breath, and suddenly she was seized with terror. She\r\nwithdrew on tiptoe, stopped at the door, hurriedly made the sign of the\r\ncross over him, and retreated unobserved, with a new oppression and a\r\nnew anguish at her heart.\r\n\r\nHe slept a long while, more than an hour, and still in the same rigid\r\npose: not a muscle of his face twitched, there was not the faintest\r\nmovement in his whole body, and his brows were still contracted in the\r\nsame forbidding frown.","If Varvara Petrovna had remained another three\r\nminutes she could not have endured the stifling sensation that this\r\nmotionless lethargy roused in her, and would have waked him. But he\r\nsuddenly opened his eyes, and sat for ten minutes as immovable as\r\nbefore, staring persistently and curiously, as though at some object\r\nin the corner which had struck him, although there was nothing new or\r\nstriking in the room.","Suddenly there rang out the low deep note of the clock on the wall.\r\n\r\nWith some uneasiness he turned to look at it, but almost at the same\r\nmoment the other door opened, and the butler, Alexey Yegorytch came in.\r\nHe had in one hand a greatcoat, a scarf, and a hat, and in the other a\r\nsilver tray with a note on it.\r\n\r\n\"Half-past nine,\" he announced softly, and laying the other things on a\r\nchair, he held out the tray with the note--a scrap of paper unsealed and\r\nscribbled in pencil.","Glancing through it, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch took\r\na pencil from the table, added a few words, and put the note back on the\r\ntray.\r\n\r\n\"Take it back as soon as I have gone out, and now dress me,\" he said,\r\ngetting up from the sofa.\r\n\r\nNoticing that he had on a light velvet jacket, he thought a minute,\r\nand told the man to bring him a cloth coat, which he wore on more\r\nceremonious occasions. At last, when he was dressed and had put on his\r\nhat, he locked the door by which his mother had come into the room, took\r\nthe letter from under the paperweight, and without saying a word went\r\nout into the corridor, followed by Alexey Yegorytch.","From the corridor\r\nthey went down the narrow stone steps of the back stairs to a passage\r\nwhich opened straight into the garden. In the corner stood a lantern and\r\na big umbrella.\r\n\r\n\"Owing to the excessive rain the mud in the streets is beyond anything,\"\r\nAlexey Yegorytch announced, making a final effort to deter his master\r\nfrom the expedition. But opening his umbrella the latter went without\r\na word into the damp and sodden garden, which was dark as a cellar.","The\r\nwind was roaring and tossing the bare tree-tops. The little sandy\r\npaths were wet and slippery. Alexey Yegorytch walked along as he was,\r\nbareheaded, in his swallow-tail coat, lighting up the path for about\r\nthree steps before them with the lantern.\r\n\r\n\"Won't it be noticed?\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Not from the windows. Besides I have seen to all that already,\" the old\r\nservant answered in quiet and measured tones.","\"Has my mother retired?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her excellency locked herself in at nine o'clock as she has done the\r\nlast few days, and there is no possibility of her knowing anything. At\r\nwhat hour am I to expect your honour?\"\r\n\r\n\"At one or half-past, not later than two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nCrossing the garden by the winding paths that they both knew by heart,\r\nthey reached the stone wall, and there in the farthest corner found\r\na little door, which led out into a narrow and deserted lane, and was\r\nalways kept locked.","It appeared that Alexey Yegorytch had the key in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"Won't the door creak?\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch inquired again.\r\n\r\nBut Alexey Yegorytch informed him that it had been oiled yesterday \"as\r\nwell as to-day.\" He was by now wet through. Unlocking the door he gave\r\nthe key to Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch.\r\n\r\n\"If it should be your pleasure to be taking a distant walk, I would warn\r\nyour honour that I am not confident of the folk here, especially in\r\nthe back lanes, and especially beyond the river,\" he could not resist\r\nwarning him again.","He was an old servant, who had been like a nurse to\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch, and at one time used to dandle him in his arms;\r\nhe was a grave and severe man who was fond of listening to religious\r\ndiscourse and reading books of devotion.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be uneasy, Alexey Yegorytch.\"\r\n\r\n\"May God's blessing rest on you, sir, but only in your righteous\r\nundertakings.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, stopping short in the lane.","Alexey Yegorytch resolutely repeated his words. He had never before\r\nventured to express himself in such language in his master's presence.\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch locked the door, put the key in his pocket, and\r\ncrossed the lane, sinking five or six inches into the mud at every step.\r\nHe came out at last into a long deserted street. He knew the town like\r\nthe five fingers of his hand, but Bogoyavlensky Street was a long way\r\noff.","It was past ten when he stopped at last before the locked gates of\r\nthe dark old house that belonged to Filipov. The ground floor had stood\r\nempty since the Lebyadkins had left it, and the windows were boarded up,\r\nbut there was a light burning in Shatov's room on the second floor. As\r\nthere was no bell he began banging on the gate with his hand. A window\r\nwas opened and Shatov peeped out into the street.","It was terribly dark,\r\nand difficult to make out anything. Shatov was peering out for some\r\ntime, about a minute.\r\n\r\n\"Is that you?\" he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the uninvited guest.\r\n\r\nShatov slammed the window, went downstairs and opened the gate. Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch stepped over the high sill, and without a word passed by\r\nhim straight into Kirillov's lodge.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThere everything was unlocked and all the doors stood open.","The passage\r\nand the first two rooms were dark, but there was a light shining in the\r\nlast, in which Kirillov lived and drank tea, and laughter and strange\r\ncries came from it. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch went towards the light, but\r\nstood still in the doorway without going in. There was tea on the table.\r\nIn the middle of the room stood the old woman who was a relation of the\r\nlandlord. She was bareheaded and was dressed in a petticoat and a\r\nhare-skin jacket, and her stockingless feet were thrust into slippers.","In her arms she had an eighteen-months-old baby, with nothing on but its\r\nlittle shirt; with bare legs, flushed cheeks, and ruffled white hair. It\r\nhad only just been taken out of the cradle. It seemed to have just been\r\ncrying; there were still tears in its eyes. But at that instant it was\r\nstretching out its little arms, clapping its hands, and laughing with a\r\nsob as little children do. Kirillov was bouncing a big red india-rubber\r\nball on the floor before it.","The ball bounced up to the ceiling, and back\r\nto the floor, the baby shrieked \"Baw! baw!\" Kirillov caught the \"baw\",\r\nand gave it to it. The baby threw it itself with its awkward little hands,\r\nand Kirillov ran to pick it up again.\r\n\r\nAt last the \"baw\" rolled under the cupboard. \"Baw! baw!\" cried the\r\nchild. Kirillov lay down on the floor, trying to reach the ball with his\r\nhand under the cupboard.","Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch went into the room. The\r\nbaby caught sight of him, nestled against the old woman, and went off\r\ninto a prolonged infantile wail. The woman immediately carried it out of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\"Stavrogin?\" said Kirillov, beginning to get up from the floor with the\r\nball in his hand, and showing no surprise at the unexpected visit. \"Will\r\nyou have tea?\"\r\n\r\nHe rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"I should be very glad of it, if it's hot,\" said Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch; \"I'm wet through.","\"\r\n\r\n\"It's hot, nearly boiling in fact,\" Kirillov declared delighted. \"Sit\r\ndown. You're muddy, but that's nothing; I'll mop up the floor later.\"\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch sat down and emptied the cup he handed him\r\nalmost at a gulp.\r\n\r\n\"Some more?\" asked Kirillov.\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you.\"\r\n\r\nKirillov, who had not sat down till then, seated himself facing him, and\r\ninquired:\r\n\r\n\"Why have you come?\"\r\n\r\n\"On business.","Here, read this letter from Gaganov; do you remember, I\r\ntalked to you about him in Petersburg.\"\r\n\r\nKirillov took the letter, read it, laid it on the table and looked at\r\nhim expectantly.\r\n\r\n\"As you know, I met this Gaganov for the first time in my life a month\r\nago, in Petersburg,\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch began to explain. \"We\r\ncame across each other two or three times in company with other people.","Without making my acquaintance and without addressing me, he managed to\r\nbe very insolent to me. I told you so at the time; but now for something\r\nyou don't know. As he was leaving Petersburg before I did, he sent me\r\na letter, not like this one, yet impertinent in the highest degree, and\r\nwhat was queer about it was that it contained no sort of explanation of\r\nwhy it was written. I answered him at once, also by letter, and said,\r\nquite frankly, that he was probably angry with me on account of the\r\nincident with his father four years ago in the club here, and that I for\r\nmy part was prepared to make him every possible apology, seeing that my\r\naction was unintentional and was the result of illness.","I begged him to\r\nconsider and accept my apologies. He went away without answering, and\r\nnow here I find him in a regular fury. Several things he has said about\r\nme in public have been repeated to me, absolutely abusive, and making\r\nastounding charges against me. Finally, to-day, I get this letter, a\r\nletter such as no one has ever had before, I should think, containing\r\nsuch expressions as 'the punch you got in your ugly face.","' I came in the\r\nhope that you would not refuse to be my second.\"\r\n\r\n\"You said no one has ever had such a letter,\" observed Kirillov, \"they\r\nmay be sent in a rage. Such letters have been written more than once.\r\nPushkin wrote to Hekern. All right, I'll come. Tell me how.\"\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch explained that he wanted it to be to-morrow, and\r\nthat he must begin by renewing his offers of apology, and even with the\r\npromise of another letter of apology, but on condition that Gaganov,\r\non his side, should promise to send no more letters.","The letter he had\r\nreceived he would regard as unwritten.\r\n\r\n\"Too much concession; he won't agree,\" said Kirillov.\r\n\r\n\"I've come first of all to find out whether you would consent to be the\r\nbearer of such terms.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll take them. It's your affair. But he won't agree.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know he won't agree.\"\r\n\r\n\"He wants to fight. Say how you'll fight.\"\r\n\r\n\"The point is that I want the thing settled to-morrow.","By nine o'clock\r\nin the morning you must be at his house. He'll listen, and won't agree,\r\nbut will put you in communication with his second--let us say about\r\neleven. You will arrange things with him, and let us all be on the\r\nspot by one or two o'clock. Please try to arrange that. The weapons, of\r\ncourse, will be pistols. And I particularly beg you to arrange to fix\r\nthe barriers at ten paces apart; then you put each of us ten paces from\r\nthe barrier, and at a given signal we approach.","Each must go right up to\r\nhis barrier, but you may fire before, on the way. I believe that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten paces between the barriers is very near,\" observed Kirillov.\r\n\r\n\"Well, twelve then, but not more. You understand that he wants to fight\r\nin earnest. Do you know how to load a pistol?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do. I've got pistols. I'll give my word that you've never fired\r\nthem. His second will give his word about his.","There'll be two pairs of\r\npistols, and we'll toss up, his or ours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you like to look at the pistols?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well.\"\r\n\r\nKirillov squatted on his heels before the trunk in the corner, which\r\nhe had never yet unpacked, though things had been pulled out of it as\r\nrequired. He pulled out from the bottom a palm-wood box lined with red\r\nvelvet, and from it took out a pair of smart and very expensive pistols.","\"I've got everything, powder, bullets, cartridges. I've a revolver\r\nbesides, wait.\"\r\n\r\nHe stooped down to the trunk again and took out a six-chambered American\r\nrevolver.\r\n\r\n\"You've got weapons enough, and very good ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very, extremely.\"\r\n\r\nKirillov, who was poor, almost destitute, though he never noticed his\r\npoverty, was evidently proud of showing precious weapons, which he had\r\ncertainly obtained with great sacrifice.","\"You still have the same intentions?\" Stavrogin asked after a moment's\r\nsilence, and with a certain wariness.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Kirillov shortly, guessing at once from his voice what\r\nhe was asking about, and he began taking the weapons from the table.\r\n\r\n\"When?\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch inquired still more cautiously, after a\r\npause.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Kirillov had put both the boxes back in his trunk, and\r\nsat down in his place again.","\"That doesn't depend on me, as you know--when they tell me,\" he\r\nmuttered, as though disliking the question; but at the same time with\r\nevident readiness to answer any other question. He kept his black,\r\nlustreless eyes fixed continually on Stavrogin with a calm but warm and\r\nkindly expression in them.\r\n\r\n\"I understand shooting oneself, of course,\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch\r\nbegan suddenly, frowning a little, after a dreamy silence that lasted\r\nthree minutes.","\"I sometimes have thought of it myself, and then there\r\nalways came a new idea: if one did something wicked, or, worse still,\r\nsomething shameful, that is, disgraceful, only very shameful and...\r\nridiculous, such as people would remember for a thousand years and hold\r\nin scorn for a thousand years, and suddenly the thought comes: 'one blow\r\nin the temple and there would be nothing more.' One wouldn't care then\r\nfor men and that they would hold one in scorn for a thousand years,\r\nwould one?\"\r\n\r\n\"You call that a new idea?\" said Kirillov, after a moment's thought.","\"I... didn't call it so, but when I thought it I felt it as a new idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"You 'felt the idea'?\" observed Kirillov. \"That's good. There are lots\r\nof ideas that are always there and yet suddenly become new. That's true.\r\nI see a great deal now as though it were for the first time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you had lived in the moon,\" Stavrogin interrupted, not\r\nlistening, but pursuing his own thought, \"and suppose there you had done\r\nall these nasty and ridiculous things.","... You know from here for certain\r\nthat they will laugh at you and hold you in scorn for a thousand years\r\nas long as the moon lasts. But now you are here, and looking at the moon\r\nfrom here. You don't care here for anything you've done there, and that\r\nthe people there will hold you in scorn for a thousand years, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" answered Kirillov. \"I've not been in the moon,\" he\r\nadded, without any irony, simply to state the fact.","\"Whose baby was that just now?\"\r\n\r\n\"The old woman's mother-in-law was here--no, daughter-in-law, it's all\r\nthe same. Three days. She's lying ill with the baby, it cries a lot at\r\nnight, it's the stomach. The mother sleeps, but the old woman picks it\r\nup; I play ball with it. The ball's from Hamburg. I bought it in Hamburg\r\nto throw it and catch it, it strengthens the spine. It's a girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you fond of children?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" answered Kirillov, though rather indifferently.","\"Then you're fond of life?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm fond of life! What of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Though you've made up your mind to shoot yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of it? Why connect it? Life's one thing and that's another. Life\r\nexists, but death doesn't at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've begun to believe in a future eternal life?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not in a future eternal life, but in eternal life here. There are\r\nmoments, you reach moments, and time suddenly stands still, and it will\r\nbecome eternal.","\"\r\n\r\n\"You hope to reach such a moment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That'll scarcely be possible in our time,\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch\r\nresponded slowly and, as it were, dreamily; the two spoke without the\r\nslightest irony. \"In the Apocalypse the angel swears that there will be\r\nno more time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. That's very true; distinct and exact. When all mankind attains\r\nhappiness then there will be no more time, for there'll be no need of\r\nit, a very true thought.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Where will they put it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nowhere. Time's not an object but an idea. It will be extinguished in\r\nthe mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"The old commonplaces of philosophy, the same from the beginning of\r\ntime,\" Stavrogin muttered with a kind of disdainful compassion.\r\n\r\n\"Always the same, always the same, from the beginning of time and never\r\nany other,\" Kirillov said with sparkling eyes, as though there were\r\nalmost a triumph in that idea.","\"You seem to be very happy, Kirillov.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, very happy,\" he answered, as though making the most ordinary\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n\"But you were distressed so lately, angry with Liputin.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm... I'm not scolding now. I didn't know then that I was happy. Have\r\nyou seen a leaf, a leaf from a tree?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw a yellow one lately, a little green. It was decayed at the edges.\r\nIt was blown by the wind.","When I was ten years old I used to shut my\r\neyes in the winter on purpose and fancy a green leaf, bright, with veins\r\non it, and the sun shining. I used to open my eyes and not believe them,\r\nbecause it was very nice, and I used to shut them again.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that? An allegory?\"\r\n\r\n\"N-no... why? I'm not speaking of an allegory, but of a leaf, only a\r\nleaf. The leaf is good. Everything's good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything.","Man is unhappy because he doesn't know he's happy. It's\r\nonly that. That's all, that's all! If anyone finds out he'll become\r\nhappy at once, that minute. That mother-in-law will die; but the baby\r\nwill remain. It's all good. I discovered it all of a sudden.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if anyone dies of hunger, and if anyone insults and outrages the\r\nlittle girl, is that good?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! And if anyone blows his brains out for the baby, that's good too.","And if anyone doesn't, that's good too. It's all good, all. It's good\r\nfor all those who know that it's all good. If they knew that it was good\r\nfor them, it would be good for them, but as long as they don't know it's\r\ngood for them, it will be bad for them. That's the whole idea, the whole\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you find out you were so happy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Last week, on Tuesday, no, Wednesday, for it was Wednesday by that\r\ntime, in the night.","\"\r\n\r\n\"By what reasoning?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember; I was walking about the room; never mind. I stopped\r\nmy clock. It was thirty-seven minutes past two.\"\r\n\r\n\"As an emblem of the fact that there will be no more time?\"\r\n\r\nKirillov was silent.\r\n\r\n\"They're bad because they don't know they're good. When they find out,\r\nthey won't outrage a little girl. They'll find out that they're good and\r\nthey'll all become good, every one of them.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Here you've found it out, so have you become good then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am good.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I agree with, though,\" Stavrogin muttered, frowning.\r\n\r\n\"He who teaches that all are good will end the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"He who taught it was crucified.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will come, and his name will be the man-god.\"\r\n\r\n\"The god-man?\"\r\n\r\n\"The man-god. That's the difference.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely it wasn't you lighted the lamp under the ikon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was I lighted it.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you do it believing?\"\r\n\r\n\"The old woman likes to have the lamp and she hadn't time to do it\r\nto-day,\" muttered Kirillov.\r\n\r\n\"You don't say prayers yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"I pray to everything. You see the spider crawling on the wall, I look\r\nat it and thank it for crawling.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes glowed again. He kept looking straight at Stavrogin with\r\nfirm and unflinching expression. Stavrogin frowned and watched him\r\ndisdainfully, but there was no mockery in his eyes.","\"I'll bet that when I come next time you'll be believing in God too,\"\r\nhe said, getting up and taking his hat.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" said Kirillov, getting up too.\r\n\r\n\"If you were to find out that you believe in God, then you'd believe in\r\nHim; but since you don't know that you believe in Him, then you don't\r\nbelieve in Him,\" laughed Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch.\r\n\r\n\"That's not right,\" Kirillov pondered, \"you've distorted the idea.","It's\r\na flippant joke. Remember what you have meant in my life, Stavrogin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Kirillov.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come at night; when will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, haven't you forgotten about to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ach, I'd forgotten. Don't be uneasy. I won't oversleep. At nine\r\no'clock. I know how to wake up when I want to. I go to bed saying 'seven\r\no'clock,' and I wake up at seven o'clock, 'ten o'clock,' and I wake up\r\nat ten o'clock.","\"\r\n\r\n\"You have remarkable powers,\" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, looking at\r\nhis pale face.\r\n\r\n\"I'll come and open the gate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't trouble, Shatov will open it for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Shatov. Very well, good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThe door of the empty house in which Shatov was lodging was not closed;\r\nbut, making his way into the passage, Stavrogin found himself in utter\r\ndarkness, and began feeling with his hand for the stairs to the upper\r\nstory.","Suddenly a door opened upstairs and a light appeared. Shatov\r\ndid not come out himself, but simply opened his door. When Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch was standing in the doorway of the room, he saw Shatov\r\nstanding at the table in the corner, waiting expectantly.\r\n\r\n\"Will you receive me on business?\" he queried from the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"Come in and sit down,\" answered Shatov. \"Shut the door; stay, I'll shut\r\nit.","\"\r\n\r\nHe locked the door, returned to the table, and sat down, facing Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch. He had grown thinner during that week, and now he\r\nseemed in a fever.\r\n\r\n\"You've been worrying me to death,\" he said, looking down, in a soft\r\nhalf-whisper. \"Why didn't you come?\"\r\n\r\n\"You were so sure I should come then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, stay, I have been delirious... perhaps I'm delirious now.... Stay\r\na moment.","\"\r\n\r\nHe got up and seized something that was lying on the uppermost of his\r\nthree bookshelves. It was a revolver.\r\n\r\n\"One night, in delirium, I fancied that you were coming to kill me, and\r\nearly next morning I spent my last farthing on buying a revolver from\r\nthat good-for-nothing fellow Lyamshin; I did not mean to let you do it.\r\nThen I came to myself again... I've neither powder nor shot; it has been\r\nlying there on the shelf till now; wait a minute.","...\"\r\n\r\nHe got up and was opening the casement.\r\n\r\n\"Don't throw it away, why should you?\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch checked\r\nhim. \"It's worth something. Besides, tomorrow people will begin saying\r\nthat there are revolvers lying about under Shatov's window. Put it back,\r\nthat's right; sit down. Tell me, why do you seem to be penitent for\r\nhaving thought I should come to kill you? I have not come now to be\r\nreconciled, but to talk of something necessary.","Enlighten me to begin\r\nwith. You didn't give me that blow because of my connection with your\r\nwife?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know I didn't, yourself,\" said Shatov, looking down again.\r\n\r\n\"And not because you believed the stupid gossip about Darya Pavlovna?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, of course not! It's nonsense! My sister told me from the very\r\nfirst...\" Shatov said, harshly and impatiently, and even with a slight\r\nstamp of his foot.","\"Then I guessed right and you too guessed right,\" Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch went on in a tranquil voice. \"You are right. Marya\r\nTimofyevna Lebyadkin is my lawful wife, married to me four and a half\r\nyears ago in Petersburg. I suppose the blow was on her account?\"\r\n\r\nShatov, utterly astounded, listened in silence.\r\n\r\n\"I guessed, but did not believe it,\" he muttered at last, looking\r\nstrangely at Stavrogin.","\"And you struck me?\"\r\n\r\nShatov flushed and muttered almost incoherently:\r\n\r\n\"Because of your fall... your lie. I didn't go up to you to punish\r\nyou... I didn't know when I went up to you that I should strike you... I\r\ndid it because you meant so much to me in my life... I...\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand, I understand, spare your words. I am sorry you are\r\nfeverish. I've come about a most urgent matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been expecting you too long.","\" Shatov seemed to be quivering all\r\nover, and he got up from his seat. \"Say what you have to say... I'll\r\nspeak too... later.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down.\r\n\r\n\"What I have come about is nothing of that kind,\" began Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch, scrutinising him with curiosity. \"Owing to certain\r\ncircumstances I was forced this very day to choose such an hour to come\r\nand tell you that they may murder you.\"\r\n\r\nShatov looked wildly at him.","\"I know that I may be in some danger,\" he said in measured tones, \"but\r\nhow can you have come to know of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I belong to them as you do, and am a member of their society,\r\njust as you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"You... you are a member of the society?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see from your eyes that you were prepared for anything from me rather\r\nthan that,\" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, with a faint smile. \"But,\r\nexcuse me, you knew then that there would be an attempt on your life?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of the sort.","And I don't think so now, in spite of your words,\r\nthough... though there's no being sure of anything with these fools!\"\r\nhe cried suddenly in a fury, striking the table with his fist. \"I'm not\r\nafraid of them! I've broken with them. That fellow's run here four times\r\nto tell me it was possible... but\"--he looked at Stavrogin--\"what do\r\nyou know about it, exactly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be uneasy; I am not deceiving you,\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch went\r\non, rather coldly, with the air of a man who is only fulfilling a duty.","\"You question me as to what I know. I know that you entered that society\r\nabroad, two years ago, at the time of the old organisation, just before\r\nyou went to America, and I believe, just after our last conversation,\r\nabout which you wrote so much to me in your letter from America. By\r\nthe way, I must apologise for not having answered you by letter, but\r\nconfined myself to...\"\r\n\r\n\"To sending the money; wait a bit,\" Shatov interrupted, hurriedly\r\npulling out a drawer in the table and taking from under some papers a\r\nrainbow-coloured note.","\"Here, take it, the hundred roubles you sent me;\r\nbut for you I should have perished out there. I should have been a long\r\ntime paying it back if it had not been for your mother. She made me a\r\npresent of that note nine months ago, because I was so badly off after\r\nmy illness. But, go on, please....\"\r\n\r\nHe was breathless.\r\n\r\n\"In America you changed your views, and when you came back you wanted to\r\nresign.","They gave you no answer, but charged you to take over a printing\r\npress here in Russia from someone, and to keep it till you handed\r\nit over to someone who would come from them for it. I don't know\r\nthe details exactly, but I fancy that's the position in outline. You\r\nundertook it in the hope, or on the condition, that it would be the last\r\ntask they would require of you, and that then they would release you\r\naltogether.","Whether that is so or not, I learnt it, not from them, but\r\nquite by chance. But now for what I fancy you don't know; these gentry\r\nhave no intention of parting with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's absurd!\" cried Shatov. \"I've told them honestly that I've cut\r\nmyself off from them in everything. That is my right, the right to\r\nfreedom of conscience and of thought.... I won't put up with it! There's\r\nno power which could.","..\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, don't shout,\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch said earnestly, checking\r\nhim. \"That Verhovensky is such a fellow that he may be listening to us\r\nnow in your passage, perhaps, with his own ears or someone else's. Even\r\nthat drunkard, Lebyadkin, was probably bound to keep an eye on you,\r\nand you on him, too, I dare say? You'd better tell me, has Verhovensky\r\naccepted your arguments now, or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has.","He has said that it can be done and that I have the right....\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then, he's deceiving you. I know that even Kirillov, who scarcely\r\nbelongs to them at all, has given them information about you. And they\r\nhave lots of agents, even people who don't know that they're serving\r\nthe society. They've always kept a watch on you. One of the things Pyotr\r\nVerhovensky came here for was to settle your business once for all, and\r\nhe is fully authorised to do so, that is at the first good opportunity,\r\nto get rid of you, as a man who knows too much and might give them away.","I repeat that this is certain, and allow me to add that they are, for\r\nsome reason, convinced that you are a spy, and that if you haven't\r\ninformed against them yet, you will. Is that true?\"\r\n\r\nShatov made a wry face at hearing such a question asked in such a\r\nmatter-of fact tone.\r\n\r\n\"If I were a spy, whom could I inform?\" he said angrily, not giving a\r\ndirect answer. \"No, leave me alone, let me go to the devil!\" he cried\r\nsuddenly, catching again at his original idea, which agitated him\r\nviolently.","Apparently it affected him more deeply than the news of his\r\nown danger. \"You, you, Stavrogin, how could you mix yourself up with\r\nsuch shameful, stupid, second-hand absurdity? You a member of the\r\nsociety? What an exploit for Stavrogin!\" he cried suddenly, in despair.\r\n\r\nHe clasped his hands, as though nothing could be a bitterer and more\r\ninconsolable grief to him than such a discovery.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me,\" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, extremely surprised, \"but you\r\nseem to look upon me as a sort of sun, and on yourself as an insect in\r\ncomparison.","I noticed that even from your letter in America.\"\r\n\r\n\"You... you know.... Oh, let us drop me altogether,\" Shatov broke off\r\nsuddenly, \"and if you can explain anything about yourself explain it....\r\nAnswer my question!\" he repeated feverishly.\r\n\r\n\"With pleasure. You ask how I could get into such a den? After what\r\nI have told you, I'm bound to be frank with you to some extent on the\r\nsubject. You see, strictly speaking, I don't belong to the society at\r\nall, and I never have belonged to it, and I've much more right than\r\nyou to leave them, because I never joined them.","In fact, from the very\r\nbeginning I told them that I was not one of them, and that if I've\r\nhappened to help them it has simply been by accident as a man of\r\nleisure. I took some part in reorganising the society, on the new plan,\r\nbut that was all. But now they've changed their views, and have made up\r\ntheir minds that it would be dangerous to let me go, and I believe I'm\r\nsentenced to death too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they do nothing but sentence to death, and all by means of sealed\r\ndocuments, signed by three men and a half.","And you think they've any\r\npower!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're partly right there and partly not,\" Stavrogin answered with the\r\nsame indifference, almost listlessness. \"There's no doubt that there's a\r\ngreat deal that's fanciful about it, as there always is in such cases: a\r\nhandful magnifies its size and significance. To my thinking, if you will\r\nhave it, the only one is Pyotr Verhovensky, and it's simply good-nature\r\non his part to consider himself only an agent of the society.","But\r\nthe fundamental idea is no stupider than others of the sort. They are\r\nconnected with the _Internationale._ They have succeeded in establishing\r\nagents in Russia, they have even hit on a rather original method, though\r\nit's only theoretical, of course. As for their intentions here, the\r\nmovements of our Russian organisation are something so obscure and\r\nalmost always unexpected that really they might try anything among us.","Note that Verhovensky is an obstinate man.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a bug, an ignoramus, a buffoon, who understands nothing in\r\nRussia!\" cried Shatov spitefully.\r\n\r\n\"You know him very little. It's quite true that none of them understand\r\nmuch about Russia, but not much less than you and I do. Besides,\r\nVerhovensky is an enthusiast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Verhovensky an enthusiast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. There is a point when he ceases to be a buffoon and becomes\r\na madman.","I beg you to remember your own expression: 'Do you know how\r\npowerful a single man may be?' Please don't laugh about it, he's quite\r\ncapable of pulling a trigger. They are convinced that I am a spy too.\r\nAs they don't know how to do things themselves, they're awfully fond of\r\naccusing people of being spies.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you're not afraid, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"N--no. I'm not very much afraid.... But your case is quite different.","I\r\nwarned you that you might anyway keep it in mind. To my thinking there's\r\nno reason to be offended in being threatened with danger by fools; their\r\nbrains don't affect the question. They've raised their hand against\r\nbetter men than you or me. It's a quarter past eleven, though.\" He\r\nlooked at his watch and got up from his chair. \"I wanted to ask you one\r\nquite irrelevant question.\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake!\" cried Shatov, rising impulsively from his seat.","\"I beg your pardon?\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch looked at him inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"Ask it, ask your question for God's sake,\" Shatov repeated in\r\nindescribable excitement, \"but on condition that I ask you a question\r\ntoo. I beseech you to allow me... I can't... ask your question!\"\r\n\r\nStavrogin waited a moment and then began. \"I've heard that you have some\r\ninfluence on Marya Timofyevna, and that she was fond of seeing you and\r\nhearing you talk.","Is that so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes... she used to listen...\" said Shatov, confused.\r\n\r\n\"Within a day or two I intend to make a public announcement of our\r\nmarriage here in the town.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that possible?\" Shatov whispered, almost with horror.\r\n\r\n\"I don't quite understand you. There's no sort of difficulty about it,\r\nwitnesses to the marriage are here. Everything took place in Petersburg,\r\nperfectly legally and smoothly, and if it has not been made known till\r\nnow, it is simply because the witnesses, Kirillov, Pyotr Verhovensky,\r\nand Lebyadkin (whom I now have the pleasure of claiming as a\r\nbrother-in-law) promised to hold their tongues.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean that... You speak so calmly... but good! Listen! You\r\nweren't forced into that marriage, were you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no one forced me into it.\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch smiled at\r\nShatov's importunate haste.\r\n\r\n\"And what's that talk she keeps up about her baby?\" Shatov interposed\r\ndisconnectedly, with feverish haste.\r\n\r\n\"She talks about her baby? Bah! I didn't know. It's the first time\r\nI've heard of it.","She never had a baby and couldn't have had: Marya\r\nTimofyevna is a virgin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! That's just what I thought! Listen!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with you, Shatov?\"\r\n\r\nShatov hid his face in his hands, turned away, but suddenly clutched\r\nStavrogin by the shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know why, do you know why, anyway,\" he shouted, \"why you did all\r\nthis, and why you are resolved on such a punishment now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your question is clever and malignant, but I mean to surprise you too;\r\nI fancy I do know why I got married then, and why I am resolved on such\r\na punishment now, as you express it.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's leave that... of that later. Put it off. Let's talk of the chief\r\nthing, the chief thing. I've been waiting two years for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've waited too long for you. I've been thinking of you incessantly.\r\nYou are the only man who could move... I wrote to you about it from\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember your long letter very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too long to be read? No doubt; six sheets of notepaper.","Don't speak!\r\nDon't speak! Tell me, can you spare me another ten minutes?... But now,\r\nthis minute... I have waited for you too long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, half an hour if you like, but not more, if that will suit\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"And on condition, too,\" Shatov put in wrathfully, \"that you take a\r\ndifferent tone. Do you hear? I demand when I ought to entreat. Do you\r\nunderstand what it means to demand when one ought to entreat?\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand that in that way you lift yourself above all\r\nordinary considerations for the sake of loftier aims,\" said Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch with a faint smile.","\"I see with regret, too, that you're\r\nfeverish.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg you to treat me with respect, I insist on it!\" shouted Shatov,\r\n\"not my personality--I don't care a hang for that, but something else,\r\njust for this once. While I am talking... we are two beings, and have\r\ncome together in infinity... for the last time in the world. Drop your\r\ntone, and speak like a human being! Speak, if only for once in your life\r\nwith the voice of a man.","I say it not for my sake but for yours. Do you\r\nunderstand that you ought to forgive me that blow in the face if only\r\nbecause I gave you the opportunity of realising your immense power.\r\n... Again you smile your disdainful, worldly smile! Oh, when will you\r\nunderstand me! Have done with being a snob! Understand that I insist\r\non that. I insist on it, else I won't speak, I'm not going to for\r\nanything!\"\r\n\r\nHis excitement was approaching frenzy.","Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch frowned\r\nand seemed to become more on his guard.\r\n\r\n\"Since I have remained another half-hour with you when time is so\r\nprecious,\" he pronounced earnestly and impressively, \"you may rest\r\nassured that I mean to listen to you at least with interest... and I am\r\nconvinced that I shall hear from you much that is new.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down on a chair.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down!\" cried Shatov, and he sat down himself.","\"Please remember,\" Stavrogin interposed once more, \"that I was about\r\nto ask a real favour of you concerning Marya Timofyevna, of great\r\nimportance for her, anyway....\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" Shatov frowned suddenly with the air of a man who has just been\r\ninterrupted at the most important moment, and who gazes at you unable to\r\ngrasp the question.\r\n\r\n\"And you did not let me finish,\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch went on with a\r\nsmile.","\"Oh, nonsense, afterwards!\" Shatov waved his hand disdainfully,\r\ngrasping, at last, what he wanted, and passed at once to his principal\r\ntheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" he began, with flashing eyes, almost menacingly, bending\r\nright forward in his chair, raising the forefinger of his right hand\r\nabove him (obviously unaware that he was doing so), \"do you know who are\r\nthe only 'god-bearing' people on earth, destined to regenerate and save\r\nthe world in the name of a new God, and to whom are given the keys of\r\nlife and of the new world.",".. Do you know which is that people and what\r\nis its name?\"\r\n\r\n\"From your manner I am forced to conclude, and I think I may as well do\r\nso at once, that it is the Russian people.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you can laugh, oh, what a race!\" Shatov burst out.\r\n\r\n\"Calm yourself, I beg of you; on the contrary, I was expecting something\r\nof the sort from you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You expected something of the sort? And don't you know those words\r\nyourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know them very well.","I see only too well what you're driving at. All\r\nyour phrases, even the expression 'god-bearing people' is only a sequel\r\nto our talk two years ago, abroad, not long before you went to America.\r\n... At least, as far as I can recall it now.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's your phrase altogether, not mine. Your own, not simply the sequel\r\nof our conversation. 'Our' conversation it was not at all. It was a\r\nteacher uttering weighty words, and a pupil who was raised from the\r\ndead.","I was that pupil and you were the teacher.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, if you remember, it was just after my words you joined their\r\nsociety, and only afterwards went away to America.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I wrote to you from America about that. I wrote to you about\r\neverything. Yes, I could not at once tear my bleeding heart from what\r\nI had grown into from childhood, on which had been lavished all the\r\nraptures of my hopes and all the tears of my hatred.","... It is difficult\r\nto change gods. I did not believe you then, because I did not want to\r\nbelieve, I plunged for the last time into that sewer.... But the seed\r\nremained and grew up. Seriously, tell me seriously, didn't you read all\r\nmy letter from America, perhaps you didn't read it at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"I read three pages of it. The two first and the last. And I glanced\r\nthrough the middle as well. But I was always meaning.","..\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, never mind, drop it! Damn it!\" cried Shatov, waving his hand. \"If\r\nyou've renounced those words about the people now, how could you have\r\nuttered them then?... That's what crushes me now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't joking with you then; in persuading you I was perhaps\r\nmore concerned with myself than with you,\" Stavrogin pronounced\r\nenigmatically.\r\n\r\n\"You weren't joking! In America I was lying for three months on straw\r\nbeside a hapless creature, and I learnt from him that at the very time\r\nwhen you were sowing the seed of God and the Fatherland in my heart, at\r\nthat very time, perhaps during those very days, you were infecting the\r\nheart of that hapless creature, that maniac Kirillov, with poison.",".. you\r\nconfirmed false malignant ideas in him, and brought him to the verge of\r\ninsanity.... Go, look at him now, he is your creation... you've seen him\r\nthough.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, I must observe that Kirillov himself told me that\r\nhe is happy and that he's good. Your supposition that all this was going\r\non at the same time is almost correct. But what of it? I repeat, I was\r\nnot deceiving either of you.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you an atheist? An atheist now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as I was then.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't asking you to treat me with respect when I began the\r\nconversation. With your intellect you might have understood that,\"\r\nShatov muttered indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't get up at your first word, I didn't close the conversation,\r\nI didn't go away from you, but have been sitting here ever since\r\nsubmissively answering your questions and.",".. cries, so it seems I have\r\nnot been lacking in respect to you yet.\"\r\n\r\nShatov interrupted, waving his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember your expression that 'an atheist can't be a Russian,'\r\nthat 'an atheist at once ceases to be a Russian'? Do you remember saying\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I?\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch questioned him back.\r\n\r\n\"You ask? You've forgotten? And yet that was one of the truest statements\r\nof the leading peculiarity of the Russian soul, which you divined.","You\r\ncan't have forgotten it! I will remind you of something else: you said\r\nthen that 'a man who was not orthodox could not be Russian.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I imagine that's a Slavophil idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Slavophils of to-day disown it. Nowadays, people have grown\r\ncleverer. But you went further: you believed that Roman Catholicism was\r\nnot Christianity; you asserted that Rome proclaimed Christ subject to\r\nthe third temptation of the devil.","Announcing to all the world that\r\nChrist without an earthly kingdom cannot hold his ground upon earth,\r\nCatholicism by so doing proclaimed Antichrist and ruined the whole\r\nWestern world. You pointed out that if France is in agonies now it's\r\nsimply the fault of Catholicism, for she has rejected the iniquitous God\r\nof Rome and has not found a new one. That's what you could say then! I\r\nremember our conversations.","\"\r\n\r\n\"If I believed, no doubt I should repeat it even now. I wasn't lying\r\nwhen I spoke as though I had faith,\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch pronounced\r\nvery earnestly. \"But I must tell you, this repetition of my ideas in the\r\npast makes a very disagreeable impression on me. Can't you leave off?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you believe it?\" repeated Shatov, paying not the slightest attention\r\nto this request. \"But didn't you tell me that if it were mathematically\r\nproved to you that the truth excludes Christ, you'd prefer to stick to\r\nChrist rather than to the truth? Did you say that? Did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"But allow me too at last to ask a question,\" said Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch, raising his voice.","\"What is the object of this\r\nirritable and... malicious cross-examination?\"\r\n\r\n\"This examination will be over for all eternity, and you will never hear\r\nit mentioned again.\"\r\n\r\n\"You keep insisting that we are outside the limits of time and space.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue!\" Shatov cried suddenly. \"I am stupid and awkward, but\r\nlet my name perish in ignominy! Let me repeat your leading idea.... Oh,\r\nonly a dozen lines, only the conclusion.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Repeat it, if it's only the conclusion....\" Stavrogin made a movement\r\nto look at his watch, but restrained himself and did not look.\r\n\r\nShatov bent forward in his chair again and again held up his finger for\r\na moment.\r\n\r\n\"Not a single nation,\" he went on, as though reading it line by line,\r\nstill gazing menacingly at Stavrogin, \"not a single nation has ever\r\nbeen founded on principles of science or reason.","There has never been\r\nan example of it, except for a brief moment, through folly. Socialism\r\nis from its very nature bound to be atheism, seeing that it has from the\r\nvery first proclaimed that it is an atheistic organisation of society,\r\nand that it intends to establish itself exclusively on the elements of\r\nscience and reason. Science and reason have, from the beginning of time,\r\nplayed a secondary and subordinate part in the life of nations; so it\r\nwill be till the end of time.","Nations are built up and moved by another\r\nforce which sways and dominates them, the origin of which is unknown and\r\ninexplicable: that force is the force of an insatiable desire to go on\r\nto the end, though at the same time it denies that end. It is the force\r\nof the persistent assertion of one's own existence, and a denial of\r\ndeath. It's the spirit of life, as the Scriptures call it, 'the river of\r\nliving water,' the drying up of which is threatened in the Apocalypse.","It's the √¶sthetic principle, as the philosophers call it, the ethical\r\nprinciple with which they identify it, 'the seeking for God,' as I call\r\nit more simply. The object of every national movement, in every people\r\nand at every period of its existence is only the seeking for its god,\r\nwho must be its own god, and the faith in Him as the only true one.\r\nGod is the synthetic personality of the whole people, taken from its\r\nbeginning to its end.","It has never happened that all, or even many,\r\npeoples have had one common god, but each has always had its own. It's\r\na sign of the decay of nations when they begin to have gods in common.\r\nWhen gods begin to be common to several nations the gods are dying and\r\nthe faith in them, together with the nations themselves. The stronger\r\na people the more individual their God. There never has been a nation\r\nwithout a religion, that is, without an idea of good and evil.","Every\r\npeople has its own conception of good and evil, and its own good and\r\nevil. When the same conceptions of good and evil become prevalent\r\nin several nations, then these nations are dying, and then the very\r\ndistinction between good and evil is beginning to disappear. Reason\r\nhas never had the power to define good and evil, or even to distinguish\r\nbetween good and evil, even approximately; on the contrary, it has\r\nalways mixed them up in a disgraceful and pitiful way; science has even\r\ngiven the solution by the fist.","This is particularly characteristic\r\nof the half-truths of science, the most terrible scourge of humanity,\r\nunknown till this century, and worse than plague, famine, or war. A\r\nhalf-truth is a despot... such as has never been in the world before.\r\nA despot that has its priests and its slaves, a despot to whom all do\r\nhomage with love and superstition hitherto inconceivable, before which\r\nscience itself trembles and cringes in a shameful way.","These are your\r\nown words, Stavrogin, all except that about the half-truth; that's my\r\nown because I am myself a case of half-knowledge, and that's why I hate\r\nit particularly. I haven't altered anything of your ideas or even of\r\nyour words, not a syllable.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't agree that you've not altered anything,\" Stavrogin observed\r\ncautiously. \"You accepted them with ardour, and in your ardour have\r\ntransformed them unconsciously.","The very fact that you reduce God to a\r\nsimple attribute of nationality...\"\r\n\r\nHe suddenly began watching Shatov with intense and peculiar attention,\r\nnot so much his words as himself.\r\n\r\n\"I reduce God to the attribute of nationality?\" cried Shatov. \"On the\r\ncontrary, I raise the people to God. And has it ever been otherwise? The\r\npeople is the body of God. Every people is only a people so long as it\r\nhas its own god and excludes all other gods on earth irreconcilably; so\r\nlong as it believes that by its god it will conquer and drive out of\r\nthe world all other gods.","Such, from the beginning of time, has been\r\nthe belief of all great nations, all, anyway, who have been specially\r\nremarkable, all who have been leaders of humanity. There is no going\r\nagainst facts. The Jews lived only to await the coming of the true\r\nGod and left the world the true God. The Greeks deified nature and\r\nbequeathed the world their religion, that is, philosophy and art. Rome\r\ndeified the people in the State, and bequeathed the idea of the State to\r\nthe nations.","France throughout her long history was only the incarnation\r\nand development of the Roman god, and if they have at last flung their\r\nRoman god into the abyss and plunged into atheism, which, for the time\r\nbeing, they call socialism, it is solely because socialism is, anyway,\r\nhealthier than Roman Catholicism. If a great people does not believe\r\nthat the truth is only to be found in itself alone (in itself alone\r\nand in it exclusively); if it does not believe that it alone is fit and\r\ndestined to raise up and save all the rest by its truth, it would at\r\nonce sink into being ethnographical material, and not a great people.","A\r\nreally great people can never accept a secondary part in the history\r\nof Humanity, nor even one of the first, but will have the first part. A\r\nnation which loses this belief ceases to be a nation. But there is only\r\none truth, and therefore only a single one out of the nations can have\r\nthe true God, even though other nations may have great gods of their\r\nown. Only one nation is 'god-bearing,' that's the Russian people,\r\nand.",".. and... and can you think me such a fool, Stavrogin,\" he yelled\r\nfrantically all at once, \"that I can't distinguish whether my words at\r\nthis moment are the rotten old commonplaces that have been ground out in\r\nall the Slavophil mills in Moscow, or a perfectly new saying, the last\r\nword, the sole word of renewal and resurrection, and... and what do I\r\ncare for your laughter at this minute! What do I care that you utterly,\r\nutterly fail to understand me, not a word, not a sound! Oh, how I\r\ndespise your haughty laughter and your look at this minute!\"\r\n\r\nHe jumped up from his seat; there was positively foam on his lips.","\"On the contrary Shatov, on the contrary,\" Stavrogin began with\r\nextraordinary earnestness and self-control, still keeping his seat, \"on\r\nthe contrary, your fervent words have revived many extremely powerful\r\nrecollections in me. In your words I recognise my own mood two years\r\nago, and now I will not tell you, as I did just now, that you have\r\nexaggerated my ideas. I believe, indeed, that they were even more\r\nexceptional, even more independent, and I assure you for the third time\r\nthat I should be very glad to confirm all that you've said just now,\r\nevery syllable of it, but.","..\"\r\n\r\n\"But you want a hare?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wh-a-t?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your own nasty expression,\" Shatov laughed spitefully, sitting down\r\nagain. \"To cook your hare you must first catch it, to believe in God\r\nyou must first have a god. You used to say that in Petersburg, I'm told,\r\nlike Nozdryov, who tried to catch a hare by his hind legs.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, what he did was to boast he'd caught him. By the way, allow me to\r\ntrouble you with a question though, for indeed I think I have the right\r\nto one now.","Tell me, have you caught your hare?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't dare to ask me in such words! Ask differently, quite\r\ndifferently.\" Shatov suddenly began trembling all over.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I'll ask differently.\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch looked coldly\r\nat him. \"I only wanted to know, do you believe in God, yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe in Russia.... I believe in her orthodoxy.... I believe in\r\nthe body of Christ.... I believe that the new advent will take place in\r\nRussia.","... I believe...\" Shatov muttered frantically.\r\n\r\n\"And in God? In God?\"\r\n\r\n\"I... I will believe in God.\"\r\n\r\nNot one muscle moved in Stavrogin's face. Shatov looked passionately and\r\ndefiantly at him, as though he would have scorched him with his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't told you that I don't believe,\" he cried at last. \"I will\r\nonly have you know that I am a luckless, tedious book, and nothing more\r\nso far, so far.","... But confound me! We're discussing you not me.... I'm\r\na man of no talent, and can only give my blood, nothing more, like every\r\nman without talent; never mind my blood either! I'm talking about you.\r\nI've been waiting here two years for you.... Here I've been dancing\r\nabout in my nakedness before you for the last half-hour. You, only you\r\ncan raise that flag!...\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off, and sat as though in despair, with his elbows on the table\r\nand his head in his hands.","\"I merely mention it as something queer,\" Stavrogin interrupted\r\nsuddenly. \"Every one for some inexplicable reason keeps foisting a flag\r\nupon me. Pyotr Verhovensky, too, is convinced that I might 'raise his\r\nflag,' that's how his words were repeated to me, anyway. He has taken it\r\ninto his head that I'm capable of playing the part of Stenka Razin for\r\nthem, 'from my extraordinary aptitude for crime,' his saying too.","\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" cried Shatov, \"'from your extraordinary aptitude for crime'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm! And is it true?\" he asked, with an angry smile. \"Is it true\r\nthat when you were in Petersburg you belonged to a secret society for\r\npractising beastly sensuality? Is it true that you could give lessons to\r\nthe Marquis de Sade? Is it true that you decoyed and corrupted children?\r\nSpeak, don't dare to lie,\" he cried, beside himself.","\"Nikolay Stavrogin\r\ncannot lie to Shatov, who struck him in the face. Tell me everything,\r\nand if it's true I'll kill you, here, on the spot!\"\r\n\r\n\"I did talk like that, but it was not I who outraged children,\"\r\nStavrogin brought out, after a silence that lasted too long. He turned\r\npale and his eyes gleamed.\r\n\r\n\"But you talked like that,\" Shatov went on imperiously, keeping his\r\nflashing eyes fastened upon him.","\"Is it true that you declared that you\r\nsaw no distinction in beauty between some brutal obscene action and any\r\ngreat exploit, even the sacrifice of life for the good of humanity? Is\r\nit true that you have found identical beauty, equal enjoyment, in both\r\nextremes?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's impossible to answer like this.... I won't answer,\" muttered\r\nStavrogin, who might well have got up and gone away, but who did not get\r\nup and go away.","\"I don't know either why evil is hateful and good is beautiful, but I\r\nknow why the sense of that distinction is effaced and lost in people\r\nlike the Stavrogins,\" Shatov persisted, trembling all over. \"Do you know\r\nwhy you made that base and shameful marriage? Simply because the shame\r\nand senselessness of it reached the pitch of genius! Oh, you are not\r\none of those who linger on the brink. You fly head foremost.","You married\r\nfrom a passion for martyrdom, from a craving for remorse, through moral\r\nsensuality. It was a laceration of the nerves... Defiance of common\r\nsense was too tempting. Stavrogin and a wretched, half-witted, crippled\r\nbeggar! When you bit the governor's ear did you feel sensual pleasure?\r\nDid you? You idle, loafing, little snob. Did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a psychologist,\" said Stavrogin, turning paler and paler,\r\n\"though you're partly mistaken as to the reasons of my marriage.","But\r\nwho can have given you all this information?\" he asked, smiling, with an\r\neffort. \"Was it Kirillov? But he had nothing to do with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You turn pale.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is it you want?\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch asked, raising\r\nhis voice at last. \"I've been sitting under your lash for the last\r\nhalf-hour, and you might at least let me go civilly. Unless you really\r\nhave some reasonable object in treating me like this.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Reasonable object?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, you're in duty bound, anyway, to let me know your object.\r\nI've been expecting you to do so all the time, but you've shown me\r\nnothing so far but frenzied spite. I beg you to open the gate for me.\"\r\n\r\nHe got up from the chair. Shatov rushed frantically after him. \"Kiss\r\nthe earth, water it with your tears, pray for forgiveness,\" he cried,\r\nclutching him by the shoulder.","\"I didn't kill you... that morning, though... I drew back my\r\nhands...\" Stavrogin brought out almost with anguish, keeping his eyes\r\non the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Speak out! Speak out! You came to warn me of danger. You have let me\r\nspeak. You mean to-morrow to announce your marriage publicly.... Do\r\nyou suppose I don't see from your face that some new menacing idea\r\nis dominating you?... Stavrogin, why am I condemned to believe in you\r\nthrough all eternity? Could I speak like this to anyone else? I have\r\nmodesty, but I am not ashamed of my nakedness because it's Stavrogin\r\nI am speaking to.","I was not afraid of caricaturing a grand idea by\r\nhandling it because Stavrogin was listening to me.... Shan't I kiss your\r\nfootprints when you've gone? I can't tear you out of my heart, Nikolay\r\nStavrogin!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry I can't feel affection for you, Shatov,\" Stavrogin replied\r\ncoldly.\r\n\r\n\"I know you can't, and I know you are not lying. Listen. I can set it\r\nall right. I can 'catch your hare' for you.","\"\r\n\r\nStavrogin did not speak.\r\n\r\n\"You're an atheist because you're a snob, a snob of the snobs. You've\r\nlost the distinction between good and evil because you've lost touch\r\nwith your own people. A new generation is coming, straight from the\r\nheart of the people, and you will know nothing of it, neither you nor\r\nthe Verhovenskys, father or son; nor I, for I'm a snob too--I, the son\r\nof your serf and lackey, Pashka.","... Listen. Attain to God by work; it\r\nall lies in that; or disappear like rotten mildew. Attain to Him by\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\n\"God by work? What sort of work?\"\r\n\r\n\"Peasants' work. Go, give up all your wealth.... Ah! you laugh, you're\r\nafraid of some trick?\"\r\n\r\nBut Stavrogin was not laughing.\r\n\r\n\"You suppose that one may attain to God by work, and by peasants' work,\"\r\nhe repeated, reflecting as though he had really come across something\r\nnew and serious which was worth considering.","\"By the way,\" he passed\r\nsuddenly to a new idea, \"you reminded me just now. Do you know that\r\nI'm not rich at all, that I've nothing to give up? I'm scarcely in\r\na position even to provide for Marya Timofyevna's future.... Another\r\nthing: I came to ask you if it would be possible for you to remain near\r\nMarya Timofyevna in the future, as you are the only person who has\r\nsome influence over her poor brain.","I say this so as to be prepared for\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, all right. You're speaking of Marya Timofyevna,\" said\r\nShatov, waving one hand, while he held a candle in the other. \"All\r\nright. Afterwards, of course.... Listen. Go to Tikhon.\"\r\n\r\n\"To whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Tikhon, who used to be a bishop. He lives retired now, on account of\r\nillness, here in the town, in the Bogorodsky monastery.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.","People go and see him. You go. What is it to you? What is it\r\nto you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the first time I've heard of him, and... I've never seen anything\r\nof that sort of people. Thank you, I'll go.\"\r\n\r\n\"This way.\"\r\n\r\nShatov lighted him down the stairs. \"Go along.\" He flung open the gate\r\ninto the street.\r\n\r\n\"I shan't come to you any more, Shatov,\" said Stavrogin quietly as he\r\nstepped through the gateway.","The darkness and the rain continued as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. NIGHT (continued)\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nHE WALKED THE LENGTH of Bogoyavlensky Street. At last the road began\r\nto go downhill; his feet slipped in the mud and suddenly there lay\r\nopen before him a wide, misty, as it were empty expanse--the river. The\r\nhouses were replaced by hovels; the street was lost in a multitude of\r\nirregular little alleys.","Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was a long while making his way between\r\nthe fences, keeping close to the river bank, but finding his way\r\nconfidently, and scarcely giving it a thought indeed. He was absorbed in\r\nsomething quite different, and looked round with surprise when suddenly,\r\nwaking up from a profound reverie, he found himself almost in the middle\r\nof one long, wet, floating bridge.\r\n\r\nThere was not a soul to be seen, so that it seemed strange to him when\r\nsuddenly, almost at his elbow, he heard a deferentially familiar, but\r\nrather pleasant, voice, with a suave intonation, such as is affected by\r\nour over-refined tradespeople or befrizzled young shop assistants.","\"Will you kindly allow me, sir, to share your umbrella?\"\r\n\r\nThere actually was a figure that crept under his umbrella, or tried to\r\nappear to do so. The tramp was walking beside him, almost \"feeling\r\nhis elbow,\" as the soldiers say. Slackening his pace, Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch bent down to look more closely, as far as he could, in\r\nthe darkness. It was a short man, and seemed like an artisan who had\r\nbeen drinking; he was shabbily and scantily dressed; a cloth cap, soaked\r\nby the rain and with the brim half torn off, perched on his shaggy,\r\ncurly head.","He looked a thin, vigorous, swarthy man with dark hair;\r\nhis eyes were large and must have been black, with a hard glitter and a\r\nyellow tinge in them, like a gipsy's; that could be divined even in the\r\ndarkness. He was about forty, and was not drunk.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know me?\" asked Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch. \"Mr. Stavrogin, Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch. You were pointed out to me at the station, when the\r\ntrain stopped last Sunday, though I had heard enough of you beforehand.","\"\r\n\r\n\"From Pyotr Stepanovitch? Are you... Fedka the convict?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was christened Fyodor Fyodorovitch. My mother is living to this day\r\nin these parts; she's an old woman, and grows more and more bent every\r\nday. She prays to God for me, day and night, so that she doesn't waste\r\nher old age lying on the stove.\"\r\n\r\n\"You escaped from prison?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've had a change of luck. I gave up books and bells and church-going\r\nbecause I'd a life sentence, so that I had a very long time to finish my\r\nterm.","\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I do what I can. My uncle, too, died last week in prison here. He\r\nwas there for false coin, so I threw two dozen stones at the dogs by\r\nway of memorial. That's all I've been doing so far. Moreover Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch gives me hopes of a passport, and a merchant's one, too, to\r\ngo all over Russia, so I'm waiting on his kindness. 'Because,' says he,\r\n'my papa lost you at cards at the English club, and I,' says he, 'find\r\nthat inhumanity unjust.","' You might have the kindness to give me three\r\nroubles, sir, for a glass to warm myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you've been spying on me. I don't like that. By whose orders?\"\r\n\r\n\"As to orders, it's nothing of the sort; it's simply that I knew of your\r\nbenevolence, which is known to all the world. All we get, as you know,\r\nis an armful of hay, or a prod with a fork. Last Friday I filled myself\r\nas full of pie as Martin did of soap; since then I didn't eat one day,\r\nand the day after I fasted, and on the third I'd nothing again.","I've had\r\nmy fill of water from the river. I'm breeding fish in my belly.... So\r\nwon't your honour give me something? I've a sweetheart expecting me not\r\nfar from here, but I daren't show myself to her without money.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did Pyotr Stepanovitch promise you from me?\"\r\n\r\n\"He didn't exactly promise anything, but only said that I might be of\r\nuse to your honour if my luck turns out good, but how exactly he didn't\r\nexplain; for Pyotr Stepanovitch wants to see if I have the patience of a\r\nCossack, and feels no sort of confidence in me.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pyotr Stepanovitch is an astronomer, and has learnt all God's planets,\r\nbut even he may be criticised. I stand before you, sir, as before God,\r\nbecause I have heard so much about you. Pyotr Stepanovitch is one thing,\r\nbut you, sir, maybe, are something else. When he's said of a man he's a\r\nscoundrel, he knows nothing more about him except that he's a scoundrel.\r\nOr if he's said he's a fool, then that man has no calling with him\r\nexcept that of fool.","But I may be a fool Tuesday and Wednesday, and on\r\nThursday wiser than he. Here now he knows about me that I'm awfully\r\nsick to get a passport, for there's no getting on in Russia without\r\npapers--so he thinks that he's snared my soul. I tell you, sir, life's\r\na very easy business for Pyotr Stepanovitch, for he fancies a man to be\r\nthis and that, and goes on as though he really was. And, what's more,\r\nhe's beastly stingy.","It's his notion that, apart from him, I daren't\r\ntrouble you, but I stand before you, sir, as before God. This is the\r\nfourth night I've been waiting for your honour on this bridge, to show\r\nthat I can find my own way on the quiet, without him. I'd better bow to\r\na boot, thinks I, than to a peasant's shoe.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who told you that I was going to cross the bridge at night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that, I'll own, came out by chance, most through Captain\r\nLebyadkin's foolishness, because he can't keep anything to himself.","...\r\nSo that three roubles from your honour would pay me for the weary time\r\nI've had these three days and nights. And the clothes I've had soaked, I\r\nfeel that too much to speak of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to the left; you'll go to the right. Here's the end of the\r\nbridge. Listen, Fyodor; I like people to understand what I say, once for\r\nall. I won't give you a farthing. Don't meet me in future on the bridge\r\nor anywhere.","I've no need of you, and never shall have, and if you don't\r\nobey, I'll tie you and take you to the police. March!\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh-heh! Fling me something for my company, anyhow. I've cheered you on\r\nyour way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be off!\"\r\n\r\n\"But do you know the way here? There are all sorts of turnings.... I\r\ncould guide you; for this town is for all the world as though the devil\r\ncarried it in his basket and dropped it in bits here and there.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tie you up!\" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, turning upon him\r\nmenacingly.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you'll change your mind, sir; it's easy to ill-treat the\r\nhelpless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I see you can rely on yourself!\"\r\n\r\n\"I rely upon you, sir, and not very much on myself....\"\r\n\r\n\"I've no need of you at all. I've told you so already.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have need, that's how it is! I shall wait for you on the way\r\nback.","There's nothing for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I give you my word of honour if I meet you I'll tie you up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll get a belt ready for you to tie me with. A lucky journey to\r\nyou, sir. You kept the helpless snug under your umbrella. For that\r\nalone I'll be grateful to you to my dying day.\" He fell behind. Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch walked on to his destination, feeling disturbed. This\r\nman who had dropped from the sky was absolutely convinced that he was\r\nindispensable to him, Stavrogin, and was in insolent haste to tell him\r\nso.","He was being treated unceremoniously all round. But it was possible,\r\ntoo, that the tramp had not been altogether lying, and had tried\r\nto force his services upon him on his own initiative, without Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch's knowledge, and that would be more curious still.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe house which Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had reached stood alone in a\r\ndeserted lane between fences, beyond which market gardens stretched, at\r\nthe very end of the town.","It was a very solitary little wooden house,\r\nwhich was only just built and not yet weather-boarded. In one of the\r\nlittle windows the shutters were not yet closed, and there was a candle\r\nstanding on the window-ledge, evidently as a signal to the late guest\r\nwho was expected that night. Thirty paces away Stavrogin made out on the\r\ndoorstep the figure of a tall man, evidently the master of the house,\r\nwho had come out to stare impatiently up the road.","He heard his voice,\r\ntoo, impatient and, as it were, timid.\r\n\r\n\"Is that you? You?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" responded Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, but not till he had mounted\r\nthe steps and was folding up his umbrella.\r\n\r\n\"At last, sir.\" Captain Lebyadkin, for it was he, ran fussily to and\r\nfro. \"Let me take your umbrella, please. It's very wet; I'll open it on\r\nthe floor here, in the corner. Please walk in. Please walk in.","\"\r\n\r\nThe door was open from the passage into a room that was lighted by two\r\ncandles.\r\n\r\n\"If it had not been for your promise that you would certainly come, I\r\nshould have given up expecting you.\"\r\n\r\n\"A quarter to one,\" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, looking at his watch,\r\nas he went into the room.\r\n\r\n\"And in this rain; and such an interesting distance. I've no clock...\r\nand there are nothing but market-gardens round me.",".. so that you fall\r\nbehind the times. Not that I murmur exactly; for I dare not, I dare not,\r\nbut only because I've been devoured with impatience all the week... to\r\nhave things settled at last.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\"\r\n\r\n\"To hear my fate, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch. Please sit down.\"\r\n\r\nHe bowed, pointing to a seat by the table, before the sofa.\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch looked round. The room was tiny and low-pitched.","The furniture consisted only of the most essential articles, plain\r\nwooden chairs and a sofa, also newly made without covering or cushions.\r\nThere were two tables of limewood; one by the sofa, and the other in\r\nthe corner was covered with a table-cloth, laid with things over which\r\na clean table-napkin had been thrown. And, indeed, the whole room was\r\nobviously kept extremely clean.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lebyadkin had not been drunk for eight days.","His face looked\r\nbloated and yellow. His eyes looked uneasy, inquisitive, and obviously\r\nbewildered. It was only too evident that he did not know what tone he\r\ncould adopt, and what line it would be most advantageous for him to\r\ntake.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" he indicated his surroundings, \"I live like Zossima. Sobriety,\r\nsolitude, and poverty--the vow of the knights of old.\"\r\n\r\n\"You imagine that the knights of old took such vows?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I'm mistaken.","Alas! I have no culture. I've ruined all. Believe\r\nme, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, here first I have recovered from shameful\r\npropensities--not a glass nor a drop! I have a home, and for six days\r\npast I have experienced a conscience at ease. Even the walls smell of\r\nresin and remind me of nature. And what have I been; what was I?\r\n\r\n     'At night without a bed I wander\r\n     And my tongue put out by day.","..'\r\n\r\nto use the words of a poet of genius. But you're wet through....\r\nWouldn't you like some tea?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"The samovar has been boiling since eight o'clock, but it went out at\r\nlast like everything in this world. The sun, too, they say, will go\r\nout in its turn. But if you like I'll get up the samovar. Agafya is not\r\nasleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Marya Timofyevna...\"\r\n\r\n\"She's here, here,\" Lebyadkin replied at once, in a whisper.","\"Would you\r\nlike to have a look at her?\" He pointed to the closed door to the next\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\"She's not asleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, no. How could she be? On the contrary, she's been expecting\r\nyou all the evening, and as soon as she heard you were coming she began\r\nmaking her toilet.\"\r\n\r\nHe was just twisting his mouth into a jocose smile, but he instantly\r\nchecked himself.\r\n\r\n\"How is she, on the whole?\" asked Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, frowning.","\"On the whole? You know that yourself, sir.\" He shrugged his shoulders\r\ncommiseratingly. \"But just now... just now she's telling her fortune\r\nwith cards....\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good. Later on. First of all I must finish with you.\"\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch settled himself in a chair. The captain did not\r\nventure to sit down on the sofa, but at once moved up another chair for\r\nhimself, and bent forward to listen, in a tremor of expectation.","\"What have you got there under the table-cloth?\" asked Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch, suddenly noticing it.\r\n\r\n\"That?\" said Lebyadkin, turning towards it also. \"That's from your\r\ngenerosity, by way of house-warming, so to say; considering also\r\nthe length of the walk, and your natural fatigue,\" he sniggered\r\ningratiatingly. Then he got up on tiptoe, and respectfully and carefully\r\nlifted the table-cloth from the table in the corner.","Under it was seen a\r\nslight meal: ham, veal, sardines, cheese, a little green decanter, and a\r\nlong bottle of Bordeaux. Everything had been laid neatly, expertly, and\r\nalmost daintily.\r\n\r\n\"Was that your effort?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Ever since yesterday I've done my best, and all to do you\r\nhonour.... Marya Timofyevna doesn't trouble herself, as you know, on\r\nthat score. And what's more its all from your liberality, your own\r\nproviding, as you're the master of the house and not I, and I'm only, so\r\nto say, your agent.","All the same, all the same, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch,\r\nall the same, in spirit, I'm independent! Don't take away from me this\r\nlast possession!\" he finished up pathetically.\r\n\r\n\"H'm! You might sit down again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gra-a-teful, grateful, and independent.\" He sat down. \"Ah, Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch, so much has been fermenting in this heart that I have\r\nnot known how to wait for your coming. Now you will decide my fate,\r\nand.",".. that unhappy creature's, and then... shall I pour out all I feel\r\nto you as I used to in old days, four years ago? You deigned to listen\r\nto me then, you read my verses.... They might call me your Falstaff from\r\nShakespeare in those days, but you meant so much in my life! I have\r\ngreat terrors now, and it's only to you I look for counsel and light.\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch is treating me abominably!\"\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch listened with interest, and looked at him\r\nattentively.","It was evident that though Captain Lebyadkin had left off\r\ndrinking he was far from being in a harmonious state of mind.\r\nDrunkards of many years' standing, like Lebyadkin, often show traces of\r\nincoherence, of mental cloudiness, of something, as it were, damaged,\r\nand crazy, though they may deceive, cheat, and swindle, almost as well\r\nas anybody if occasion arises.\r\n\r\n\"I see that you haven't changed a bit in these four years and more,\r\ncaptain,\" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, somewhat more amiably.","\"It\r\nseems, in fact, as though the second half of a man's life is usually\r\nmade up of nothing but the habits he has accumulated during the first\r\nhalf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Grand words! You solve the riddle of life!\" said the captain, half\r\ncunningly, half in genuine and unfeigned admiration, for he was a\r\ngreat lover of words. \"Of all your sayings, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, I\r\nremember one thing above all; you were in Petersburg when you said it:\r\n'One must really be a great man to be able to make a stand even against\r\ncommon sense.","' That was it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and a fool as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"A fool as well, maybe. But you've been scattering clever sayings all\r\nyour life, while they.... Imagine Liputin, imagine Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\nsaying anything like that! Oh, how cruelly Pyotr Stepanovitch has\r\ntreated me!\"\r\n\r\n\"But how about yourself, captain? What can you say of your behaviour?\"\r\n\r\n\"Drunkenness, and the multitude of my enemies. But now that's all over,\r\nall over, and I have a new skin, like a snake.","Do you know, Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch, I am making my will; in fact, I've made it already?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's interesting. What are you leaving, and to whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"To my fatherland, to humanity, and to the students. Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch, I read in the paper the biography of an American. He\r\nleft all his vast fortune to factories and to the exact sciences, and\r\nhis skeleton to the students of the academy there, and his skin to be\r\nmade into a drum, so that the American national hymn might be beaten\r\nupon it day and night.","Alas! we are pigmies in mind compared with the\r\nsoaring thought of the States of North America. Russia is the play of\r\nnature but not of mind. If I were to try leaving my skin for a drum, for\r\ninstance, to the Akmolinsky infantry regiment, in which I had the honour\r\nof beginning my service, on condition of beating the Russian national\r\nhymn upon it every day, in face of the regiment, they'd take it for\r\nliberalism and prohibit my skin.",".. and so I confine myself to the\r\nstudents. I want to leave my skeleton to the academy, but on the\r\ncondition though, on the condition that a label should be stuck on the\r\nforehead forever and ever, with the words: 'A repentant free-thinker.'\r\nThere now!\"\r\n\r\nThe captain spoke excitedly, and genuinely believed, of course, that\r\nthere was something fine in the American will, but he was cunning too,\r\nand very anxious to entertain Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, with whom he had\r\nplayed the part of a buffoon for a long time in the past.","But the latter\r\ndid not even smile, on the contrary, he asked, as it were, suspiciously:\r\n\r\n\"So you intend to publish your will in your lifetime and get rewarded\r\nfor it?\"\r\n\r\n\"And what if I do, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch? What if I do?\" said\r\nLebyadkin, watching him carefully. \"What sort of luck have I had? I've\r\ngiven up writing poetry, and at one time even you were amused by my\r\nverses, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch.","Do you remember our reading them over a\r\nbottle? But it's all over with my pen. I've written only one poem, like\r\nGogol's 'The Last Story.' Do you remember he proclaimed to Russia that\r\nit broke spontaneously from his bosom? It's the same with me; I've sung\r\nmy last and it's over.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of poem?\"\r\n\r\n\"'In case she were to break her leg.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Wha-a-t?\"\r\n\r\nThat was all the captain was waiting for.","He had an unbounded admiration\r\nfor his own poems, but, through a certain cunning duplicity, he was\r\npleased, too, that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch always made merry over his\r\npoems, and sometimes laughed at them immoderately. In this way he killed\r\ntwo birds with one stone, satisfying at once his poetical aspirations\r\nand his desire to be of service; but now he had a third special and very\r\nticklish object in view.","Bringing his verses on the scene, the captain\r\nthought to exculpate himself on one point about which, for some reason,\r\nhe always felt himself most apprehensive, and most guilty.\r\n\r\n\"'In case of her breaking her leg.' That is, of her riding on\r\nhorseback. It's a fantasy, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, a wild fancy,\r\nbut the fancy of a poet. One day I was struck by meeting a lady on\r\nhorseback, and asked myself the vital question, 'What would happen\r\nthen?' That is, in case of accident.","All her followers turn away, all\r\nher suitors are gone. A pretty kettle of fish. Only the poet\r\nremains faithful, with his heart shattered in his breast, Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch. Even a louse may be in love, and is not forbidden by\r\nlaw. And yet the lady was offended by the letter and the verses. I'm\r\ntold that even you were angry. Were you? I wouldn't believe in anything\r\nso grievous. Whom could I harm simply by imagination? Besides, I swear\r\non my honour, Liputin kept saying, 'Send it, send it,' every man,\r\nhowever humble, has a right to send a letter! And so I sent it.","\"\r\n\r\n\"You offered yourself as a suitor, I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enemies, enemies, enemies!\"\r\n\r\n\"Repeat the verses,\" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch sternly.\r\n\r\n\"Ravings, ravings, more than anything.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, he drew himself up, stretched out his hand, and began:\r\n\r\n     \"With broken limbs my beauteous queen\r\n     Is twice as charming as before,\r\n     And, deep in love as I have been,\r\n     To-day I love her even more.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, that's enough,\" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, with a wave of his hand.\r\n\r\n\"I dream of Petersburg,\" cried Lebyadkin, passing quickly to another\r\nsubject, as though there had been no mention of verses. \"I dream of\r\nregeneration.... Benefactor! May I reckon that you won't refuse the means\r\nfor the journey? I've been waiting for you all the week as my sunshine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do nothing of the sort.","I've scarcely any money left. And why\r\nshould I give you money?\"\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch seemed suddenly angry. Dryly and briefly he\r\nrecapitulated all the captain's misdeeds; his drunkenness, his lying,\r\nhis squandering of the money meant for Marya Timofyevna, his having\r\ntaken her from the nunnery, his insolent letters threatening to publish\r\nthe secret, the way he had behaved about Darya Pavlovna, and so on, and\r\nso on.","The captain heaved, gesticulated, began to reply, but every time\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch stopped him peremptorily.\r\n\r\n\"And listen,\" he observed at last, \"you keep writing about 'family\r\ndisgrace.' What disgrace is it to you that your sister is the lawful\r\nwife of a Stavrogin?\"\r\n\r\n\"But marriage in secret, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch--a fatal secret. I\r\nreceive money from you, and I'm suddenly asked the question, 'What's\r\nthat money for?' My hands are tied; I cannot answer to the detriment of\r\nmy sister, to the detriment of the family honour.","\"\r\n\r\nThe captain raised his voice. He liked that subject and reckoned boldly\r\nupon it. Alas! he did not realise what a blow was in store for him.\r\n\r\nCalmly and exactly, as though he were speaking of the most everyday\r\narrangement, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch informed him that in a few days,\r\nperhaps even to-morrow or the day after, he intended to make his\r\nmarriage known everywhere, \"to the police as well as to local society.","\"\r\nAnd so the question of family honour would be settled once for all, and\r\nwith it the question of subsidy. The captain's eyes were ready to\r\ndrop out of his head; he positively could not take it in. It had to be\r\nexplained to him.\r\n\r\n\"But she is... crazy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall make suitable arrangements.\"\r\n\r\n\"But... how about your mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, she must do as she likes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But will you take your wife to your house?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps so.","But that is absolutely nothing to do with you and no\r\nconcern of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"No concern of mine!\" cried the captain. \"What about me then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, certainly you won't come into my house.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, you know, I'm a relation.\"\r\n\r\n\"One does one's best to escape from such relations. Why should I go on\r\ngiving you money then? Judge for yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, this is impossible.","You will think better of it, perhaps? You don't want to lay hands\r\nupon.... What will people think? What will the world say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Much I care for your world. I married your sister when the fancy took\r\nme, after a drunken dinner, for a bet, and now I'll make it public...\r\nsince that amuses me now.\"\r\n\r\nHe said this with a peculiar irritability, so that Lebyadkin began with\r\nhorror to believe him.\r\n\r\n\"But me, me? What about me? I'm what matters most!.",".. Perhaps you're\r\njoking, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not joking.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you will, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, but I don't believe you.... Then\r\nI'll take proceedings.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're fearfully stupid, captain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe, but this is all that's left me,\" said the captain, losing his\r\nhead completely. \"In old days we used to get free quarters, anyway, for\r\nthe work she did in the 'corners.' But what will happen now if you throw\r\nme over altogether?\"\r\n\r\n\"But you want to go to Petersburg to try a new career.","By the way, is it\r\ntrue what I hear, that you mean to go and give information, in the hope\r\nof obtaining a pardon, by betraying all the others?\"\r\n\r\nThe captain stood gaping with wide-open eyes, and made no answer.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, captain,\" Stavrogin began suddenly, with great earnestness,\r\nbending down to the table. Until then he had been talking, as it were,\r\nambiguously, so that Lebyadkin, who had wide experience in playing the\r\npart of buffoon, was up to the last moment a trifle uncertain whether\r\nhis patron were really angry or simply putting it on; whether he really\r\nhad the wild intention of making his marriage public, or whether he\r\nwere only playing.","Now Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch's stern expression was so\r\nconvincing that a shiver ran down the captain's back.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, and tell the truth, Lebyadkin. Have you betrayed anything yet,\r\nor not? Have you succeeded in doing anything really? Have you sent a\r\nletter to somebody in your foolishness?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I haven't... and I haven't thought of doing it,\" said the captain,\r\nlooking fixedly at him.\r\n\r\n\"That's a lie, that you haven't thought of doing it.","That's what you're\r\nasking to go to Petersburg for. If you haven't written, have you blabbed\r\nto anybody here? Speak the truth. I've heard something.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I was drunk, to Liputin. Liputin's a traitor. I opened my heart to\r\nhim,\" whispered the poor captain.\r\n\r\n\"That's all very well, but there's no need to be an ass. If you had an\r\nidea you should have kept it to yourself. Sensible people hold their\r\ntongues nowadays; they don't go chattering.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch!\" said the captain, quaking. \"You've had\r\nnothing to do with it yourself; it's not you I've...\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. You wouldn't have ventured to kill the goose that laid your golden\r\neggs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Judge for yourself, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, judge for yourself,\" and,\r\nin despair, with tears, the captain began hurriedly relating the story\r\nof his life for the last four years. It was the most stupid story of\r\na fool, drawn into matters that did not concern him, and in his\r\ndrunkenness and debauchery unable, till the last minute, to grasp their\r\nimportance.","He said that before he left Petersburg 'he had been drawn\r\nin, at first simply through friendship, like a regular student, although\r\nhe wasn't a student,' and knowing nothing about it, 'without being\r\nguilty of anything,' he had scattered various papers on staircases, left\r\nthem by dozens at doors, on bell-handles, had thrust them in as though\r\nthey were newspapers, taken them to the theatre, put them in people's\r\nhats, and slipped them into pockets.","Afterwards he had taken money from\r\nthem, 'for what means had I?' He had distributed all sorts of rubbish\r\nthrough the districts of two provinces. \"Oh, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch!\"\r\nhe exclaimed, \"what revolted me most was that this was utterly opposed\r\nto civic, and still more to patriotic laws. They suddenly printed that\r\nmen were to go out with pitchforks, and to remember that those who went\r\nout poor in the morning might go home rich at night.","Only think of it!\r\nIt made me shudder, and yet I distributed it. Or suddenly five or six\r\nlines addressed to the whole of Russia, apropos of nothing, 'Make haste\r\nand lock up the churches, abolish God, do away with marriage, destroy\r\nthe right of inheritance, take up your knives,' that's all, and God\r\nknows what it means. I tell you, I almost got caught with this five-line\r\nleaflet. The officers in the regiment gave me a thrashing, but, bless\r\nthem for it, let me go.","And last year I was almost caught when I passed\r\noff French counterfeit notes for fifty roubles on Korovayev, but, thank\r\nGod, Korovayev fell into the pond when he was drunk, and was drowned\r\nin the nick of time, and they didn't succeed in tracking me. Here, at\r\nVirginsky's, I proclaimed the freedom of the communistic life. In June\r\nI was distributing manifestoes again in X district. They say they\r\nwill make me do it again.","... Pyotr Stepanovitch suddenly gave me to\r\nunderstand that I must obey; he's been threatening me a long time. How\r\nhe treated me that Sunday! Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, I am a slave, I am\r\na worm, but not a God, which is where I differ from Derzhavin.* But I've\r\nno income, no income!\"\r\n\r\n     * The reference is to a poem of Derzhavin's.\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch heard it all with curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"A great deal of that I had heard nothing of,\" he said.","\"Of course,\r\nanything may have happened to you.... Listen,\" he said, after a minute's\r\nthought. \"If you like, you can tell them, you know whom, that Liputin\r\nwas lying, and that you were only pretending to give information to\r\nfrighten me, supposing that I, too, was compromised, and that you might\r\nget more money out of me that way.... Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, is it possible that there's such a danger\r\nhanging over me? I've been longing for you to come, to ask you.","\"\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch laughed.\r\n\r\n\"They certainly wouldn't let you go to Petersburg, even if I were to\r\ngive you money for the journey.... But it's time for me to see Marya\r\nTimofyevna.\" And he got up from his chair.\r\n\r\n\"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, but how about Marya Timofyevna?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, as I told you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can it be true?\"\r\n\r\n\"You still don't believe it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you really cast me off like an old worn-out shoe?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see,\" laughed Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch.","\"Come, let me go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't you like me to stand on the steps... for fear I might by\r\nchance overhear something... for the rooms are small?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's as well. Stand on the steps. Take my umbrella.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your umbrella.... Am I worth it?\" said the captain over-sweetly.\r\n\r\n\"Anyone is worthy of an umbrella.\"\r\n\r\n\"At one stroke you define the minimum of human rights....\"\r\n\r\nBut he was by now muttering mechanically.","He was too much crushed by\r\nwhat he had learned, and was completely thrown out of his reckoning. And\r\nyet almost as soon as he had gone out on to the steps and had put up\r\nthe umbrella, there his shallow and cunning brain caught again the\r\never-present, comforting idea that he was being cheated and deceived,\r\nand if so they were afraid of him, and there was no need for him to be\r\nafraid.\r\n\r\n\"If they're lying and deceiving me, what's at the bottom of it?\" was the\r\nthought that gnawed at his mind.","The public announcement of the marriage\r\nseemed to him absurd. \"It's true that with such a wonder-worker anything\r\nmay come to pass; he lives to do harm. But what if he's afraid himself,\r\nsince the insult of Sunday, and afraid as he's never been before? And\r\nso he's in a hurry to declare that he'll announce it himself, from fear\r\nthat I should announce it. Eh, don't blunder, Lebyadkin! And why does he\r\ncome on the sly, at night, if he means to make it public himself? And\r\nif he's afraid, it means that he's afraid now, at this moment, for these\r\nfew days.","... Eh, don't make a mistake, Lebyadkin!\r\n\r\n\"He scares me with Pyotr Stepanovitch. Oy, I'm frightened, I'm\r\nfrightened! Yes, this is what's so frightening! And what induced me to\r\nblab to Liputin. Goodness knows what these devils are up to. I never can\r\nmake head or tail of it. Now they are all astir again as they were five\r\nyears ago. To whom could I give information, indeed? 'Haven't I written\r\nto anyone in my foolishness?' H'm! So then I might write as though\r\nthrough foolishness? Isn't he giving me a hint? 'You're going to\r\nPetersburg on purpose.","' The sly rogue. I've scarcely dreamed of it, and\r\nhe guesses my dreams. As though he were putting me up to going himself.\r\nIt's one or the other of two games he's up to. Either he's afraid\r\nbecause he's been up to some pranks himself... or he's not afraid for\r\nhimself, but is simply egging me on to give them all away! Ach, it's\r\nterrible, Lebyadkin! Ach, you must not make a blunder!\"\r\n\r\nHe was so absorbed in thought that he forgot to listen.","It was not easy\r\nto hear either. The door was a solid one, and they were talking in a\r\nvery low voice. Nothing reached the captain but indistinct sounds. He\r\npositively spat in disgust, and went out again, lost in thought, to\r\nwhistle on the steps.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nMarya Timofyevna's room was twice as large as the one occupied by the\r\ncaptain, and furnished in the same rough style; but the table in front\r\nof the sofa was covered with a gay-coloured table-cloth, and on it a\r\nlamp was burning.","There was a handsome carpet on the floor. The bed was\r\nscreened off by a green curtain, which ran the length of the room, and\r\nbesides the sofa there stood by the table a large, soft easy chair, in\r\nwhich Marya Timofyevna never sat, however. In the corner there was an\r\nikon as there had been in her old room, and a little lamp was burning\r\nbefore it, and on the table were all her indispensable properties.","The\r\npack of cards, the little looking-glass, the song-book, even a milk\r\nloaf. Besides these there were two books with coloured pictures--one,\r\nextracts from a popular book of travels, published for juvenile reading,\r\nthe other a collection of very light, edifying tales, for the most part\r\nabout the days of chivalry, intended for Christmas presents or school\r\nreading. She had, too, an album of photographs of various sorts.","Marya Timofyevna was, of course, expecting the visitor, as the captain\r\nhad announced. But when Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch went in, she was asleep,\r\nhalf reclining on the sofa, propped on a woolwork cushion. Her visitor\r\nclosed the door after him noiselessly, and, standing still, scrutinised\r\nthe sleeping figure.\r\n\r\nThe captain had been romancing when he told Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch she\r\nhad been dressing herself up.","She was wearing the same dark dress as on\r\nSunday at Varvara Petrovna's. Her hair was done up in the same little\r\nclose knot at the back of her head; her long thin neck was exposed\r\nin the same way. The black shawl Varvara Petrovna had given her lay\r\ncarefully folded on the sofa. She was coarsely rouged and powdered as\r\nbefore. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch did not stand there more than a minute.\r\nShe suddenly waked up, as though she were conscious of his eyes\r\nfixed upon her; she opened her eyes, and quickly drew herself up.","But something strange must have happened to her visitor: he remained\r\nstanding at the same place by the door. With a fixed and searching\r\nglance he looked mutely and persistently into her face. Perhaps that\r\nlook was too grim, perhaps there was an expression of aversion in it,\r\neven a malignant enjoyment of her fright--if it were not a fancy left by\r\nher dreams; but suddenly, after almost a moment of expectation, the poor\r\nwoman's face wore a look of absolute terror; it twitched convulsively;\r\nshe lifted her trembling hands and suddenly burst into tears, exactly\r\nlike a frightened child; in another moment she would have screamed.","But\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch pulled himself together; his face changed in one\r\ninstant, and he went up to the table with the most cordial and amiable\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, Marya Timofyevna, I frightened you coming in suddenly when\r\nyou were asleep,\" he said, holding out his hand to her.\r\n\r\nThe sound of his caressing words produced their effect. Her fear\r\nvanished, although she still looked at him with dismay, evidently trying\r\nto understand something.","She held out her hands timorously also. At last\r\na shy smile rose to her lips.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, prince?\" she whispered, looking at him strangely.\r\n\r\n\"You must have had a bad dream,\" he went on, with a still more friendly\r\nand cordial smile.\r\n\r\n\"But how do you know that I was dreaming about that?\" And again she\r\nbegan trembling, and started back, putting up her hand as though to\r\nprotect herself, on the point of crying again.","\"Calm yourself. That's\r\nenough. What are you afraid of? Surely you know me?\" said Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch, trying to soothe her; but it was long before he\r\ncould succeed. She gazed at him dumbly with the same look of agonising\r\nperplexity, with a painful idea in her poor brain, and she still seemed\r\nto be trying to reach some conclusion. At one moment she dropped her\r\neyes, then suddenly scrutinised him in a rapid comprehensive glance.","At\r\nlast, though not reassured, she seemed to come to a conclusion.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down beside me, please, that I may look at you thoroughly later\r\non,\" she brought out with more firmness, evidently with a new object.\r\n\"But don't be uneasy, I won't look at you now. I'll look down. Don't you\r\nlook at me either till I ask you to. Sit down,\" she added, with positive\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\nA new sensation was obviously growing stronger and stronger in her.","Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch sat down and waited. Rather a long silence\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\"H'm! It all seems so strange to me,\" she suddenly muttered almost\r\ndisdainfully. \"Of course I was depressed by bad dreams, but why have I\r\ndreamt of you looking like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, let's have done with dreams,\" he said impatiently, turning to her\r\nin spite of her prohibition, and perhaps the same expression gleamed for\r\na moment in his eyes again.","He saw that she several times wanted, very\r\nmuch in fact, to look at him again, but that she obstinately controlled\r\nherself and kept her eyes cast down.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, prince,\" she raised her voice suddenly, \"listen prince....\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you turn away? Why don't you look at me? What's the object of\r\nthis farce?\" he cried, losing patience.\r\n\r\nBut she seemed not to hear him.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, prince,\" she repeated for the third time in a resolute voice,\r\nwith a disagreeable, fussy expression.","\"When you told me in the carriage\r\nthat our marriage was going to be made public, I was alarmed at there\r\nbeing an end to the mystery. Now I don't know. I've been thinking it all\r\nover, and I see clearly that I'm not fit for it at all. I know how to\r\ndress, and I could receive guests, perhaps. There's nothing much in\r\nasking people to have a cup of tea, especially when there are footmen.\r\nBut what will people say though? I saw a great deal that Sunday morning\r\nin that house.","That pretty young lady looked at me all the time,\r\nespecially after you came in. It was you came in, wasn't it? Her\r\nmother's simply an absurd worldly old woman. My Lebyadkin distinguished\r\nhimself too. I kept looking at the ceiling to keep from laughing; the\r\nceiling there is finely painted. His mother ought to be an abbess. I'm\r\nafraid of her, though she did give me a black shawl. Of course, they\r\nmust all have come to strange conclusions about me.","I wasn't vexed,\r\nbut I sat there, thinking what relation am I to them? Of course, from\r\na countess one doesn't expect any but spiritual qualities; for the\r\ndomestic ones she's got plenty of footmen; and also a little worldly\r\ncoquetry, so as to be able to entertain foreign travellers. But yet that\r\nSunday they did look upon me as hopeless. Only Dasha's an angel. I'm\r\nawfully afraid they may wound _him_ by some careless allusion to me.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be afraid, and don't be uneasy,\" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch,\r\nmaking a wry face.\r\n\r\n\"However, that doesn't matter to me, if he is a little ashamed of me,\r\nfor there will always be more pity than shame, though it differs with\r\npeople, of course. He knows, to be sure, that I ought rather to pity\r\nthem than they me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to be very much offended with them, Marya Timofyevna?\"\r\n\r\n\"I? Oh, no,\" she smiled with simple-hearted mirth.","\"Not at all. I looked\r\nat you all, then. You were all angry, you were all quarrelling. They\r\nmeet together, and they don't know how to laugh from their hearts. So\r\nmuch wealth and so little gaiety. It all disgusts me. Though I feel for\r\nno one now except myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've heard that you've had a hard life with your brother without me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who told you that? It's nonsense. It's much worse now. Now my dreams\r\nare not good, and my dreams are bad, because you've come.","What have you\r\ncome for, I'd like to know. Tell me please?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't you like to go back into the nunnery?\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew they'd suggest the nunnery again. Your nunnery is a fine marvel\r\nfor me! And why should I go to it? What should I go for now? I'm all\r\nalone in the world now. It's too late for me to begin a third life.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem very angry about something. Surely you're not afraid that I've\r\nleft off loving you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not troubling about you at all.","I'm afraid that I may leave off\r\nloving somebody.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\"I must have done him some great wrong,\" she added suddenly, as it were\r\nto herself, \"only I don't know what I've done wrong; that's always what\r\ntroubles me. Always, always, for the last five years. I've been afraid\r\nday and night that I've done him some wrong. I've prayed and prayed and\r\nalways thought of the great wrong I'd done him.","And now it turns out it\r\nwas true.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's turned out?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm only afraid whether there's something on _his_ side,\" she went on,\r\nnot answering his question, not hearing it in fact. \"And then, again, he\r\ncouldn't get on with such horrid people. The countess would have liked\r\nto eat me, though she did make me sit in the carriage beside her.\r\nThey're all in the plot. Surely he's not betrayed me?\" (Her chin and\r\nlips were twitching.",") \"Tell me, have you read about Grishka Otrepyev,\r\nhow he was cursed in seven cathedrals?\"\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch did not speak.\r\n\r\n\"But I'll turn round now and look at you.\" She seemed to decide\r\nsuddenly. \"You turn to me, too, and look at me, but more attentively. I\r\nwant to make sure for the last time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been looking at you for a long time.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm!\" said Marya Timofyevna, looking at him intently.","\"You've grown\r\nmuch fatter.\"\r\n\r\nShe wanted to say something more, but suddenly, for the third time,\r\nthe same terror instantly distorted her face, and again she drew back,\r\nputting her hand up before her.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with you?\" cried Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, almost\r\nenraged.\r\n\r\nBut her panic lasted only one instant, her face worked with a sort of\r\nstrange smile, suspicious and unpleasant.","\"I beg you, prince, get up and come in,\" she brought out suddenly, in a\r\nfirm, emphatic voice.\r\n\r\n\"Come in? Where am I to come in?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been fancying for five years how _he_ would come in. Get up and\r\ngo out of the door into the other room. I'll sit as though I weren't\r\nexpecting anything, and I'll take up a book, and suddenly you'll come in\r\nafter five years' travelling. I want to see what it will be like.","\"\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch ground his teeth, and muttered something to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"Enough,\" he said, striking the table with his open hand. \"I beg you to\r\nlisten to me, Marya Timofyevna. Do me the favour to concentrate all your\r\nattention if you can. You're not altogether mad, you know!\" he broke out\r\nimpatiently. \"Tomorrow I shall make our marriage public. You never will\r\nlive in a palace, get that out of your head.","Do you want to live with\r\nme for the rest of your life, only very far away from here? In the\r\nmountains in Switzerland, there's a place there.... Don't be afraid.\r\nI'll never abandon you or put you in a madhouse. I shall have money\r\nenough to live without asking anyone's help. You shall have a servant,\r\nyou shall do no work at all. Everything you want that's possible shall\r\nbe got for you. You shall pray, go where you like, and do what you like.","I won't touch you. I won't go away from the place myself at all. If you\r\nlike, I won't speak to you all my life, or if you like, you can tell\r\nme your stories every evening as you used to do in Petersburg in the\r\ncorners. I'll read aloud to you if you like. But it must be all your\r\nlife in the same place, and that place is a gloomy one. Will you? Are\r\nyou ready? You won't regret it, torment me with tears and curses, will\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nShe listened with extreme curiosity, and for a long time she was silent,\r\nthinking.","\"It all seems incredible to me,\" she said at last, ironically and\r\ndisdainfully. \"I might live for forty years in those mountains,\" she\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\"What of it? Let's live forty years then...\" said Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch, scowling.\r\n\r\n\"H'm! I won't come for anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not even with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"And what are you that I should go with you? I'm to sit on a mountain\r\nbeside him for forty years on end--a pretty story! And upon my word,\r\nhow long-suffering people have become nowadays! No, it cannot be that a\r\nfalcon has become an owl.","My prince is not like that!\" she said, raising\r\nher head proudly and triumphantly.\r\n\r\nLight seemed to dawn upon him.\r\n\r\n\"What makes you call me a prince, and... for whom do you take me?\" he\r\nasked quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, aren't you the prince?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never have been one.\"\r\n\r\n\"So yourself, yourself, you tell me straight to my face that you're not\r\nthe prince?\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you I never have been.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" she cried, clasping her hands.","\"I was ready to expect\r\nanything from _his_ enemies, but such insolence, never! Is he alive?\" she\r\nshrieked in a frenzy, turning upon Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch. \"Have you\r\nkilled him? Confess!\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom do you take me for?\" he cried, jumping up from his chair with\r\na distorted face; but it was not easy now to frighten her. She was\r\ntriumphant.\r\n\r\n\"Who can tell who you are and where you've sprung from? Only my heart,\r\nmy heart had misgivings all these five years, of all the intrigues.","And\r\nI've been sitting here wondering what blind owl was making up to me? No,\r\nmy dear, you're a poor actor, worse than Lebyadkin even. Give my humble\r\ngreetings to the countess and tell her to send someone better than you.\r\nHas she hired you, tell me? Have they given you a place in her kitchen\r\nout of charity? I see through your deception. I understand you all,\r\nevery one of you.\"\r\n\r\nHe seized her firmly above the elbow; she laughed in his face.","\"You're like him, very like, perhaps you're a relation--you're a sly\r\nlot! Only mine is a bright falcon and a prince, and you're an owl, and\r\na shopman! Mine will bow down to God if it pleases him, and won't if it\r\ndoesn't. And Shatushka (he's my dear, my darling!) slapped you on the\r\ncheeks, my Lebyadkin told me. And what were you afraid of then, when you\r\ncame in? Who had frightened you then? When I saw your mean face after\r\nI'd fallen down and you picked me up--it was like a worm crawling into\r\nmy heart.","It's not he, I thought, not _he!_ My falcon would never have\r\nbeen ashamed of me before a fashionable young lady. Oh heavens! That\r\nalone kept me happy for those five years that my falcon was living\r\nsomewhere beyond the mountains, soaring, gazing at the sun.... Tell\r\nme, you impostor, have you got much by it? Did you need a big bribe to\r\nconsent? I wouldn't have given you a farthing. Ha ha ha! Ha ha!.","..\"\r\n\r\n\"Ugh, idiot!\" snarled Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, still holding her tight\r\nby the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Go away, impostor!\" she shouted peremptorily. \"I'm the wife of my\r\nprince; I'm not afraid of your knife!\"\r\n\r\n\"Knife!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, knife, you've a knife in your pocket. You thought I was asleep but\r\nI saw it. When you came in just now you took out your knife!\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you saying, unhappy creature? What dreams you have!\" he\r\nexclaimed, pushing her away from him with all his might, so that her\r\nhead and shoulders fell painfully against the sofa.","He was rushing away;\r\nbut she at once flew to overtake him, limping and hopping, and though\r\nLebyadkin, panic-stricken, held her back with all his might, she\r\nsucceeded in shouting after him into the darkness, shrieking and\r\nlaughing:\r\n\r\n\"A curse on you, Grishka Otrepyev!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\"A knife, a knife,\" he repeated with uncontrollable anger, striding\r\nalong through the mud and puddles, without picking his way.","It is true\r\nthat at moments he had a terrible desire to laugh aloud frantically; but\r\nfor some reason he controlled himself and restrained his laughter. He\r\nrecovered himself only on the bridge, on the spot where Fedka had met\r\nhim that evening. He found the man lying in wait for him again. Seeing\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch he took off his cap, grinned gaily, and\r\nbegan babbling briskly and merrily about something.","At first Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch walked on without stopping, and for some time did not\r\neven listen to the tramp who was pestering him again. He was suddenly\r\nstruck by the thought that he had entirely forgotten him, and had\r\nforgotten him at the very moment when he himself was repeating, \"A\r\nknife, a knife.\" He seized the tramp by the collar and gave vent to\r\nhis pent-up rage by flinging him violently against the bridge.","For one\r\ninstant the man thought of fighting, but almost at once realising that\r\ncompared with his adversary, who had fallen upon him unawares, he was\r\nno better than a wisp of straw, he subsided and was silent, without\r\noffering any resistance. Crouching on the ground with his elbows crooked\r\nbehind his back, the wily tramp calmly waited for what would happen\r\nnext, apparently quite incredulous of danger.","He was right in his\r\nreckoning. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had already with his left hand taken\r\noff his thick scarf to tie his prisoner's arms, but suddenly, for some\r\nreason, he abandoned him, and shoved him away. The man instantly sprang\r\non to his feet, turned round, and a short, broad boot-knife suddenly\r\ngleamed in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Away with that knife; put it away, at once!\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch\r\ncommanded with an impatient gesture, and the knife vanished as\r\ninstantaneously as it had appeared.","Without speaking again or turning round, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch went on\r\nhis way. But the persistent vagabond did not leave him even now, though\r\nnow, it is true, he did not chatter, and even respectfully kept his\r\ndistance, a full step behind.\r\n\r\nThey crossed the bridge like this and came out on to the river bank,\r\nturning this time to the left, again into a long deserted back street,\r\nwhich led to the centre of the town by a shorter way than going through\r\nBogoyavlensky Street.","\"Is it true, as they say, that you robbed a church in the district the\r\nother day?\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"I went in to say my prayers in the first place,\" the tramp answered,\r\nsedately and respectfully as though nothing had happened; more than\r\nsedately, in fact, almost with dignity. There was no trace of his\r\nformer \"friendly\" familiarity. All that was to be seen was a serious,\r\nbusiness-like man, who had indeed been gratuitously insulted, but who\r\nwas capable of overlooking an insult.","\"But when the Lord led me there,\" he went on, \"ech, I thought what a\r\nheavenly abundance! It was all owing to my helpless state, as in our\r\nway of life there's no doing without assistance. And, now, God be my\r\nwitness, sir, it was my own loss. The Lord punished me for my sins, and\r\nwhat with the censer and the deacon's halter, I only got twelve roubles\r\naltogether. The chin setting of St. Nikolay of pure silver went for next\r\nto nothing.","They said it was plated.\"\r\n\r\n\"You killed the watchman?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is, I cleared the place out together with that watchman, but\r\nafterwards, next morning, by the river, we fell to quarrelling which\r\nshould carry the sack. I sinned, I did lighten his load for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you can rob and murder again.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the very advice Pyotr Stepanovitch gives me, in the very\r\nsame words, for he's uncommonly mean and hard-hearted about helping a\r\nfellow-creature.","And what's more, he hasn't a ha'p'orth of belief in the\r\nHeavenly Creator, who made us out of earthly clay; but he says it's all\r\nthe work of nature even to the last beast. He doesn't understand either\r\nthat with our way of life it's impossible for us to get along without\r\nfriendly assistance. If you begin to talk to him he looks like a\r\nsheep at the water; it makes one wonder. Would you believe, at Captain\r\nLebyadkin's, out yonder, whom your honour's just been visiting, when he\r\nwas living at Filipov's, before you came, the door stood open all night\r\nlong.","He'd be drunk and sleeping like the dead, and his money dropping\r\nout of his pockets all over the floor. I've chanced to see it with\r\nmy own eyes, for in our way of life it's impossible to live without\r\nassistance....\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you mean with your own eyes? Did you go in at night then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe I did go in, but no one knows of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you kill him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Reckoning it out, I steadied myself.","For once having learned for sure\r\nthat I can always get one hundred and fifty roubles, why should I go so\r\nfar when I can get fifteen hundred roubles, if I only bide my time. For\r\nCaptain Lebyadkin (I've heard him with my own ears) had great hopes of\r\nyou when he was drunk; and there isn't a tavern here--not the lowest\r\npot-house--where he hasn't talked about it when he was in that state.\r\nSo that hearing it from many lips, I began, too, to rest all my hopes\r\non your excellency.","I speak to you, sir, as to my father, or my own\r\nbrother; for Pyotr Stepanovitch will never learn that from me, and not\r\na soul in the world. So won't your excellency spare me three roubles in\r\nyour kindness? You might set my mind at rest, so that I might know the\r\nreal truth; for we can't get on without assistance.\"\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch laughed aloud, and taking out his purse, in\r\nwhich he had as much as fifty roubles, in small notes, threw him one\r\nnote out of the bundle, then a second, a third, a fourth.","Fedka flew to\r\ncatch them in the air. The notes dropped into the mud, and he snatched\r\nthem up crying, \"Ech! ech!\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch finished by flinging\r\nthe whole bundle at him, and, still laughing, went on down the street,\r\nthis time alone. The tramp remained crawling on his knees in the mud,\r\nlooking for the notes which were blown about by the wind and soaking in\r\nthe puddles, and for an hour after his spasmodic cries of \"Ech! ech!\"\r\nwere still to be heard in the darkness.","CHAPTER III. THE DUEL\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE NEXT DAY, at two o'clock in the afternoon, the duel took place as\r\narranged. Things were hastened forward by Gaganov's obstinate desire to\r\nfight at all costs. He did not understand his adversary's conduct,\r\nand was in a fury. For a whole month he had been insulting him with\r\nimpunity, and had so far been unable to make him lose patience. What he\r\nwanted was a challenge on the part of Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, as he had\r\nnot himself any direct pretext for challenging him.","His secret motive\r\nfor it, that is, his almost morbid hatred of Stavrogin for the insult to\r\nhis family four years before, he was for some reason ashamed to confess.\r\nAnd indeed he regarded this himself as an impossible pretext for a\r\nchallenge, especially in view of the humble apology offered by Nikolay\r\nStavrogin twice already. He privately made up his mind that Stavrogin\r\nwas a shameless coward; and could not understand how he could have\r\naccepted Shatov's blow.","So he made up his mind at last to send him\r\nthe extraordinarily rude letter that had finally roused Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch himself to propose a meeting. Having dispatched this\r\nletter the day before, he awaited a challenge with feverish impatience,\r\nand while morbidly reckoning the chances at one moment with hope and\r\nat the next with despair, he got ready for any emergency by securing a\r\nsecond, to wit, Mavriky Nikolaevitch Drozdov, who was a friend of his,\r\nan old schoolfellow, a man for whom he had a great respect.","So when\r\nKirillov came next morning at nine o'clock with his message he found\r\nthings in readiness. All the apologies and unheard-of condescension of\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch were at once, at the first word, rejected with\r\nextraordinary exasperation. Mavriky Nikolaevitch, who had only been made\r\nacquainted with the position of affairs the evening before, opened his\r\nmouth with surprise at such incredible concessions, and would have urged\r\na reconciliation, but seeing that Gaganov, guessing his intention, was\r\nalmost trembling in his chair, refrained, and said nothing.","If it had\r\nnot been for the promise given to his old schoolfellow he would have\r\nretired immediately; he only remained in the hope of being some help on\r\nthe scene of action. Kirillov repeated the challenge. All the conditions\r\nof the encounter made by Stavrogin were accepted on the spot, without\r\nthe faintest objection. Only one addition was made, and that a ferocious\r\none. If the first shots had no decisive effect, they were to fire again,\r\nand if the second encounter were inconclusive, it was to be followed by\r\na third.","Kirillov frowned, objected to the third encounter, but gaining\r\nnothing by his efforts agreed on the condition, however, that three\r\nshould be the limit, and that \"a fourth encounter was out of the\r\nquestion.\" This was conceded. Accordingly at two o'clock in the\r\nafternoon the meeting took place at Brykov, that is, in a little\r\ncopse in the outskirts of the town, lying between Skvoreshniki and the\r\nShpigulin factory.","The rain of the previous night was over, but it was\r\ndamp, grey, and windy. Low, ragged, dingy clouds moved rapidly across\r\nthe cold sky. The tree-tops roared with a deep droning sound, and\r\ncreaked on their roots; it was a melancholy morning.\r\n\r\nMavriky Nikolaevitch and Gaganov arrived on the spot in a smart\r\nchar-√†-banc with a pair of horses driven by the latter. They were\r\naccompanied by a groom.","Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch and Kirillov arrived\r\nalmost at the same instant. They were not driving, they were on\r\nhorseback, and were also followed by a mounted servant. Kirillov, who\r\nhad never mounted a horse before, sat up boldly, erect in the saddle,\r\ngrasping in his right hand the heavy box of pistols which he would not\r\nentrust to the servant. In his inexperience he was continually with his\r\nleft hand tugging at the reins, which made the horse toss his head and\r\nshow an inclination to rear.","This, however, seemed to cause his rider no\r\nuneasiness. Gaganov, who was morbidly suspicious and always ready to be\r\ndeeply offended, considered their coming on horseback as a fresh insult\r\nto himself, inasmuch as it showed that his opponents were too confident\r\nof success, since they had not even thought it necessary to have a\r\ncarriage in case of being wounded and disabled. He got out of his\r\nchar-√†-banc, yellow with anger, and felt that his hands were trembling,\r\nas he told Mavriky Nikolaevitch.","He made no response at all to Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch's bow, and turned away. The seconds cast lots. The lot\r\nfell on Kirillov's pistols. They measured out the barrier and placed the\r\ncombatants. The servants with the carriage and horses were moved\r\nback three hundred paces. The weapons were loaded and handed to the\r\ncombatants.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry that I have to tell my story more quickly and have no time\r\nfor descriptions.","But I can't refrain from some comments. Mavriky\r\nNikolaevitch was melancholy and preoccupied. Kirillov, on the other\r\nhand, was perfectly calm and unconcerned, very exact over the details\r\nof the duties he had undertaken, but without the slightest fussiness or\r\neven curiosity as to the issue of the fateful contest that was so near\r\nat hand. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was paler than usual. He was rather\r\nlightly dressed in an overcoat and a white beaver hat.","He seemed very\r\ntired, he frowned from time to time, and seemed to feel it superfluous\r\nto conceal his ill-humour. But Gaganov was at this moment more worthy\r\nof mention than anyone, so that it is quite impossible not to say a few\r\nwords about him in particular.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nI have hitherto not had occasion to describe his appearance. He was a\r\ntall man of thirty-three, and well fed, as the common folk express it,\r\nalmost fat, with lank flaxen hair, and with features which might be\r\ncalled handsome.","He had retired from the service with the rank of\r\ncolonel, and if he had served till he reached the rank of general he\r\nwould have been even more impressive in that position, and would very\r\nlikely have become an excellent fighting general.\r\n\r\nI must add, as characteristic of the man, that the chief cause of\r\nhis leaving the army was the thought of the family disgrace which had\r\nhaunted him so painfully since the insult paid to his father by Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch four years before at the club.","He conscientiously\r\nconsidered it dishonourable to remain in the service, and was inwardly\r\npersuaded that he was contaminating the regiment and his companions,\r\nalthough they knew nothing of the incident. It's true that he had once\r\nbefore been disposed to leave the army long before the insult to his\r\nfather, and on quite other grounds, but he had hesitated. Strange as it\r\nis to write, the original design, or rather desire, to leave the army\r\nwas due to the proclamation of the 19th of February of the emancipation\r\nof the serfs.","Gaganov, who was one of the richest landowners in the\r\nprovince, and who had not lost very much by the emancipation, and was,\r\nmoreover, quite capable of understanding the humanity of the reform and\r\nits economic advantages, suddenly felt himself personally insulted by\r\nthe proclamation. It was something unconscious, a feeling; but was\r\nall the stronger for being unrecognised. He could not bring himself,\r\nhowever, to take any decisive step till his father's death.","But he began\r\nto be well known for his \"gentlemanly\" ideas to many persons of high\r\nposition in Petersburg, with whom he strenuously kept up connections. He\r\nwas secretive and self-contained. Another characteristic: he belonged to\r\nthat strange section of the nobility, still surviving in Russia, who\r\nset an extreme value on their pure and ancient lineage, and take it too\r\nseriously. At the same time he could not endure Russian history, and,\r\nindeed, looked upon Russian customs in general as more or less piggish.","Even in his childhood, in the special military school for the sons of\r\nparticularly wealthy and distinguished families in which he had the\r\nprivilege of being educated, from first to last certain poetic notions\r\nwere deeply rooted in his mind. He loved castles, chivalry; all the\r\ntheatrical part of it. He was ready to cry with shame that in the days\r\nof the Moscow Tsars the sovereign had the right to inflict corporal\r\npunishment on the Russian boyars, and blushed at the contrast.","This\r\nstiff and extremely severe man, who had a remarkable knowledge of\r\nmilitary science and performed his duties admirably, was at heart a\r\ndreamer. It was said that he could speak at meetings and had the gift of\r\nlanguage, but at no time during the thirty-three years of his life had\r\nhe spoken. Even in the distinguished circles in Petersburg, in which\r\nhe had moved of late, he behaved with extraordinary haughtiness.","His meeting in Petersburg with Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, who had just\r\nreturned from abroad, almost sent him out of his mind. At the present\r\nmoment, standing at the barrier, he was terribly uneasy. He kept\r\nimagining that the duel would somehow not come off; the least delay\r\nthrew him into a tremor. There was an expression of anguish in his face\r\nwhen Kirillov, instead of giving the signal for them to fire, began\r\nsuddenly speaking, only for form, indeed, as he himself explained aloud.","\"Simply as a formality, now that you have the pistols in your hands,\r\nand I must give the signal, I ask you for the last time, will you not be\r\nreconciled? It's the duty of a second.\"\r\n\r\nAs though to spite him, Mavriky Nikolaevitch, who had till then kept\r\nsilence, although he had been reproaching himself all day for his\r\ncompliance and acquiescence, suddenly caught up Kirillov's thought and\r\nbegan to speak:\r\n\r\n\"I entirely agree with Mr.","Kirillov's words.... This idea that\r\nreconciliation is impossible at the barrier is a prejudice, only\r\nsuitable for Frenchmen. Besides, with your leave, I don't understand\r\nwhat the offence is. I've been wanting to say so for a long time...\r\nbecause every apology is offered, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\nHe flushed all over. He had rarely spoken so much, and with such\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\"I repeat again my offer to make every possible apology,\" Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch interposed hurriedly.","\"This is impossible,\" shouted Gaganov furiously, addressing Mavriky\r\nNikolaevitch, and stamping with rage. \"Explain to this man,\" he pointed\r\nwith his pistol at Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, \"if you're my second and not\r\nmy enemy, Mavriky Nikolaevitch, that such overtures only aggravate the\r\ninsult. He feels it impossible to be insulted by me!... He feels it no\r\ndisgrace to walk away from me at the barrier! What does he take me for,\r\nafter that, do you think?.",".. And you, you, my second, too! You're simply\r\nirritating me that I may miss.\"\r\n\r\nHe stamped again. There were flecks of foam on his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Negotiations are over. I beg you to listen to the signal!\" Kirillov\r\nshouted at the top of his voice. \"One! Two! Three!\"\r\n\r\nAt the word \"Three\" the combatants took aim at one another. Gaganov at\r\nonce raised his pistol, and at the fifth or sixth step he fired.","For a\r\nsecond he stood still, and, making sure that he had missed, advanced to\r\nthe barrier. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch advanced too, raising his pistol,\r\nbut somehow holding it very high, and fired, almost without taking aim.\r\nThen he took out his handkerchief and bound it round the little finger\r\nof his right hand. Only then they saw that Gaganov had not missed him\r\ncompletely, but the bullet had only grazed the fleshy part of his finger\r\nwithout touching the bone; it was only a slight scratch.","Kirillov at\r\nonce announced that the duel would go on, unless the combatants were\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n\"I declare,\" said Gaganov hoarsely (his throat felt parched), again\r\naddressing Mavriky Nikolaevitch, \"that this man,\" again he pointed\r\nin Stavrogin's direction, \"fired in the air on purpose...\r\nintentionally.... This is an insult again.... He wants to make the\r\nduel impossible!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have the right to fire as I like so long as I keep the rules,\"\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch asserted resolutely.","\"No, he hasn't! Explain it to him! Explain it!\" cried Gaganov.\r\n\r\n\"I'm in complete agreement with Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch,\" proclaimed\r\nKirillov.\r\n\r\n\"Why does he spare me?\" Gaganov raged, not hearing him. \"I despise his\r\nmercy.... I spit on it.... I...\"\r\n\r\n\"I give you my word that I did not intend to insult you,\" cried Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch impatiently. \"I shot high because I don't want to kill\r\nanyone else, either you or anyone else.","It's nothing to do with you\r\npersonally. It's true that I don't consider myself insulted, and I'm\r\nsorry that angers you. But I don't allow any one to interfere with my\r\nrights.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he's so afraid of bloodshed, ask him why he challenged me,\" yelled\r\nGaganov, still addressing Mavriky Nikolaevitch.\r\n\r\n\"How could he help challenging you?\" said Kirillov, intervening. \"You\r\nwouldn't listen to anything.","How was one to get rid of you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll only mention one thing,\" observed Mavriky Nikolaevitch, pondering\r\nthe matter with painful effort. \"If a combatant declares beforehand that\r\nhe will fire in the air the duel certainly cannot go on... for obvious\r\nand... delicate reasons.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't declared that I'll fire in the air every time,\" cried\r\nStavrogin, losing all patience. \"You don't know what's in my mind or how\r\nI intend to fire again.","... I'm not restricting the duel at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case the encounter can go on,\" said Mavriky Nikolaevitch to\r\nGaganov.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, take your places,\" Kirillov commanded. Again they advanced,\r\nagain Gaganov missed and Stavrogin fired into the air. There might have\r\nbeen a dispute as to his firing into the air. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch\r\nmight have flatly declared that he'd fired properly, if he had not\r\nadmitted that he had missed intentionally.","He did not aim straight at\r\nthe sky or at the trees, but seemed to aim at his adversary, though as\r\nhe pointed the pistol the bullet flew a yard above his hat. The second\r\ntime the shot was even lower, even less like an intentional miss.\r\nNothing would have convinced Gaganov now.\r\n\r\n\"Again!\" he muttered, grinding his teeth. \"No matter! I've been\r\nchallenged and I'll make use of my rights. I'll fire a third time.","..\r\nwhatever happens.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have full right to do so,\" Kirillov rapped out. Mavriky\r\nNikolaevitch said nothing. The opponents were placed a third time, the\r\nsignal was given. This time Gaganov went right up to the barrier, and\r\nbegan from there taking aim, at a distance of twelve paces. His hand\r\nwas trembling too much to take good aim. Stavrogin stood with his pistol\r\nlowered and awaited his shot without moving.","\"Too long; you've been aiming too long!\" Kirillov shouted impetuously.\r\n\"Fire! Fire!\"\r\n\r\nBut the shot rang out, and this time Stavrogin's white beaver hat flew\r\noff. The aim had been fairly correct. The crown of the hat was pierced\r\nvery low down; a quarter of an inch lower and all would have been over.\r\nKirillov picked up the hat and handed it to Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch.\r\n\r\n\"Fire; don't detain your adversary!\" cried Mavriky Nikolaevitch in\r\nextreme agitation, seeing that Stavrogin seemed to have forgotten to\r\nfire, and was examining the hat with Kirillov.","Stavrogin started, looked\r\nat Gaganov, turned round and this time, without the slightest regard for\r\npunctilio, fired to one side, into the copse. The duel was over. Gaganov\r\nstood as though overwhelmed. Mavriky Nikolaevitch went up and began\r\nsaying something to him, but he did not seem to understand. Kirillov\r\ntook off his hat as he went away, and nodded to Mavriky Nikolaevitch.\r\nBut Stavrogin forgot his former politeness.","When he had shot into the\r\ncopse he did not even turn towards the barrier. He handed his pistol to\r\nKirillov and hastened towards the horses. His face looked angry; he did\r\nnot speak. Kirillov, too, was silent. They got on their horses and set\r\noff at a gallop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you speak?\" he called impatiently to Kirillov, when they were\r\nnot far from home.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" replied the latter, almost slipping off his horse,\r\nwhich was rearing.","Stavrogin restrained himself.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mean to insult that... fool, and I've insulted him again,\" he\r\nsaid quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you've insulted him again,\" Kirillov jerked out, \"and besides,\r\nhe's not a fool.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've done all I can, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"What ought I to have done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not have challenged him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Accept another blow in the face?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, accept another.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't understand anything now,\" said Stavrogin wrathfully.","\"Why does\r\nevery one expect of me something not expected from anyone else? Why am\r\nI to put up with what no one else puts up with, and undertake burdens no\r\none else can bear?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were seeking a burden yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I seek a burden?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've... seen that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it so noticeable?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment. Stavrogin had a very preoccupied face.","He was almost impressed.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't aim because I didn't want to kill anyone. There was nothing\r\nmore in it, I assure you,\" he said hurriedly, and with agitation, as\r\nthough justifying himself.\r\n\r\n\"You ought not to have offended him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What ought I to have done then?\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought to have killed him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sorry I didn't kill him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sorry for anything. I thought you really meant to kill him.","You\r\ndon't know what you're seeking.\"\r\n\r\n\"I seek a burden,\" laughed Stavrogin.\r\n\r\n\"If you didn't want blood yourself, why did you give him a chance to\r\nkill you?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I hadn't challenged him, he'd have killed me simply, without a\r\nduel.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not your affair. Perhaps he wouldn't have killed you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only have beaten me?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not your business. Bear your burden. Or else there's no merit.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Hang your merit. I don't seek anyone's approbation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were seeking it,\" Kirillov commented with terrible\r\nunconcern.\r\n\r\nThey rode into the courtyard of the house.\r\n\r\n\"Do you care to come in?\" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch.\r\n\r\n\"No; I'm going home. Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nHe got off the horse and took his box of pistols under his arm.\r\n\r\n\"Anyway, you're not angry with me?\" said Stavrogin, holding out his hand\r\nto him.","\"Not in the least,\" said Kirillov, turning round to shake hands with\r\nhim. \"If my burden's light it's because it's from nature; perhaps your\r\nburden's heavier because that's your nature. There's no need to be much\r\nashamed; only a little.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know I'm a worthless character, and I don't pretend to be a strong\r\none.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better not; you're not a strong person. Come and have tea.\"\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch went into the house, greatly perturbed.","IV\r\n\r\nHe learned at once from Alexey Yegorytch that Varvara Petrovna had\r\nbeen very glad to hear that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had gone out for a\r\nride--the first time he had left the house after eight days' illness.\r\nShe had ordered the carriage, and had driven out alone for a breath of\r\nfresh air \"according to the habit of the past, as she had forgotten for\r\nthe last eight days what it meant to breathe fresh air.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Alone, or with Darya Pavlovna?\" Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch interrupted the\r\nold man with a rapid question, and he scowled when he heard that Darya\r\nPavlovna \"had declined to go abroad on account of indisposition and was\r\nin her rooms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, old man,\" he said, as though suddenly making up his mind. \"Keep\r\nwatch over her all to-day, and if you notice her coming to me, stop her\r\nat once, and tell her that I can't see her for a few days at least.","..\r\nthat I ask her not to come myself.... I'll let her know myself, when the\r\ntime comes. Do you hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell her, sir,\" said Alexey Yegorytch, with distress in his voice,\r\ndropping his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Not till you see clearly she's meaning to come and see me of herself,\r\nthough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be afraid, sir, there shall be no mistake. Your interviews have\r\nall passed through me, hitherto. You've always turned to me for help.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. Not till she comes of herself, anyway. Bring me some tea, if\r\nyou can, at once.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man had hardly gone out, when almost at the same instant the\r\ndoor reopened, and Darya Pavlovna appeared in the doorway. Her eyes were\r\ntranquil, though her face was pale.\r\n\r\n\"Where have you come from?\" exclaimed Stavrogin.\r\n\r\n\"I was standing there, and waiting for him to go out, to come in to\r\nyou.","I heard the order you gave him, and when he came out just now I hid\r\nround the corner, on the right, and he didn't notice me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've long meant to break off with you, Dasha... for a while... for the\r\npresent. I couldn't see you last night, in spite of your note. I meant\r\nto write to you myself, but I don't know how to write,\" he added with\r\nvexation, almost as though with disgust.\r\n\r\n\"I thought myself that we must break it off.","Varvara Petrovna is too\r\nsuspicious of our relations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let her be.\"\r\n\r\n\"She mustn't be worried. So now we part till the end comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You still insist on expecting the end?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm sure of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But nothing in the world ever has an end.\"\r\n\r\n\"This will have an end. Then call me. I'll come. Now, good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what sort of end will it be?\" smiled Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch.\r\n\r\n\"You're not wounded, and.",".. have not shed blood?\" she asked, not\r\nanswering his question.\r\n\r\n\"It was stupid. I didn't kill anyone. Don't be uneasy. However, you'll\r\nhear all about it to-day from every one. I'm not quite well.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going. The announcement of the marriage won't be to-day?\" she added\r\nirresolutely.\r\n\r\n\"It won't be to-day, and it won't be to-morrow. I can't say about the\r\nday after to-morrow. Perhaps we shall all be dead, and so much the\r\nbetter.","Leave me alone, leave me alone, do.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't ruin that other... mad girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't ruin either of the mad creatures. It seems to be the sane I'm\r\nruining. I'm so vile and loathsome, Dasha, that I might really send for\r\nyou, 'at the latter end,' as you say. And in spite of your sanity you'll\r\ncome. Why will you be your own ruin?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that at the end I shall be the only one left you, and.",".. I'm\r\nwaiting for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what if I don't send for you after all, but run away from you?\"\r\n\r\n\"That can't be. You will send for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a great deal of contempt for me in that.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know that there's not only contempt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then there is contempt, anyway?\"\r\n\r\n\"I used the wrong word. God is my witness, it's my greatest wish that\r\nyou may never have need of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"One phrase is as good as another.","I should also have wished not to have\r\nruined you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can never, anyhow, be my ruin; and you know that yourself, better\r\nthan anyone,\" Darya Pavlovna said, rapidly and resolutely. \"If I don't\r\ncome to you I shall be a sister of mercy, a nurse, shall wait upon the\r\nsick, or go selling the gospel. I've made up my mind to that. I cannot\r\nbe anyone's wife. I can't live in a house like this, either.","That's not\r\nwhat I want.... You know all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I never could tell what you want. It seems to me that you're\r\ninterested in me, as some veteran nurses get specially interested in\r\nsome particular invalid in comparison with the others, or still more,\r\nlike some pious old women who frequent funerals and find one corpse more\r\nattractive than another. Why do you look at me so strangely?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you very ill?\" she asked sympathetically, looking at him in a\r\npeculiar way.","\"Good heavens! And this man wants to do without me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Dasha, now I'm always seeing phantoms. One devil offered me\r\nyesterday, on the bridge, to murder Lebyadkin and Marya Timofyevna, to\r\nsettle the marriage difficulty, and to cover up all traces. He asked me\r\nto give him three roubles on account, but gave me to understand that\r\nthe whole operation wouldn't cost less than fifteen hundred.","Wasn't he a\r\ncalculating devil! A regular shopkeeper. Ha ha!\"\r\n\r\n\"But you're fully convinced that it was an hallucination?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; not a bit an hallucination! It was simply Fedka the convict,\r\nthe robber who escaped from prison. But that's not the point. What do\r\nyou suppose I did! I gave him all I had, everything in my purse, and now\r\nhe's sure I've given him that on account!\"\r\n\r\n\"You met him at night, and he made such a suggestion? Surely you must\r\nsee that you're being caught in their nets on every side!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let them be.","But you've got some question at the tip of your\r\ntongue, you know. I see it by your eyes,\" he added with a resentful and\r\nirritable smile.\r\n\r\nDasha was frightened.\r\n\r\n\"I've no question at all, and no doubt whatever; you'd better be quiet!\"\r\nshe cried in dismay, as though waving off his question.\r\n\r\n\"Then you're convinced that I won't go to Fedka's little shop?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, God!\" she cried, clasping her hands.","\"Why do you torture me like\r\nthis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, forgive me my stupid joke. I must be picking up bad manners from\r\nthem. Do you know, ever since last night I feel awfully inclined to\r\nlaugh, to go on laughing continually forever so long. It's as though\r\nI must explode with laughter. It's like an illness.... Oh! my mother's\r\ncoming in. I always know by the rumble when her carriage has stopped at\r\nthe entrance.","\"\r\n\r\nDasha seized his hand.\r\n\r\n\"God save you from your demon, and... call me, call me quickly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! a fine demon! It's simply a little nasty, scrofulous imp, with a\r\ncold in his head, one of the unsuccessful ones. But you have something\r\nyou don't dare to say again, Dasha?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with pain and reproach, and turned towards the door.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" he called after her, with a malignant and distorted smile.","\"If... Yes, if, in one word, if... you understand, even if I did go to\r\nthat little shop, and if I called you after that--would you come then?\"\r\n\r\nShe went out, hiding her face in her hands, and neither turning nor\r\nanswering.\r\n\r\n\"She will come even after the shop,\" he whispered, thinking a moment,\r\nand an expression of scornful disdain came into his face. \"A nurse!\r\nH'm!... but perhaps that's what I want.","\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. ALL IN EXPECTATION\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe impression made on the whole neighbourhood by the story of the duel,\r\nwhich was rapidly noised abroad, was particularly remarkable from the\r\nunanimity with which every one hastened to take up the cudgels for\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch. Many of his former enemies declared themselves\r\nhis friends. The chief reason for this change of front in public opinion\r\nwas chiefly due to one person, who had hitherto not expressed her\r\nopinion, but who now very distinctly uttered a few words, which at\r\nonce gave the event a significance exceedingly interesting to the vast\r\nmajority.","This was how it happened. On the day after the duel, all the\r\ntown was assembled at the Marshal of Nobility's in honour of his wife's\r\nnameday. Yulia Mihailovna was present, or, rather, presided, accompanied\r\nby Lizaveta Nikolaevna, radiant with beauty and peculiar gaiety, which\r\nstruck many of our ladies at once as particularly suspicious at\r\nthis time. And I may mention, by the way, her engagement to Mavriky\r\nNikolaevitch was by now an established fact.","To a playful question from\r\na retired general of much consequence, of whom we shall have more to\r\nsay later, Lizaveta Nikolaevna frankly replied that evening that she was\r\nengaged. And only imagine, not one of our ladies would believe in her\r\nengagement. They all persisted in assuming a romance of some sort, some\r\nfatal family secret, something that had happened in Switzerland, and for\r\nsome reason imagined that Yulia Mihailovna must have had some hand in\r\nit.","It was difficult to understand why these rumours, or rather fancies,\r\npersisted so obstinately, and why Yulia Mihailovna was so positively\r\nconnected with it. As soon as she came in, all turned to her with\r\nstrange looks, brimful of expectation. It must be observed that owing to\r\nthe freshness of the event, and certain circumstances accompanying\r\nit, at the party people talked of it with some circumspection, in\r\nundertones.","Besides, nothing yet was known of the line taken by the\r\nauthorities. As far as was known, neither of the combatants had been\r\ntroubled by the police. Every one knew, for instance, that Gaganov had\r\nset off home early in the morning to Duhovo, without being hindered.\r\nMeanwhile, of course, all were eager for someone to be the first to\r\nspeak of it aloud, and so to open the door to the general impatience.","They rested their hopes on the general above-mentioned, and they were\r\nnot disappointed.\r\n\r\nThis general, a landowner, though not a wealthy one, was one of the most\r\nimposing members of our club, and a man of an absolutely unique turn of\r\nmind. He flirted in the old-fashioned way with the young ladies, and was\r\nparticularly fond, in large assemblies, of speaking aloud with all the\r\nweightiness of a general, on subjects to which others were alluding\r\nin discreet whispers.","This was, so to say, his special r√¥le in local\r\nsociety. He drawled, too, and spoke with peculiar suavity, probably\r\nhaving picked up the habit from Russians travelling abroad, or from\r\nthose wealthy landowners of former days who had suffered most from the\r\nemancipation. Stepan Trofimovitch had observed that the more completely\r\na landowner was ruined, the more suavely he lisped and drawled his\r\nwords.","He did, as a fact, lisp and drawl himself, but was not aware of\r\nit in himself.\r\n\r\nThe general spoke like a person of authority. He was, besides, a distant\r\nrelation of Gaganov's, though he was on bad terms with him, and even\r\nengaged in litigation with him. He had, moreover, in the past, fought\r\ntwo duels himself, and had even been degraded to the ranks and sent to\r\nthe Caucasus on account of one of them.","Some mention was made of Varvara\r\nPetrovna's having driven out that day and the day before, after being\r\nkept indoors \"by illness,\" though the allusion was not to her, but to\r\nthe marvellous matching of her four grey horses of the Stavrogins'\r\nown breeding. The general suddenly observed that he had met \"young\r\nStavrogin\" that day, on horseback.... Every one was instantly silent.\r\nThe general munched his lips, and suddenly proclaimed, twisting in his\r\nfingers his presentation gold snuff-box.","\"I'm sorry I wasn't here some years ago... I mean when I was at\r\nCarlsbad... H'm! I'm very much interested in that young man about whom\r\nI heard so many rumours at that time. H'm! And, I say, is it true that\r\nhe's mad? Some one told me so then. Suddenly I'm told that he has been\r\ninsulted by some student here, in the presence of his cousins, and he\r\nslipped under the table to get away from him.","And yesterday I heard\r\nfrom Stepan Vysotsky that Stavrogin had been fighting with Gaganov. And\r\nsimply with the gallant object of offering himself as a target to an\r\ninfuriated man, just to get rid of him. H'm! Quite in the style of the\r\nguards of the twenties. Is there any house where he visits here?\"\r\n\r\nThe general paused as though expecting an answer. A way had been opened\r\nfor the public impatience to express itself.","\"What could be simpler?\" cried Yulia Mihailovna, raising her voice,\r\nirritated that all present had turned their eyes upon her, as though\r\nat a word of command. \"Can one wonder that Stavrogin fought Gaganov and\r\ntook no notice of the student? He couldn't challenge a man who used to\r\nbe his serf!\"\r\n\r\nA noteworthy saying! A clear and simple notion, yet it had entered\r\nnobody's head till that moment.","It was a saying that had extraordinary\r\nconsequences. All scandal and gossip, all the petty tittle-tattle was\r\nthrown into the background, another significance had been detected. A\r\nnew character was revealed whom all had misjudged; a character, almost\r\nideally severe in his standards. Mortally insulted by a student, that\r\nis, an educated man, no longer a serf, he despised the affront because\r\nhis assailant had once been his serf.","Society had gossiped and slandered\r\nhim; shallow-minded people had looked with contempt on a man who had\r\nbeen struck in the face. He had despised a public opinion, which had not\r\nrisen to the level of the highest standards, though it discussed them.\r\n\r\n\"And, meantime, you and I, Ivan Alexandrovitch, sit and discuss the\r\ncorrect standards,\" one old club member observed to another, with a warm\r\nand generous glow of self-reproach.","\"Yes, Pyotr Mihailovitch, yes,\" the other chimed in with zest, \"talk of\r\nthe younger generation!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not a question of the younger generation,\" observed a third,\r\nputting in his spoke, \"it's nothing to do with the younger generation;\r\nhe's a star, not one of the younger generation; that's the way to look\r\nat it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it's just that sort we need; they're rare people.\" The chief\r\npoint in all this was that the \"new man,\" besides showing himself an\r\nunmistakable nobleman, was the wealthiest landowner in the province, and\r\nwas, therefore, bound to be a leading man who could be of assistance.","I've already alluded in passing to the attitude of the landowners of our\r\nprovince. People were enthusiastic:\r\n\r\n\"He didn't merely refrain from challenging the student. He put his hands\r\nbehind him, note that particularly, your excellency,\" somebody pointed\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\"And he didn't haul him up before the new law-courts, either,\" added\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\"In spite of the fact that for a personal insult to a nobleman he'd have\r\ngot fifteen roubles damages! He he he!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'll tell you a secret about the new courts,\" cried a third, in\r\na frenzy of excitement, \"if anyone's caught robbing or swindling and\r\nconvicted, he'd better run home while there's yet time, and murder his\r\nmother.","He'll be acquitted of everything at once, and ladies will wave\r\ntheir batiste handkerchiefs from the platform. It's the absolute truth!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the truth. It's the truth!\"\r\n\r\nThe inevitable anecdotes followed: Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch's friendly\r\nrelations with Count K. were recalled. Count K.'s stern and independent\r\nattitude to recent reforms was well known, as well as his remarkable\r\npublic activity, though that had somewhat fallen off of late.","And\r\nnow, suddenly, every one was positive that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was\r\nbetrothed to one of the count's daughters, though nothing had given\r\ngrounds for such a supposition. And as for some wonderful adventures in\r\nSwitzerland with Lizaveta Nikolaevna, even the ladies quite dropped all\r\nreference to it. I must mention, by the way, that the Drozdovs had by\r\nthis time succeeded in paying all the visits they had omitted at first.","Every one now confidently considered Lizaveta Nikolaevna a most ordinary\r\ngirl, who paraded her delicate nerves. Her fainting on the day of\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch's arrival was explained now as due to her\r\nterror at the student's outrageous behaviour. They even increased the\r\nprosaicness of that to which before they had striven to give such a\r\nfantastic colour. As for a lame woman who had been talked of, she was\r\nforgotten completely.","They were ashamed to remember her.\r\n\r\n\"And if there had been a hundred lame girls--we've all been young once!\"\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch's respectfulness to his mother was enlarged\r\nupon. Various virtues were discovered in him. People talked with\r\napprobation of the learning he had acquired in the four years he had\r\nspent in German universities. Gaganov's conduct was declared utterly\r\ntactless: \"not knowing friend from foe.","\" Yulia Mihailovna's keen insight\r\nwas unhesitatingly admitted.\r\n\r\nSo by the time Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch made his appearance among them\r\nhe was received by every one with na√Øve solemnity. In all eyes fastened\r\nupon him could be read eager anticipation. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch at\r\nonce wrapped himself in the most austere silence, which, of course,\r\ngratified every one much more than if he had talked till doomsday.","In a\r\nword, he was a success, he was the fashion. If once one has figured in\r\nprovincial society, there's no retreating into the background. Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch began to fulfil all his social duties in the province\r\npunctiliously as before. He was not found cheerful company: \"a man who\r\nhas seen suffering; a man not like other people; he has something to be\r\nmelancholy about.\" Even the pride and disdainful aloofness for which he\r\nhad been so detested four years before was now liked and respected.","Varvara Petrovna was triumphant. I don't know whether she grieved much\r\nover the shattering of her dreams concerning Lizaveta Nikolaevna. Family\r\npride, of course, helped her to get over it. One thing was strange:\r\nVarvara Petrovna was suddenly convinced that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch\r\nreally had \"made his choice\" at Count K.'s. And what was strangest of\r\nall, she was led to believe it by rumours which reached her on no\r\nbetter authority than other people.","She was afraid to ask Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch a direct question. Two or three times, however, she\r\ncould not refrain from slyly and good-humouredly reproaching him for not\r\nbeing open with her. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch smiled and remained silent.\r\nThe silence was taken as a sign of assent. And yet, all the time she\r\nnever forgot the cripple. The thought of her lay like a stone on her\r\nheart, a nightmare, she was tortured by strange misgivings and surmises,\r\nand all this at the same time as she dreamed of Count K.","'s daughters.\r\nBut of this we shall speak later. Varvara Petrovna began again, of\r\ncourse, to be treated with extreme deference and respect in society, but\r\nshe took little advantage of it and went out rarely.\r\n\r\nShe did, however, pay a visit of ceremony to the governor's wife. Of\r\ncourse, no one had been more charmed and delighted by Yulia Mihailovna's\r\nwords spoken at the marshal's soir√©e than she.","They lifted a load of\r\ncare off her heart, and had at once relieved much of the distress she\r\nhad been suffering since that luckless Sunday.\r\n\r\n\"I misunderstood that woman,\" she declared, and with her characteristic\r\nimpulsiveness she frankly told Yulia Mihailovna that she had come to\r\n_thank her_. Yulia Mihailovna was flattered, but she behaved with dignity.\r\nShe was beginning about this time to be very conscious of her own\r\nimportance, too much so, in fact.","She announced, for example, in the\r\ncourse of conversation, that she had never heard of Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nas a leading man or a savant.\r\n\r\n\"I know young Verhovensky, of course, and make much of him. He's\r\nimprudent, but then he's young; he's thoroughly well-informed, though.\r\nHe's not an out-of-date, old-fashioned critic, anyway.\" Varvara Petrovna\r\nhastened to observe that Stepan Trofimovitch had never been a critic,\r\nbut had, on the contrary, spent all his life in her house.","He was\r\nrenowned through circumstances of his early career, \"only too well known\r\nto the whole world,\" and of late for his researches in Spanish\r\nhistory. Now he intended to write also on the position of modern German\r\nuniversities, and, she believed, something about the Dresden Madonna\r\ntoo. In short, Varvara Petrovna refused to surrender Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nto the tender mercies of Yulia Mihailovna.","\"The Dresden Madonna? You mean the Sistine Madonna? _Ch√®re_ Varvara\r\nPetrovna, I spent two hours sitting before that picture and came away\r\nutterly disillusioned. I could make nothing of it and was in complete\r\namazement. Karmazinov, too, says it's hard to understand it. They all\r\nsee nothing in it now, Russians and English alike. All its fame is just\r\nthe talk of the last generation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fashions are changed then?\"\r\n\r\n\"What I think is that one mustn't despise our younger generation either.","They cry out that they're communists, but what I say is that we must\r\nappreciate them and mustn't be hard on them. I read everything now--the\r\npapers, communism, the natural sciences--I get everything because, after\r\nall, one must know where one's living and with whom one has to do. One\r\nmustn't spend one's whole life on the heights of one's own fancy. I've\r\ncome to the conclusion, and adopted it as a principle, that one must be\r\nkind to the young people and so keep them from the brink.","Believe me,\r\nVarvara Petrovna, that none but we who make up good society can by our\r\nkindness and good influence keep them from the abyss towards which they\r\nare brought by the intolerance of all these old men. I am glad though to\r\nlearn from you about Stepan Trofimovitch. You suggest an idea to me:\r\nhe may be useful at our literary matin√©e, you know I'm arranging for a\r\nwhole day of festivities, a subscription entertainment for the benefit\r\nof the poor governesses of our province.","They are scattered about\r\nRussia; in our district alone we can reckon up six of them. Besides\r\nthat, there are two girls in the telegraph office, two are being trained\r\nin the academy, the rest would like to be but have not the means. The\r\nRussian woman's fate is a terrible one, Varvara Petrovna! It's out of\r\nthat they're making the university question now, and there's even been a\r\nmeeting of the Imperial Council about it.","In this strange Russia of ours\r\none can do anything one likes; and that, again, is why it's only by the\r\nkindness and the direct warm sympathy of all the better classes that we\r\ncan direct this great common cause in the true path. Oh, heavens, have\r\nwe many noble personalities among us! There are some, of course, but\r\nthey are scattered far and wide. Let us unite and we shall be stronger.\r\nIn one word, I shall first have a literary matin√©e, then a light\r\nluncheon, then an interval, and in the evening a ball.","We meant to begin\r\nthe evening by living pictures, but it would involve a great deal\r\nof expense, and so, to please the public, there will be one or two\r\nquadrilles in masks and fancy dresses, representing well-known literary\r\nschools. This humorous idea was suggested by Karmazinov. He has been a\r\ngreat help to me. Do you know he's going to read us the last thing he's\r\nwritten, which no one has seen yet.","He is laying down the pen, and will\r\nwrite no more. This last essay is his farewell to the public. It's a\r\ncharming little thing called 'Merci.' The title is French; he thinks\r\nthat more amusing and even subtler. I do, too. In fact I advised it. I\r\nthink Stepan Trofimovitch might read us something too, if it were quite\r\nshort and... not so very learned. I believe Pyotr Stepanovitch and some\r\none else too will read something.","Pyotr Stepanovitch shall run round\r\nto you and tell you the programme. Better still, let me bring it to you\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to put my name down in your subscription list too. I'll tell\r\nStepan Trofimovitch and will beg him to consent.\"\r\n\r\nVarvara Petrovna returned home completely fascinated. She was ready\r\nto stand up for Yulia Mihailovna through thick and thin, and for some\r\nreason was already quite put out with Stepan Trofimovitch, while he,\r\npoor man, sat at home, all unconscious.","\"I'm in love with her. I can't understand how I could be so mistaken in\r\nthat woman,\" she said to Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch and Pyotr Stepanovitch,\r\nwho dropped in that evening.\r\n\r\n\"But you must make peace with the old man all the same,\" Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch submitted. \"He's in despair. You've quite sent him to\r\nCoventry. Yesterday he met your carriage and bowed, and you turned away.\r\nWe'll trot him out, you know; I'm reckoning on him for something, and he\r\nmay still be useful.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he'll read something.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean only that. And I was meaning to drop in on him to-day. So\r\nshall I tell him?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you like. I don't know, though, how you'll arrange it,\" she said\r\nirresolutely. \"I was meaning to have a talk with him myself, and wanted\r\nto fix the time and place.\"\r\n\r\nShe frowned.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's not worth while fixing a time. I'll simply give him the\r\nmessage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, do.","Add that I certainly will fix a time to see him though.\r\nBe sure to say that too.\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch ran off, grinning. He was, in fact, to the best of\r\nmy recollection, particularly spiteful all this time, and ventured upon\r\nextremely impatient sallies with almost every one. Strange to say, every\r\none, somehow, forgave him. It was generally accepted that he was not to\r\nbe looked at from the ordinary standpoint.","I may remark that he took up\r\nan extremely resentful attitude about Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch's duel.\r\nIt took him unawares. He turned positively green when he was told of it.\r\nPerhaps his vanity was wounded: he only heard of it next day when every\r\none knew of it.\r\n\r\n\"You had no right to fight, you know,\" he whispered to Stavrogin, five\r\ndays later, when he chanced to meet him at the club. It was remarkable\r\nthat they had not once met during those five days, though Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch had dropped in at Varvara Petrovna's almost every day.","Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch looked at him in silence with an absent-minded\r\nair, as though not understanding what was the matter, and he went on\r\nwithout stopping. He was crossing the big hall of the club on his way to\r\nthe refreshment room.\r\n\r\n\"You've been to see Shatov too.... You mean to make it known about Marya\r\nTimofyevna,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch muttered, running after him, and, as\r\nthough not thinking of what he was doing he clutched at his shoulder.","Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch shook his hand off and turned round quickly\r\nto him with a menacing scowl. Pyotr Stepanovitch looked at him with\r\na strange, prolonged smile. It all lasted only one moment. Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch walked on.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHe went to the \"old man\" straight from Varvara Petrovna's, and he was\r\nin such haste simply from spite, that he might revenge himself for an\r\ninsult of which I had no idea at that time.","The fact is that at\r\ntheir last interview on the Thursday of the previous week, Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch, though the dispute was one of his own beginning, had\r\nended by turning Pyotr Stepanovitch out with his stick. He concealed the\r\nincident from me at the time. But now, as soon as Pyotr Stepanovitch ran\r\nin with his everlasting grin, which was so na√Øvely condescending, and\r\nhis unpleasantly inquisitive eyes peering into every corner, Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch at once made a signal aside to me, not to leave the room.","This was how their real relations came to be exposed before me, for on\r\nthis occasion I heard their whole conversation.\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch was sitting stretched out on a lounge. He had grown\r\nthin and sallow since that Thursday. Pyotr Stepanovitch seated himself\r\nbeside him with a most familiar air, unceremoniously tucking his legs up\r\nunder him, and taking up more room on the lounge than deference to his\r\nfather should have allowed.","Stepan Trofimovitch moved aside, in silence,\r\nand with dignity.\r\n\r\nOn the table lay an open book. It was the novel, \"What's to be done?\"\r\nAlas, I must confess one strange weakness in my friend; the fantasy that\r\nhe ought to come forth from his solitude and fight a last battle was\r\ngetting more and more hold upon his deluded imagination. I guessed that\r\nhe had got the novel and was _studying_ it solely in order that when the\r\ninevitable conflict with the \"shriekers\" came about he might know their\r\nmethods and arguments beforehand, from their very \"catechism,\" and in\r\nthat way be prepared to confute them all triumphantly, _before her eyes.","_\r\nOh, how that book tortured him! He sometimes flung it aside in despair,\r\nand leaping up, paced about the room almost in a frenzy.\r\n\r\n\"I agree that the author's fundamental idea is a true one,\" he said to\r\nme feverishly, \"but that only makes it more awful. It's just our idea,\r\nexactly ours; we first sowed the seed, nurtured it, prepared the way,\r\nand, indeed, what could they say new, after us? But, heavens! How it's\r\nall expressed, distorted, mutilated!\" he exclaimed, tapping the book\r\nwith his fingers.","\"Were these the conclusions we were striving for? Who\r\ncan understand the original idea in this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Improving your mind?\" sniggered Pyotr Stepanovitch, taking the book\r\nfrom the table and reading the title. \"It's high time. I'll bring you\r\nbetter, if you like.\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch again preserved a dignified silence. I was sitting\r\non a sofa in the corner.\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch quickly explained the reason of his coming.","Of\r\ncourse, Stepan Trofimovitch was absolutely staggered, and he listened in\r\nalarm, which was mixed with extreme indignation.\r\n\r\n\"And that Yulia Mihailovna counts on my coming to read for her!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they're by no means in such need of you. On the contrary, it's by\r\nway of an attention to you, so as to make up to Varvara Petrovna. But,\r\nof course, you won't dare to refuse, and I expect you want to yourself,\"\r\nhe added with a grin.","\"You old fogies are all so devilishly ambitious.\r\nBut, I say though, you must look out that it's not too boring. What have\r\nyou got? Spanish history, or what is it? You'd better let me look at it\r\nthree days beforehand, or else you'll put us to sleep perhaps.\"\r\n\r\nThe hurried and too barefaced coarseness of these thrusts was obviously\r\npremeditated. He affected to behave as though it were impossible to talk\r\nto Stepan Trofimovitch in different and more delicate language.","Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch resolutely persisted in ignoring his insults, but what his\r\nson told him made a more and more overwhelming impression upon him.\r\n\r\n\"And she, she herself sent me this message through you?\" he asked,\r\nturning pale.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see, she means to fix a time and place for a mutual\r\nexplanation, the relics of your sentimentalising. You've been coquetting\r\nwith her for twenty years and have trained her to the most ridiculous\r\nhabits.","But don't trouble yourself, it's quite different now. She keeps\r\nsaying herself that she's only beginning now to 'have her eyes opened.'\r\nI told her in so many words that all this friendship of yours is nothing\r\nbut a mutual pouring forth of sloppiness. She told me lots, my boy. Foo!\r\nwhat a flunkey's place you've been filling all this time. I positively\r\nblushed for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I filling a flunkey's place?\" cried Stepan Trofimovitch, unable to\r\nrestrain himself.","\"Worse, you've been a parasite, that is, a voluntary flunkey too lazy to\r\nwork, while you've an appetite for money. She, too, understands all that\r\nnow. It's awful the things she's been telling me about you, anyway. I\r\ndid laugh, my boy, over your letters to her; shameful and disgusting.\r\nBut you're all so depraved, so depraved! There's always something\r\ndepraving in charity--you're a good example of it!\"\r\n\r\n\"She showed you my letters!\"\r\n\r\n\"All; though, of course, one couldn't read them all.","Foo, what a lot of\r\npaper you've covered! I believe there are more than two thousand letters\r\nthere. And do you know, old chap, I believe there was one moment when\r\nshe'd have been ready to marry you. You let slip your chance in the\r\nsilliest way. Of course, I'm speaking from your point of view, though,\r\nanyway, it would have been better than now when you've almost been\r\nmarried to 'cover another man's sins,' like a buffoon, for a jest, for\r\nmoney.","\"\r\n\r\n\"For money! She, she says it was for money!\" Stepan Trofimovitch wailed\r\nin anguish.\r\n\r\n\"What else, then? But, of course, I stood up for you. That's your only\r\nline of defence, you know. She sees for herself that you needed money\r\nlike every one else, and that from that point of view maybe you were\r\nright. I proved to her as clear as twice two makes four that it was a\r\nmutual bargain. She was a capitalist and you were a sentimental buffoon\r\nin her service.","She's not angry about the money, though you have milked\r\nher like a goat. She's only in a rage at having believed in you\r\nfor twenty years, at your having so taken her in over these noble\r\nsentiments, and made her tell lies for so long. She never will admit\r\nthat she told lies of herself, but you'll catch it the more for that. I\r\ncan't make out how it was you didn't see that you'd have to have a day\r\nof reckoning.","For after all you had some sense. I advised her yesterday\r\nto put you in an almshouse, a genteel one, don't disturb yourself;\r\nthere'll be nothing humiliating; I believe that's what she'll do. Do you\r\nremember your last letter to me, three weeks ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you have shown her that?\" cried Stepan Trofimovitch, leaping up in\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\n\"Rather! First thing. The one in which you told me she was exploiting\r\nyou, envious of your talent; oh, yes, and that about 'other men's sins.","'\r\nYou have got a conceit though, my boy! How I did laugh. As a rule your\r\nletters are very tedious. You write a horrible style. I often don't read\r\nthem at all, and I've one lying about to this day, unopened. I'll send\r\nit to you to-morrow. But that one, that last letter of yours was the\r\ntiptop of perfection! How I did laugh! Oh, how I laughed!\"\r\n\r\n\"Monster, monster!\" wailed Stepan Trofimovitch.\r\n\r\n\"Foo, damn it all, there's no talking to you.","I say, you're getting\r\nhuffy again as you were last Thursday.\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch drew himself up, menacingly.\r\n\r\n\"How dare you speak to me in such language?\"\r\n\r\n\"What language? It's simple and clear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, you monster, are you my son or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know that best. To be sure all fathers are disposed to be blind in\r\nsuch cases.\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence! Silence!\" cried Stepan Trofimovitch, shaking all over.","\"You see you're screaming and swearing at me as you did last Thursday.\r\nYou tried to lift your stick against me, but you know, I found that\r\ndocument. I was rummaging all the evening in my trunk from curiosity.\r\nIt's true there's nothing definite, you can take that comfort. It's only\r\na letter of my mother's to that Pole. But to judge from her\r\ncharacter...\"\r\n\r\n\"Another word and I'll box your ears.","\"\r\n\r\n\"What a set of people!\" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, suddenly addressing\r\nhimself to me. \"You see, this is how we've been ever since last\r\nThursday. I'm glad you're here this time, anyway, and can judge between\r\nus. To begin with, a fact: he reproaches me for speaking like this of my\r\nmother, but didn't he egg me on to it? In Petersburg before I left the\r\nHigh School, didn't he wake me twice in the night, to embrace me, and\r\ncry like a woman, and what do you suppose he talked to me about at night?\r\nWhy, the same modest anecdotes about my mother! It was from him I\r\nfirst heard them.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I meant that in a higher sense! Oh, you didn't understand me! You\r\nunderstood nothing, nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, anyway, it was meaner in you than in me, meaner, acknowledge that.\r\nYou see, it's nothing to me if you like. I'm speaking from your point\r\nof view. Don't worry about my point of view. I don't blame my mother; if\r\nit's you, then it's you, if it's a Pole, then it's a Pole, it's all the\r\nsame to me.","I'm not to blame because you and she managed so stupidly in\r\nBerlin. As though you could have managed things better. Aren't you an\r\nabsurd set, after that? And does it matter to you whether I'm your son\r\nor not? Listen,\" he went on, turning to me again, \"he's never spent a\r\npenny on me all his life; till I was sixteen he didn't know me at all;\r\nafterwards he robbed me here, and now he cries out that his heart has\r\nbeen aching over me all his life, and carries on before me like an\r\nactor.","I'm not Varvara Petrovna, mind you.\"\r\n\r\nHe got up and took his hat.\r\n\r\n\"I curse you henceforth!\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch, as pale as death, stretched out his hand above him.\r\n\r\n\"Ach, what folly a man will descend to!\" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch,\r\nactually surprised. \"Well, good-bye, old fellow, I shall never come and\r\nsee you again. Send me the article beforehand, don't forget, and try and\r\nlet it be free from nonsense.","Facts, facts, facts. And above all, let it\r\nbe short. Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nOutside influences, too, had come into play in the matter, however.\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch certainly had some designs on his parent. In my\r\nopinion he calculated upon reducing the old man to despair, and so to\r\ndriving him to some open scandal of a certain sort. This was to serve\r\nsome remote and quite other object of his own, of which I shall speak\r\nhereafter.","All sorts of plans and calculations of this kind were\r\nswarming in masses in his mind at that time, and almost all, of course,\r\nof a fantastic character. He had designs on another victim besides Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch. In fact, as appeared afterwards, his victims were not few\r\nin number, but this one he reckoned upon particularly, and it was Mr.\r\nvon Lembke himself.\r\n\r\nAndrey Antonovitch von Lembke belonged to that race, so favoured by\r\nnature, which is reckoned by hundreds of thousands at the Russian\r\ncensus, and is perhaps unconscious that it forms throughout its whole\r\nmass a strictly organised union.","And this union, of course, is not\r\nplanned and premeditated, but exists spontaneously in the whole race,\r\nwithout words or agreements as a moral obligation consisting in mutual\r\nsupport given by all members of the race to one another, at all times\r\nand places, and under all circumstances. Andrey Antonovitch had\r\nthe honour of being educated in one of those more exalted Russian\r\neducational institutions which are filled with the youth from families\r\nwell provided with wealth or connections.","Almost immediately on\r\nfinishing their studies the pupils were appointed to rather important\r\nposts in one of the government departments. Andrey Antonovitch had one\r\nuncle a colonel of engineers, and another a baker. But he managed to get\r\ninto this aristocratic school, and met many of his fellow-countrymen in\r\na similar position. He was a good-humoured companion, was rather stupid\r\nat his studies, but always popular.","And when many of his companions in\r\nthe upper forms--chiefly Russians--had already learnt to discuss the\r\nloftiest modern questions, and looked as though they were only\r\nwaiting to leave school to settle the affairs of the universe, Andrey\r\nAntonovitch was still absorbed in the most innocent schoolboy interests.\r\nHe amused them all, it is true, by his pranks, which were of a very\r\nsimple character, at the most a little coarse, but he made it his object\r\nto be funny.","At one time he would blow his nose in a wonderful way\r\nwhen the professor addressed a question to him, thereby making his\r\nschoolfellows and the professor laugh. Another time, in the dormitory,\r\nhe would act some indecent living picture, to the general applause,\r\nor he would play the overture to \"Fra Diavolo\" with his nose rather\r\nskilfully. He was distinguished, too, by intentional untidiness,\r\nthinking this, for some reason, witty.","In his very last year at school\r\nhe began writing Russian poetry.\r\n\r\nOf his native language he had only an ungrammatical knowledge, like many\r\nof his race in Russia. This turn for versifying drew him to a gloomy\r\nand depressed schoolfellow, the son of a poor Russian general, who was\r\nconsidered in the school to be a great future light in literature. The\r\nlatter patronised him. But it happened that three years after leaving\r\nschool this melancholy schoolfellow, who had flung up his official\r\ncareer for the sake of Russian literature, and was consequently going\r\nabout in torn boots, with his teeth chattering with cold, wearing a\r\nlight summer overcoat in the late autumn, met, one day on the Anitchin\r\nbridge, his former prot√©g√©, \"Lembka,\" as he always used to be called at\r\nschool.","And, what do you suppose? He did not at first recognise him,\r\nand stood still in surprise. Before him stood an irreproachably dressed\r\nyoung man with wonderfully well-kept whiskers of a reddish hue, with\r\npince-nez, with patent-leather boots, and the freshest of gloves, in a\r\nfull overcoat from Sharmer's, and with a portfolio under his arm. Lembke\r\nwas cordial to his old schoolfellow, gave him his address, and begged\r\nhim to come and see him some evening.","It appeared, too, that he was by\r\nnow not \"Lembka\" but \"Von Lembke.\" The schoolfellow came to see him,\r\nhowever, simply from malice perhaps. On the staircase, which was covered\r\nwith red felt and was rather ugly and by no means smart, he was met and\r\nquestioned by the house-porter. A bell rang loudly upstairs. But instead\r\nof the wealth which the visitor expected, he found Lembke in a\r\nvery little side-room, which had a dark and dilapidated appearance,\r\npartitioned into two by a large dark green curtain, and furnished with\r\nvery old though comfortable furniture, with dark green blinds on\r\nhigh narrow windows.","Von Lembke lodged in the house of a very distant\r\nrelation, a general who was his patron. He met his visitor cordially,\r\nwas serious and exquisitely polite. They talked of literature, too, but\r\nkept within the bounds of decorum. A manservant in a white tie brought\r\nthem some weak tea and little dry, round biscuits. The schoolfellow,\r\nfrom spite, asked for some seltzer water. It was given him, but after\r\nsome delays, and Lembke was somewhat embarrassed at having to summon the\r\nfootman a second time and give him orders.","But of himself he asked his\r\nvisitor whether he would like some supper, and was obviously relieved\r\nwhen he refused and went away. In short, Lembke was making his career,\r\nand was living in dependence on his fellow-countryman, the influential\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nHe was at that time sighing for the general's fifth daughter, and it\r\nseemed to him that his feeling was reciprocated. But Amalia was none the\r\nless married in due time to an elderly factory-owner, a German, and\r\nan old comrade of the general's.","Andrey Antonovitch did not shed many\r\ntears, but made a paper theatre. The curtain drew up, the actors came\r\nin, and gesticulated with their arms. There were spectators in the\r\nboxes, the orchestra moved their bows across their fiddles by machinery,\r\nthe conductor waved his baton, and in the stalls officers and dandies\r\nclapped their hands. It was all made of cardboard, it was all thought\r\nout and executed by Lembke himself.","He spent six months over this\r\ntheatre. The general arranged a friendly party on purpose. The theatre\r\nwas exhibited, all the general's five daughters, including the newly\r\nmarried Amalia with her factory-owner, numerous fraus and frauleins\r\nwith their men folk, attentively examined and admired the theatre, after\r\nwhich they danced. Lembke was much gratified and was quickly consoled.\r\n\r\nThe years passed by and his career was secured.","He always obtained good\r\nposts and always under chiefs of his own race; and he worked his way up\r\nat last to a very fine position for a man of his age. He had, for a long\r\ntime, been wishing to marry and looking about him carefully. Without\r\nthe knowledge of his superiors he had sent a novel to the editor of a\r\nmagazine, but it had not been accepted. On the other hand, he cut out\r\na complete toy railway, and again his creation was most successful.","Passengers came on to the platform with bags and portmanteaux, with dogs\r\nand children, and got into the carriages. The guards and porters moved\r\naway, the bell was rung, the signal was given, and the train started\r\noff. He was a whole year busy over this clever contrivance. But he had\r\nto get married all the same. The circle of his acquaintance was fairly\r\nwide, chiefly in the world of his compatriots, but his duties brought\r\nhim into Russian spheres also, of course.","Finally, when he was in his\r\nthirty-ninth year, he came in for a legacy. His uncle the baker died,\r\nand left him thirteen thousand roubles in his will. The one thing\r\nneedful was a suitable post. In spite of the rather elevated style of\r\nhis surroundings in the service, Mr. von Lembke was a very modest man.\r\nHe would have been perfectly satisfied with some independent little\r\ngovernment post, with the right to as much government timber as he\r\nliked, or something snug of that sort, and he would have been content\r\nall his life long.","But now, instead of the Minna or Ernestine he had\r\nexpected, Yulia Mihailovna suddenly appeared on the scene. His career\r\nwas instantly raised to a more elevated plane. The modest and precise\r\nman felt that he too was capable of ambition.\r\n\r\nYulia Mihailovna had a fortune of two hundred serfs, to reckon in the\r\nold style, and she had besides powerful friends. On the other hand\r\nLembke was handsome, and she was already over forty.","It is remarkable\r\nthat he fell genuinely in love with her by degrees as he became more\r\nused to being betrothed to her. On the morning of his wedding day he\r\nsent her a poem. She liked all this very much, even the poem; it's no\r\njoke to be forty. He was very quickly raised to a certain grade and\r\nreceived a certain order of distinction, and then was appointed governor\r\nof our province.\r\n\r\nBefore coming to us Yulia Mihailovna worked hard at moulding her\r\nhusband.","In her opinion he was not without abilities, he knew how to\r\nmake an entrance and to appear to advantage, he understood how to\r\nlisten and be silent with profundity, had acquired a quite distinguished\r\ndeportment, could make a speech, indeed had even some odds and ends of\r\nthought, and had caught the necessary gloss of modern liberalism. What\r\nworried her, however, was that he was not very open to new ideas, and\r\nafter the long, everlasting plodding for a career, was unmistakably\r\nbeginning to feel the need of repose.","She tried to infect him with her\r\nown ambition, and he suddenly began making a toy church: the pastor came\r\nout to preach the sermon, the congregation listened with their hands\r\nbefore them, one lady was drying her tears with her handkerchief, one\r\nold gentleman was blowing his nose; finally the organ pealed forth. It\r\nhad been ordered from Switzerland, and made expressly in spite of all\r\nexpense.","Yulia Mihailovna, in positive alarm, carried off the whole\r\nstructure as soon as she knew about it, and locked it up in a box in\r\nher own room. To make up for it she allowed him to write a novel on\r\ncondition of its being kept secret. From that time she began to reckon\r\nonly upon herself. Unhappily there was a good deal of shallowness and\r\nlack of judgment in her attitude. Destiny had kept her too long an old\r\nmaid.","Now one idea after another fluttered through her ambitious and\r\nrather over-excited brain. She cherished designs, she positively desired\r\nto rule the province, dreamed of becoming at once the centre of a\r\ncircle, adopted political sympathies. Von Lembke was actually a little\r\nalarmed, though, with his official tact, he quickly divined that he had\r\nno need at all to be uneasy about the government of the province itself.","The first two or three months passed indeed very satisfactorily. But now\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch had turned up, and something queer began to happen.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that young Verhovensky, from the first step, had displayed\r\na flagrant lack of respect for Andrey Antonovitch, and had assumed a\r\nstrange right to dictate to him; while Yulia Mihailovna, who had always\r\ntill then been so jealous of her husband's dignity, absolutely refused\r\nto notice it; or, at any rate, attached no consequence to it.","The young\r\nman became a favourite, ate, drank, and almost slept in the house. Von\r\nLembke tried to defend himself, called him \"young man\" before other\r\npeople, and slapped him patronisingly on the shoulder, but made no\r\nimpression. Pyotr Stepanovitch always seemed to be laughing in his face\r\neven when he appeared on the surface to be talking seriously to him, and\r\nhe would say the most startling things to him before company.","Returning\r\nhome one day he found the young man had installed himself in his study\r\nand was asleep on the sofa there, uninvited. He explained that he had\r\ncome in, and finding no one at home had \"had a good sleep.\"\r\n\r\nVon Lembke was offended and again complained to his wife. Laughing at\r\nhis irritability she observed tartly that he evidently did not know how\r\nto keep up his own dignity; and that with her, anyway, \"the boy\" had\r\nnever permitted himself any undue familiarity, \"he was na√Øve and fresh\r\nindeed, though not regardful of the conventions of society.","\" Von Lembke\r\nsulked. This time she made peace between them. Pyotr Stepanovitch did\r\nnot go so far as to apologise, but got out of it with a coarse jest,\r\nwhich might at another time have been taken for a fresh offence, but\r\nwas accepted on this occasion as a token of repentance. The weak spot\r\nin Andrey Antonovitch's position was that he had blundered in the first\r\ninstance by divulging the secret of his novel to him.","Imagining him\r\nto be an ardent young man of poetic feeling and having long dreamed\r\nof securing a listener, he had, during the early days of their\r\nacquaintance, on one occasion read aloud two chapters to him. The young\r\nman had listened without disguising his boredom, had rudely yawned,\r\nhad vouchsafed no word of praise; but on leaving had asked for the\r\nmanuscript that he might form an opinion of it at his leisure, and\r\nAndrey Antonovitch had given it him.","He had not returned the manuscript\r\nsince, though he dropped in every day, and had turned off all inquiries\r\nwith a laugh. Afterwards he declared that he had lost it in the street.\r\nAt the time Yulia Mihailovna was terribly angry with her husband when\r\nshe heard of it.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you told him about the church too?\" she burst out almost in\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\nVon Lembke unmistakably began to brood, and brooding was bad for him,\r\nand had been forbidden by the doctors.","Apart from the fact that there\r\nwere signs of trouble in the province, of which we will speak later, he\r\nhad private reasons for brooding, his heart was wounded, not merely his\r\nofficial dignity. When Andrey Antonovitch had entered upon married life,\r\nhe had never conceived the possibility of conjugal strife, or dissension\r\nin the future. It was inconsistent with the dreams he had cherished\r\nall his life of his Minna or Ernestine.","He felt that he was unequal to\r\nenduring domestic storms. Yulia Mihailovna had an open explanation with\r\nhim at last.\r\n\r\n\"You can't be angry at this,\" she said, \"if only because you've still as\r\nmuch sense as he has, and are immeasurably higher in the social scale.\r\nThe boy still preserves many traces of his old free-thinking habits;\r\nI believe it's simply mischief; but one can do nothing suddenly, in a\r\nhurry; you must do things by degrees.","We must make much of our young\r\npeople; I treat them with affection and hold them back from the brink.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he says such dreadful things,\" Von Lembke objected. \"I can't behave\r\ntolerantly when he maintains in my presence and before other people\r\nthat the government purposely drenches the people with vodka in order to\r\nbrutalise them, and so keep them from revolution. Fancy my position when\r\nI'm forced to listen to that before every one.","\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this, Von Lembke recalled a conversation he had recently\r\nhad with Pyotr Stepanovitch. With the innocent object of displaying his\r\nLiberal tendencies he had shown him his own private collection of every\r\npossible kind of manifesto, Russian and foreign, which he had carefully\r\ncollected since the year 1859, not simply from a love of collecting but\r\nfrom a laudable interest in them. Pyotr Stepanovitch, seeing his object,\r\nexpressed the opinion that there was more sense in one line of some\r\nmanifestoes than in a whole government department, \"not even excluding\r\nyours, maybe.","\"\r\n\r\nLembke winced.\r\n\r\n\"But this is premature among us, premature,\" he pronounced almost\r\nimploringly, pointing to the manifestoes.\r\n\r\n\"No, it's not premature; you see you're afraid, so it's not premature.\"\r\n\r\n\"But here, for instance, is an incitement to destroy churches.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not? You're a sensible man, and of course you don't believe\r\nin it yourself, but you know perfectly well that you need religion to\r\nbrutalise the people.","Truth is honester than falsehood....\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree, I agree, I quite agree with you, but it is premature,\r\npremature in this country...\" said Von Lembke, frowning.\r\n\r\n\"And how can you be an official of the government after that, when you\r\nagree to demolishing churches, and marching on Petersburg armed with\r\nstaves, and make it all simply a question of date?\"\r\n\r\nLembke was greatly put out at being so crudely caught.","\"It's not so, not so at all,\" he cried, carried away and more and more\r\nmortified in his amour-propre. \"You're young, and know nothing of\r\nour aims, and that's why you're mistaken. You see, my dear Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch, you call us officials of the government, don't you?\r\nIndependent officials, don't you? But let me ask you, how are we acting?\r\nOurs is the responsibility, but in the long run we serve the cause of\r\nprogress just as you do.","We only hold together what you are unsettling,\r\nand what, but for us, would go to pieces in all directions. We are not\r\nyour enemies, not a bit of it. We say to you, go forward, progress, you\r\nmay even unsettle things, that is, things that are antiquated and in\r\nneed of reform. But we will keep you, when need be, within necessary\r\nlimits, and so save you from yourselves, for without us you would set\r\nRussia tottering, robbing her of all external decency, while our task is\r\nto preserve external decency.","Understand that we are mutually essential\r\nto one another. In England the Whigs and Tories are in the same way\r\nmutually essential to one another. Well, you're Whigs and we're Tories.\r\nThat's how I look at it.\"\r\n\r\nAndrey Antonovitch rose to positive eloquence. He had been fond of\r\ntalking in a Liberal and intellectual style even in Petersburg, and the\r\ngreat thing here was that there was no one to play the spy on him.","Pyotr Stepanovitch was silent, and maintained an unusually grave air.\r\nThis excited the orator more than ever.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know that I, the 'person responsible for the province,'\" he went\r\non, walking about the study, \"do you know I have so many duties I can't\r\nperform one of them, and, on the other hand, I can say just as truly\r\nthat there's nothing for me to do here. The whole secret of it is,\r\nthat everything depends upon the views of the government.","Suppose the\r\ngovernment were ever to found a republic, from policy, or to pacify\r\npublic excitement, and at the same time to increase the power of the\r\ngovernors, then we governors would swallow up the republic; and not the\r\nrepublic only. Anything you like we'll swallow up. I, at least, feel\r\nthat I am ready. In one word, if the government dictates to me by\r\ntelegram, _activit√© d√©vorante_, I'll supply _activit√© d√©vorante_.","I've\r\ntold them here straight in their faces: 'Dear sirs, to maintain the\r\nequilibrium and to develop all the provincial institutions one thing\r\nis essential; the increase of the power of the governor.' You see it's\r\nnecessary that all these institutions, the zemstvos, the law-courts,\r\nshould have a two-fold existence, that is, on the one hand, it's\r\nnecessary they should exist (I agree that it is necessary), on the other\r\nhand, it's necessary that they shouldn't.","It's all according to the\r\nviews of the government. If the mood takes them so that institutions\r\nseem suddenly necessary, I shall have them at once in readiness. The\r\nnecessity passes and no one will find them under my rule. That's what\r\nI understand by _activit√© d√©vorante_, and you can't have it without an\r\nincrease of the governor's power. We're talking _t√™te-√†-t√™te_. You know\r\nI've already laid before the government in Petersburg the necessity of a\r\nspecial sentinel before the governor's house.","I'm awaiting an answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought to have two,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch commented.\r\n\r\n\"Why two?\" said Von Lembke, stopping short before him.\r\n\r\n\"One's not enough to create respect for you. You certainly ought to have\r\ntwo.\"\r\n\r\nAndrey Antonovitch made a wry face.\r\n\r\n\"You... there's no limit to the liberties you take, Pyotr Stepanovitch.\r\nYou take advantage of my good-nature, you say cutting things, and play\r\nthe part of a _bourru bienfaisant_.","...\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's as you please,\" muttered Pyotr Stepanovitch; \"anyway you\r\npave the way for us and prepare for our success.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, who are 'we,' and what success?\" said Von Lembke, staring at him\r\nin surprise. But he got no answer.\r\n\r\nYulia Mihailovna, receiving a report of the conversation, was greatly\r\ndispleased.\r\n\r\n\"But I can't exercise my official authority upon your favourite,\"\r\nAndrey Antonovitch protested in self-defence, \"especially when we're\r\n_t√™te-√†-t√™te_.","... I may say too much... in the goodness of my heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"From too much goodness of heart. I didn't know you'd got a collection\r\nof manifestoes. Be so good as to show them to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But... he asked to have them for one day.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you've let him have them, again!\" cried Yulia Mihailovna getting\r\nangry. \"How tactless!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll send someone to him at once to get them.\"\r\n\r\n\"He won't give them up.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll insist on it,\" cried Von Lembke, boiling over, and he jumped up\r\nfrom his seat. \"Who's he that we should be so afraid of him, and who am\r\nI that I shouldn't dare to do any thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit down and calm yourself,\" said Yulia Mihailovna, checking him.\r\n\"I will answer your first question. He came to me with the highest\r\nrecommendations. He's talented, and sometimes says extremely clever\r\nthings.","Karmazinov tells me that he has connections almost everywhere,\r\nand extraordinary influence over the younger generation in Petersburg\r\nand Moscow. And if through him I can attract them all and group them\r\nround myself, I shall be saving them from perdition by guiding them\r\ninto a new outlet for their ambitions. He's devoted to me with his whole\r\nheart and is guided by me in everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"But while they're being petted.",".. the devil knows what they may not do.\r\nOf course, it's an idea...\" said Von Lembke, vaguely defending himself,\r\n\"but... but here I've heard that manifestoes of some sort have been\r\nfound in X district.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there was a rumour of that in the summer--manifestoes, false\r\nbank-notes, and all the rest of it, but they haven't found one of them\r\nso far. Who told you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard it from Von Blum.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, don't talk to me of your Blum.","Don't ever dare mention him again!\"\r\n\r\nYulia Mihailovna flew into a rage, and for a moment could not speak. Von\r\nBlum was a clerk in the governor's office whom she particularly hated.\r\nOf that later.\r\n\r\n\"Please don't worry yourself about Verhovensky,\" she said in conclusion.\r\n\"If he had taken part in any mischief he wouldn't talk as he does to\r\nyou, and every one else here. Talkers are not dangerous, and I will\r\neven go so far as to say that if anything were to happen I should be the\r\nfirst to hear of it through him.","He's quite fanatically devoted to me.\"\r\n\r\nI will observe, anticipating events that, had it not been for Yulia\r\nMihailovna's obstinacy and self-conceit, probably nothing of all the\r\nmischief these wretched people succeeded in bringing about amongst us\r\nwould have happened. She was responsible for a great deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. ON THE EVE OF THE FETE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe date of the f√™te which Yulia Mihailovna was getting up for the\r\nbenefit of the governesses of our province had been several times fixed\r\nand put off.","She had invariably bustling round her Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\nand a little clerk, Lyamshin, who used at one time to visit Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch, and had suddenly found favour in the governor's house for\r\nthe way he played the piano and now was of use running errands. Liputin\r\nwas there a good deal too, and Yulia Mihailovna destined him to be the\r\neditor of a new independent provincial paper. There were also several\r\nladies, married and single, and lastly, even Karmazinov who, though he\r\ncould not be said to bustle, announced aloud with a complacent air that\r\nhe would agreeably astonish every one when the literary quadrille began.","An extraordinary multitude of donors and subscribers had turned up, all\r\nthe select society of the town; but even the unselect were admitted, if\r\nonly they produced the cash. Yulia Mihailovna observed that sometimes it\r\nwas a positive duty to allow the mixing of classes, \"for otherwise who\r\nis to enlighten them?\"\r\n\r\nA private drawing-room committee was formed, at which it was decided\r\nthat the f√™te was to be of a democratic character.","The enormous list\r\nof subscriptions tempted them to lavish expenditure. They wanted to do\r\nsomething on a marvellous scale--that's why it was put off. They were\r\nstill undecided where the ball was to take place, whether in the immense\r\nhouse belonging to the marshal's wife, which she was willing to give up\r\nto them for the day, or at Varvara Petrovna's mansion at Skvoreshniki.\r\nIt was rather a distance to Skvoreshniki, but many of the committee were\r\nof opinion that it would be \"freer\" there.","Varvara Petrovna would dearly\r\nhave liked it to have been in her house. It's difficult to understand\r\nwhy this proud woman seemed almost making up to Yulia Mihailovna.\r\nProbably what pleased her was that the latter in her turn seemed almost\r\nfawning upon Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch and was more gracious to him\r\nthan to anyone. I repeat again that Pyotr Stepanovitch was always, in\r\ncontinual whispers, strengthening in the governor's household an idea he\r\nhad insinuated there already, that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was a man who\r\nhad very mysterious connections with very mysterious circles, and that\r\nhe had certainly come here with some commission from them.","People here seemed in a strange state of mind at the time. Among the\r\nladies especially a sort of frivolity was conspicuous, and it could\r\nnot be said to be a gradual growth. Certain very free-and-easy notions\r\nseemed to be in the air. There was a sort of dissipated gaiety and\r\nlevity, and I can't say it was always quite pleasant. A lax way of\r\nthinking was the fashion. Afterwards when it was all over, people blamed\r\nYulia Mihailovna, her circle, her attitude.","But it can hardly have\r\nbeen altogether due to Yulia Mihailovna. On the contrary; at first many\r\npeople vied with one another in praising the new governor's wife for her\r\nsuccess in bringing local society together, and for making things\r\nmore lively. Several scandalous incidents took place, for which Yulia\r\nMihailovna was in no way responsible, but at the time people were amused\r\nand did nothing but laugh, and there was no one to check them.","A rather\r\nlarge group of people, it is true, held themselves aloof, and had views\r\nof their own on the course of events. But even these made no complaint\r\nat the time; they smiled, in fact.\r\n\r\nI remember that a fairly large circle came into existence, as it were,\r\nspontaneously, the centre of which perhaps was really to be found\r\nin Yulia Mihailovna's drawing-room. In this intimate circle which\r\nsurrounded her, among the younger members of it, of course, it was\r\nconsidered admissible to play all sorts of pranks, sometimes rather\r\nfree-and-easy ones, and, in fact, such conduct became a principle among\r\nthem.","In this circle there were even some very charming ladies. The\r\nyoung people arranged picnics, and even parties, and sometimes went\r\nabout the town in a regular cavalcade, in carriages and on horseback.\r\nThey sought out adventures, even got them up themselves, simply for the\r\nsake of having an amusing story to tell. They treated our town as though\r\nit were a sort of Glupov. People called them the jeerers or sneerers,\r\nbecause they did not stick at anything.","It happened, for instance, that\r\nthe wife of a local lieutenant, a little brunette, very young though she\r\nlooked worn out from her husband's ill-treatment, at an evening party\r\nthoughtlessly sat down to play whist for high stakes in the fervent hope\r\nof winning enough to buy herself a mantle, and instead of winning, lost\r\nfifteen roubles. Being afraid of her husband, and having no means of\r\npaying, she plucked up the courage of former days and ventured on the\r\nsly to ask for a loan, on the spot, at the party, from the son of our\r\nmayor, a very nasty youth, precociously vicious.","The latter not only\r\nrefused it, but went laughing aloud to tell her husband. The lieutenant,\r\nwho certainly was poor, with nothing but his salary, took his wife home\r\nand avenged himself upon her to his heart's content in spite of her\r\nshrieks, wails, and entreaties on her knees for forgiveness. This\r\nrevolting story excited nothing but mirth all over the town, and though\r\nthe poor wife did not belong to Yulia Mihailovna's circle, one of the\r\nladies of the \"cavalcade,\" an eccentric and adventurous character who\r\nhappened to know her, drove round, and simply carried her off to her\r\nown house.","Here she was at once taken up by our madcaps, made much of,\r\nloaded with presents, and kept for four days without being sent back to\r\nher husband. She stayed at the adventurous lady's all day long, drove\r\nabout with her and all the sportive company in expeditions about the\r\ntown, and took part in dances and merry-making. They kept egging her\r\non to haul her husband before the court and to make a scandal.","They\r\ndeclared that they would all support her and would come and bear\r\nwitness. The husband kept quiet, not daring to oppose them. The poor\r\nthing realised at last that she had got into a hopeless position and,\r\nmore dead than alive with fright, on the fourth day she ran off in the\r\ndusk from her protectors to her lieutenant. It's not definitely known\r\nwhat took place between husband and wife, but two shutters of the\r\nlow-pitched little house in which the lieutenant lodged were not opened\r\nfor a fortnight.","Yulia Mihailovna was angry with the mischief-makers\r\nwhen she heard about it all, and was greatly displeased with the\r\nconduct of the adventurous lady, though the latter had presented the\r\nlieutenant's wife to her on the day she carried her off. However, this\r\nwas soon forgotten.\r\n\r\nAnother time a petty clerk, a respectable head of a family, married his\r\ndaughter, a beautiful girl of seventeen, known to every one in the town,\r\nto another petty clerk, a young man who came from a different district.","But suddenly it was learned that the young husband had treated the\r\nbeauty very roughly on the wedding night, chastising her for what he\r\nregarded as a stain on his honour. Lyamshin, who was almost a witness of\r\nthe affair, because he got drunk at the wedding and so stayed the night,\r\nas soon as day dawned, ran round with the diverting intelligence.\r\n\r\nInstantly a party of a dozen was made up, all of them on horseback, some\r\non hired Cossack horses, Pyotr Stepanovitch, for instance, and Liputin,\r\nwho, in spite of his grey hairs, took part in almost every scandalous\r\nadventure of our reckless youngsters.","When the young couple appeared in\r\nthe street in a droshky with a pair of horses to make the calls which\r\nare obligatory in our town on the day after a wedding, in spite of\r\nanything that may happen, the whole cavalcade, with merry laughter,\r\nsurrounded the droshky and followed them about the town all the morning.\r\nThey did not, it's true, go into the house, but waited for them\r\noutside, on horseback.","They refrained from marked insult to the bride\r\nor bridegroom, but still they caused a scandal. The whole town began\r\ntalking of it. Every one laughed, of course. But at this Von Lembke was\r\nangry, and again had a lively scene with Yulia Mihailovna. She, too, was\r\nextremely angry, and formed the intention of turning the scapegraces out\r\nof her house. But next day she forgave them all after persuasions from\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch and some words from Karmazinov, who considered the\r\naffair rather amusing.","\"It's in harmony with the traditions of the place,\" he said. \"Anyway\r\nit's characteristic and... bold; and look, every one's laughing, you're\r\nthe only person indignant.\"\r\n\r\nBut there were pranks of a certain character that were absolutely past\r\nendurance.\r\n\r\nA respectable woman of the artisan class, who went about selling\r\ngospels, came into the town. People talked about her, because some\r\ninteresting references to these gospel women had just appeared in the\r\nPetersburg papers.","Again the same buffoon, Lyamshin, with the help of a\r\ndivinity student, who was taking a holiday while waiting for a post in\r\nthe school, succeeded, on the pretence of buying books from the gospel\r\nwoman, in thrusting into her bag a whole bundle of indecent and obscene\r\nphotographs from abroad, sacrificed expressly for the purpose, as we\r\nlearned afterwards, by a highly respectable old gentleman (I will omit\r\nhis name) with an order on his breast, who, to use his own words, loved\r\n\"a healthy laugh and a merry jest.","\" When the poor woman went to take out\r\nthe holy books in the bazaar, the photographs were scattered about the\r\nplace. There were roars of laughter and murmurs of indignation. A crowd\r\ncollected, began abusing her, and would have come to blows if the police\r\nhad not arrived in the nick of time. The gospel woman was taken to\r\nthe lock-up, and only in the evening, thanks to the efforts of Mavriky\r\nNikolaevitch, who had learned with indignation the secret details of\r\nthis loathsome affair, she was released and escorted out of the town.","At\r\nthis point Yulia Mihailovna would certainly have forbidden Lyamshin her\r\nhouse, but that very evening the whole circle brought him to her with\r\nthe intelligence that he had just composed a new piece for the piano,\r\nand persuaded her at least to hear it. The piece turned out to be really\r\namusing, and bore the comic title of \"The Franco-Prussian War.\" It began\r\nwith the menacing strains of the \"Marseillaise\":\r\n\r\n_\"Qu'un sang impur abreuve nos sillons.","\"_\r\n\r\nThere is heard the pompous challenge, the intoxication of future\r\nvictories. But suddenly mingling with the masterly variations on the\r\nnational hymn, somewhere from some corner quite close, on one side come\r\nthe vulgar strains of \"Mein lieber Augustin.\" The \"Marseillaise\" goes\r\non unconscious of them. The \"Marseillaise\" is at the climax of its\r\nintoxication with its own grandeur; but Augustin gains strength;\r\nAugustin grows more and more insolent, and suddenly the melody of\r\nAugustin begins to blend with the melody of the \"Marseillaise.","\" The\r\nlatter begins, as it were, to get angry; becoming aware of Augustin\r\nat last she tries to fling him off, to brush him aside like a tiresome\r\ninsignificant fly. But \"Mein lieber Augustin\" holds his ground firmly,\r\nhe is cheerful and self-confident, he is gleeful and impudent, and the\r\n\"Marseillaise\" seems suddenly to become terribly stupid. She can no\r\nlonger conceal her anger and mortification; it is a wail of indignation,\r\ntears, and curses, with hands outstretched to Providence.","_\"Pas un pouce de notre terrain; pas une de nos forteresses.\"_\r\n\r\nBut she is forced to sing in time with \"Mein lieber Augustin.\" Her\r\nmelody passes in a sort of foolish way into Augustin; she yields and\r\ndies away. And only by snatches there is heard again:\r\n\r\n_\"Qu'un sang impur...\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nBut at once it passes very offensively into the vulgar waltz. She\r\nsubmits altogether. It is Jules Favre sobbing on Bismarck's bosom\r\nand surrendering every thing.","... But at this point Augustin too grows\r\nfierce; hoarse sounds are heard; there is a suggestion of countless\r\ngallons of beer, of a frenzy of self-glorification, demands for\r\nmillions, for fine cigars, champagne, and hostages. Augustin passes into\r\na wild yell.... \"The Franco-Prussian War\" is over. Our circle applauded,\r\nYulia Mihailovna smiled, and said, \"Now, how is one to turn him out?\"\r\nPeace was made.","The rascal really had talent. Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nassured me on one occasion that the very highest artistic talents may\r\nexist in the most abominable blackguards, and that the one thing\r\ndoes not interfere with the other. There was a rumour afterwards that\r\nLyamshin had stolen this burlesque from a talented and modest young man\r\nof his acquaintance, whose name remained unknown. But this is beside the\r\nmark.","This worthless fellow who had hung about Stepan Trofimovitch for\r\nyears, who used at his evening parties, when invited, to mimic Jews of\r\nvarious types, a deaf peasant woman making her confession, or the birth\r\nof a child, now at Yulia Mihailovna's caricatured Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nhimself in a killing way, under the title of \"A Liberal of the\r\nForties.\" Everybody shook with laughter, so that in the end it was\r\nquite impossible to turn him out: he had become too necessary a person.","Besides he fawned upon Pyotr Stepanovitch in a slavish way, and he,\r\nin his turn, had obtained by this time a strange and unaccountable\r\ninfluence over Yulia Mihailovna.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't have talked about this scoundrel, and, indeed, he would not\r\nbe worth dwelling upon, but there was another revolting story, so people\r\ndeclare, in which he had a hand, and this story I cannot omit from my\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nOne morning the news of a hideous and revolting sacrilege was all over\r\nthe town.","At the entrance to our immense marketplace there stands the\r\nancient church of Our Lady's Nativity, which was a remarkable antiquity\r\nin our ancient town. At the gates of the precincts there is a large ikon\r\nof the Mother of God fixed behind a grating in the wall. And behold, one\r\nnight the ikon had been robbed, the glass of the case was broken, the\r\ngrating was smashed and several stones and pearls (I don't know whether\r\nthey were very precious ones) had been removed from the crown and the\r\nsetting.","But what was worse, besides the theft a senseless, scoffing\r\nsacrilege had been perpetrated. Behind the broken glass of the ikon they\r\nfound in the morning, so it was said, a live mouse. Now, four months\r\nsince, it has been established beyond doubt that the crime was committed\r\nby the convict Fedka, but for some reason it is added that Lyamshin took\r\npart in it. At the time no one spoke of Lyamshin or had any suspicion\r\nof him.","But now every one says it was he who put the mouse there. I\r\nremember all our responsible officials were rather staggered. A crowd\r\nthronged round the scene of the crime from early morning. There was a\r\ncrowd continually before it, not a very huge one, but always about a\r\nhundred people, some coming and some going. As they approached they\r\ncrossed themselves and bowed down to the ikon. They began to give\r\nofferings, and a church dish made its appearance, and with the dish a\r\nmonk.","But it was only about three o'clock in the afternoon it occurred\r\nto the authorities that it was possible to prohibit the crowds standing\r\nabout, and to command them when they had prayed, bowed down and left\r\ntheir offerings, to pass on. Upon Von Lembke this unfortunate incident\r\nmade the gloomiest impression. As I was told, Yulia Mihailovna said\r\nafterwards it was from this ill-omened morning that she first noticed in\r\nher husband that strange depression which persisted in him until he\r\nleft our province on account of illness two months ago, and, I believe,\r\nhaunts him still in Switzerland, where he has gone for a rest after his\r\nbrief career amongst us.","I remember at one o'clock in the afternoon I crossed the marketplace;\r\nthe crowd was silent and their faces solemn and gloomy. A merchant, fat\r\nand sallow, drove up, got out of his carriage, made a bow to the ground,\r\nkissed the ikon, offered a rouble, sighing, got back into his carriage\r\nand drove off. Another carriage drove up with two ladies accompanied\r\nby two of our scapegraces. The young people (one of whom was not quite\r\nyoung) got out of their carriage too, and squeezed their way up to the\r\nikon, pushing people aside rather carelessly.","Neither of the young men\r\ntook off his hat, and one of them put a pince-nez on his nose. In the\r\ncrowd there was a murmur, vague but unfriendly. The dandy with the\r\npince-nez took out of his purse, which was stuffed full of bank-notes,\r\na copper farthing and flung it into the dish. Both laughed, and, talking\r\nloudly, went back to their carriage. At that moment Lizaveta Nikolaevna\r\ngalloped up, escorted by Mavriky Nikolaevitch.","She jumped off her horse,\r\nflung the reins to her companion, who, at her bidding, remained on his\r\nhorse, and approached the ikon at the very moment when the farthing had\r\nbeen flung down. A flush of indignation suffused her cheeks; she took\r\noff her round hat and her gloves, fell straight on her knees before the\r\nikon on the muddy pavement, and reverently bowed down three times to the\r\nearth. Then she took out her purse, but as it appeared she had only a\r\nfew small coins in it she instantly took off her diamond ear-rings and\r\nput them in the dish.","\"May I? May I? For the adornment of the setting?\" she asked the monk.\r\n\r\n\"It is permitted,\" replied the latter, \"every gift is good.\" The crowd\r\nwas silent, expressing neither dissent nor approval.\r\n\r\nLiza got on her horse again, in her muddy riding-habit, and galloped\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTwo days after the incident I have described I met her in a numerous\r\ncompany, who were driving out on some expedition in three coaches,\r\nsurrounded by others on horseback.","She beckoned to me, stopped her\r\ncarriage, and pressingly urged me to join their party. A place was\r\nfound for me in the carriage, and she laughingly introduced me to her\r\ncompanions, gorgeously attired ladies, and explained to me that they\r\nwere all going on a very interesting expedition. She was laughing, and\r\nseemed somewhat excessively happy. Just lately she had been very lively,\r\neven playful, in fact.","The expedition was certainly an eccentric one. They were all going to a\r\nhouse the other side of the river, to the merchant Sevastyanov's. In\r\nthe lodge of this merchant's house our saint and prophet, Semyon\r\nYakovlevitch, who was famous not only amongst us but in the surrounding\r\nprovinces and even in Petersburg and Moscow, had been living for the\r\nlast ten years, in retirement, ease, and comfort.","Every one went to see\r\nhim, especially visitors to the neighbourhood, extracting from him some\r\ncrazy utterance, bowing down to him, and leaving an offering. These\r\nofferings were sometimes considerable, and if Semyon Yakovlevitch did\r\nnot himself assign them to some other purpose were piously sent to\r\nsome church or more often to the monastery of Our Lady. A monk from\r\nthe monastery was always in waiting upon Semyon Yakovlevitch with this\r\nobject.","All were in expectation of great amusement. No one of the party had seen\r\nSemyon Yakovlevitch before, except Lyamshin, who declared that the saint\r\nhad given orders that he should be driven out with a broom, and had with\r\nhis own hand flung two big baked potatoes after him. Among the party I\r\nnoticed Pyotr Stepanovitch, again riding a hired Cossack horse, on which\r\nhe sat extremely badly, and Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, also on horseback.","The latter did not always hold aloof from social diversions, and on such\r\noccasions always wore an air of gaiety, although, as always, he spoke\r\nlittle and seldom. When our party had crossed the bridge and reached the\r\nhotel of the town, someone suddenly announced that in one of the rooms\r\nof the hotel they had just found a traveller who had shot himself, and\r\nwere expecting the police. At once the suggestion was made that they\r\nshould go and look at the suicide.","The idea met with approval: our\r\nladies had never seen a suicide. I remember one of them said aloud on\r\nthe occasion, \"Everything's so boring, one can't be squeamish over one's\r\namusements, as long as they're interesting.\" Only a few of them remained\r\noutside. The others went in a body into the dirty corridor, and amongst\r\nthe others I saw, to my amazement, Lizaveta Nikolaevna. The door of the\r\nroom was open, and they did not, of course, dare to prevent our going\r\nin to look at the suicide.","He was quite a young lad, not more than\r\nnineteen. He must have been very good-looking, with thick fair hair,\r\nwith a regular oval face, and a fine, pure forehead. The body was\r\nalready stiff, and his white young face looked like marble. On the table\r\nlay a note, in his handwriting, to the effect that no one was to blame\r\nfor his death, that he had killed himself because he had \"squandered\"\r\nfour hundred roubles.","The word \"squandered\" was used in the letter; in\r\nthe four lines of his letter there were three mistakes in spelling. A\r\nstout country gentleman, evidently a neighbour, who had been staying in\r\nthe hotel on some business of his own, was particularly distressed about\r\nit. From his words it appeared that the boy had been sent by his family,\r\nthat is, a widowed mother, sisters, and aunts, from the country to the\r\ntown in order that, under the supervision of a female relation in the\r\ntown, he might purchase and take home with him various articles for the\r\ntrousseau of his eldest sister, who was going to be married.","The family\r\nhad, with sighs of apprehension, entrusted him with the four hundred\r\nroubles, the savings of ten years, and had sent him on his way with\r\nexhortations, prayers, and signs of the cross. The boy had till then\r\nbeen well-behaved and trustworthy. Arriving three days before at the\r\ntown, he had not gone to his relations, had put up at the hotel, and\r\ngone straight to the club in the hope of finding in some back room a\r\n\"travelling banker,\" or at least some game of cards for money.","But that\r\nevening there was no \"banker\" there or gambling going on. Going back\r\nto the hotel about midnight he asked for champagne, Havana cigars, and\r\nordered a supper of six or seven dishes. But the champagne made him\r\ndrunk, and the cigar made him sick, so that he did not touch the food\r\nwhen it was brought to him, and went to bed almost unconscious. Waking\r\nnext morning as fresh as an apple, he went at once to the gipsies' camp,\r\nwhich was in a suburb beyond the river, and of which he had heard the\r\nday before at the club.","He did not reappear at the hotel for two days.\r\nAt last, at five o'clock in the afternoon of the previous day, he had\r\nreturned drunk, had at once gone to bed, and had slept till ten o'clock\r\nin the evening. On waking up he had asked for a cutlet, a bottle of\r\nChateau d'Yquem, and some grapes, paper, and ink, and his bill. No one\r\nnoticed anything special about him; he was quiet, gentle, and friendly.","He must have shot himself at about midnight, though it was strange that\r\nno one had heard the shot, and they only raised the alarm at midday,\r\nwhen, after knocking in vain, they had broken in the door. The bottle of\r\nChateau d'Yquem was half empty, there was half a plateful of grapes left\r\ntoo. The shot had been fired from a little three-chambered revolver,\r\nstraight into the heart. Very little blood had flowed.","The revolver had\r\ndropped from his hand on to the carpet. The boy himself was half lying\r\nin a corner of the sofa. Death must have been instantaneous. There was\r\nno trace of the anguish of death in the face; the expression was serene,\r\nalmost happy, as though there were no cares in his life. All our party\r\nstared at him with greedy curiosity. In every misfortune of one's\r\nneighbour there is always something cheering for an onlooker--whoever\r\nhe may be.","Our ladies gazed in silence, their companions distinguished\r\nthemselves by their wit and their superb equanimity. One observed that\r\nhis was the best way out of it, and that the boy could not have hit upon\r\nanything more sensible; another observed that he had had a good time if\r\nonly for a moment. A third suddenly blurted out the inquiry why people\r\nhad begun hanging and shooting themselves among us of late, as though\r\nthey had suddenly lost their roots, as though the ground were giving way\r\nunder every one's feet.","People looked coldly at this raisonneur. Then\r\nLyamshin, who prided himself on playing the fool, took a bunch of grapes\r\nfrom the plate; another, laughing, followed his example, and a third\r\nstretched out his hand for the Chateau d'Yquem. But the head of police\r\narriving checked him, and even ordered that the room should be cleared.\r\nAs every one had seen all they wanted they went out without disputing,\r\nthough Lyamshin began pestering the police captain about something.","The\r\ngeneral merrymaking, laughter, and playful talk were twice as lively on\r\nthe latter half of the way.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Semyon Yakovlevitch's just at one o'clock. The gate of the\r\nrather large house stood unfastened, and the approach to the lodge was\r\nopen. We learnt at once that Semyon Yakovlevitch was dining, but was\r\nreceiving guests. The whole crowd of us went in. The room in which the\r\nsaint dined and received visitors had three windows, and was fairly\r\nlarge.","It was divided into two equal parts by a wooden lattice-work\r\npartition, which ran from wall to wall, and was three or four feet high.\r\nOrdinary visitors remained on the outside of this partition, but lucky\r\nones were by the saint's invitation admitted through the partition doors\r\ninto his half of the room. And if so disposed he made them sit down on\r\nthe sofa or on his old leather chairs. He himself invariably sat in\r\nan old-fashioned shabby Voltaire arm-chair.","He was a rather big,\r\nbloated-looking, yellow-faced man of five and fifty, with a bald head\r\nand scanty flaxen hair. He wore no beard; his right cheek was swollen,\r\nand his mouth seemed somehow twisted awry. He had a large wart on\r\nthe left side of his nose; narrow eyes, and a calm, stolid, sleepy\r\nexpression. He was dressed in European style, in a black coat, but had\r\nno waistcoat or tie. A rather coarse, but white shirt, peeped out below\r\nhis coat.","There was something the matter with his feet, I believe, and\r\nhe kept them in slippers. I've heard that he had at one time been a\r\nclerk, and received a rank in the service. He had just finished some\r\nfish soup, and was beginning his second dish of potatoes in their skins,\r\neaten with salt. He never ate anything else, but he drank a great\r\ndeal of tea, of which he was very fond. Three servants provided by\r\nthe merchant were running to and fro about him.","One of them was in a\r\nswallow-tail, the second looked like a workman, and the third like\r\na verger. There was also a very lively boy of sixteen. Besides the\r\nservants there was present, holding a jug, a reverend, grey-headed\r\nmonk, who was a little too fat. On one of the tables a huge samovar was\r\nboiling, and a tray with almost two dozen glasses was standing near it.\r\nOn another table opposite offerings had been placed: some loaves and\r\nalso some pounds of sugar, two pounds of tea, a pair of embroidered\r\nslippers, a foulard handkerchief, a length of cloth, a piece of linen,\r\nand so on.","Money offerings almost all went into the monk's jug. The room\r\nwas full of people, at least a dozen visitors, of whom two were sitting\r\nwith Semyon Yakovlevitch on the other side of the partition. One was a\r\ngrey-headed old pilgrim of the peasant class, and the other a little,\r\ndried-up monk, who sat demurely, with his eyes cast down. The other\r\nvisitors were all standing on the near side of the partition, and\r\nwere mostly, too, of the peasant class, except one elderly and\r\npoverty-stricken lady, one landowner, and a stout merchant, who had come\r\nfrom the district town, a man with a big beard, dressed in the Russian\r\nstyle, though he was known to be worth a hundred thousand.","All were waiting for their chance, not daring to speak of themselves.\r\nFour were on their knees, but the one who attracted most attention\r\nwas the landowner, a stout man of forty-five, kneeling right at the\r\npartition, more conspicuous than any one, waiting reverently for a\r\npropitious word or look from Semyon Yakovlevitch. He had been there for\r\nabout an hour already, but the saint still did not notice him.","Our ladies crowded right up to the partition, whispering gaily and\r\nlaughingly together. They pushed aside or got in front of all the other\r\nvisitors, even those on their knees, except the landowner, who remained\r\nobstinately in his prominent position even holding on to the\r\npartition. Merry and greedily inquisitive eyes were turned upon Semyon\r\nYakovlevitch, as well as lorgnettes, pince-nez, and even opera-glasses.","Lyamshin, at any rate, looked through an opera-glass. Semyon\r\nYakovlevitch calmly and lazily scanned all with his little eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Milovzors! Milovzors!\" he deigned to pronounce, in a hoarse bass, and\r\nslightly staccato.\r\n\r\nAll our party laughed: \"What's the meaning of 'Milovzors'?\" But Semyon\r\nYakovlevitch relapsed into silence, and finished his potatoes. Presently\r\nhe wiped his lips with his napkin, and they handed him tea.","As a rule, he did not take tea alone, but poured out some for his\r\nvisitors, but by no means for all, usually pointing himself to those\r\nhe wished to honour. And his choice always surprised people by its\r\nunexpectedness. Passing by the wealthy and the high-placed, he sometimes\r\npitched upon a peasant or some decrepit old woman. Another time he\r\nwould pass over the beggars to honour some fat wealthy merchant.","Tea was\r\nserved differently, too, to different people, sugar was put into some of\r\nthe glasses and handed separately with others, while some got it without\r\nany sugar at all. This time the favoured one was the monk sitting by\r\nhim, who had sugar put in; and the old pilgrim, to whom it was given\r\nwithout any sugar. The fat monk with the jug, from the monastery, for\r\nsome reason had none handed to him at all, though up till then he had\r\nhad his glass every day.","\"Semyon Yakovlevitch, do say something to me. I've been longing to make\r\nyour acquaintance for ever so long,\" carolled the gorgeously dressed\r\nlady from our carriage, screwing up her eyes and smiling. She was\r\nthe lady who had observed that one must not be squeamish about one's\r\namusements, so long as they were interesting. Semyon Yakovlevitch did\r\nnot even look at her. The kneeling landowner uttered a deep, sonorous\r\nsigh, like the sound of a big pair of bellows.","\"With sugar in it!\" said Semyon Yakovlevitch suddenly, pointing to the\r\nwealthy merchant. The latter moved forward and stood beside the kneeling\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n\"Some more sugar for him!\" ordered Semyon Yakovlevitch, after the glass\r\nhad already been poured out. They put some more in. \"More, more, for\r\nhim!\" More was put in a third time, and again a fourth. The merchant\r\nbegan submissively drinking his syrup.","\"Heavens!\" whispered the people, crossing themselves. The kneeling\r\ngentleman again heaved a deep, sonorous sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Father! Semyon Yakovlevitch!\" The voice of the poor lady rang out all\r\nat once plaintively, though so sharply that it was startling. Our party\r\nhad shoved her back to the wall. \"A whole hour, dear father, I've been\r\nwaiting for grace. Speak to me. Consider my case in my helplessness.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask her,\" said Semyon Yakovlevitch to the verger, who went to the\r\npartition.\r\n\r\n\"Have you done what Semyon Yakovlevitch bade you last time?\" he asked\r\nthe widow in a soft and measured voice.\r\n\r\n\"Done it! Father Semyon Yakovlevitch. How can one do it with them?\"\r\nwailed the widow. \"They're cannibals; they're lodging a complaint\r\nagainst me, in the court; they threaten to take it to the senate.","That's\r\nhow they treat their own mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"Give her!\" Semyon Yakovlevitch pointed to a sugar-loaf. The boy skipped\r\nup, seized the sugar-loaf and dragged it to the widow.\r\n\r\n\"Ach, father; great is your merciful kindness. What am I to do with so\r\nmuch?\" wailed the widow.\r\n\r\n\"More, more,\" said Semyon Yakovlevitch lavishly.\r\n\r\nThey dragged her another sugar-loaf. \"More, more!\" the saint commanded.","They took her a third, and finally a fourth. The widow was surrounded\r\nwith sugar on all sides. The monk from the monastery sighed; all this\r\nmight have gone to the monastery that day as it had done on former\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\n\"What am I to do with so much,\" the widow sighed obsequiously. \"It's\r\nenough to make one person sick!... Is it some sort of a prophecy,\r\nfather?\"\r\n\r\n\"Be sure it's by way of a prophecy,\" said someone in the crowd.","\"Another pound for her, another!\" Semyon Yakovlevitch persisted.\r\n\r\nThere was a whole sugar-loaf still on the table, but the saint ordered a\r\npound to be given, and they gave her a pound.\r\n\r\n\"Lord have mercy on us!\" gasped the people, crossing themselves. \"It's\r\nsurely a prophecy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sweeten your heart for the future with mercy and loving kindness, and\r\nthen come to make complaints against your own children; bone of your\r\nbone.","That's what we must take this emblem to mean,\" the stout monk\r\nfrom the monastery, who had had no tea given to him, said softly but\r\nself-complacently, taking upon himself the r√¥le of interpreter in an\r\naccess of wounded vanity.\r\n\r\n\"What are you saying, father?\" cried the widow, suddenly infuriated.\r\n\"Why, they dragged me into the fire with a rope round me when the\r\nVerhishins' house was burnt, and they locked up a dead cat in my chest.","They are ready to do any villainy....\"\r\n\r\n\"Away with her! Away with her!\" Semyon Yakovlevitch said suddenly,\r\nwaving his hands.\r\n\r\nThe verger and the boy dashed through the partition. The verger took the\r\nwidow by the arm, and without resisting she trailed to the door, keeping\r\nher eyes fixed on the loaves of sugar that had been bestowed on her,\r\nwhich the boy dragged after her.\r\n\r\n\"One to be taken away.","Take it away,\" Semyon Yakovlevitch commanded to\r\nthe servant like a workman, who remained with him. The latter rushed\r\nafter the retreating woman, and the three servants returned somewhat\r\nlater bringing back one loaf of sugar which had been presented to the\r\nwidow and now taken away from her. She carried off three, however.\r\n\r\n\"Semyon Yakovlevitch,\" said a voice at the door. \"I dreamt of a bird, a\r\njackdaw; it flew out of the water and flew into the fire.","What does the\r\ndream mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Frost,\" Semyon Yakovlevitch pronounced.\r\n\r\n\"Semyon Yakovlevitch, why don't you answer me all this time? I've been\r\ninterested in you ever so long,\" the lady of our party began again.\r\n\r\n\"Ask him!\" said Semyon Yakovlevitch, not heeding her, but pointing to\r\nthe kneeling gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe monk from the monastery to whom the order was given moved sedately\r\nto the kneeling figure.","\"How have you sinned? And was not some command laid upon you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to fight; not to give the rein to my hands,\" answered the kneeling\r\ngentleman hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\"Have you obeyed?\" asked the monk.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot obey. My own strength gets the better of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Away with him, away with him! With a broom, with a broom!\" cried Semyon\r\nYakovlevitch, waving his hands. The gentleman rushed out of the room\r\nwithout waiting for this penalty.","\"He's left a gold piece where he knelt,\" observed the monk, picking up a\r\nhalf-imperial.\r\n\r\n\"For him!\" said the saint, pointing to the rich merchant. The latter\r\ndared not refuse it, and took it.\r\n\r\n\"Gold to gold,\" the monk from the monastery could not refrain from\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\n\"And give him some with sugar in it,\" said the saint, pointing to\r\nMavriky Nikolaevitch. The servant poured out the tea and took it by\r\nmistake to the dandy with the pince-nez.","\"The long one, the long one!\" Semyon Yakovlevitch corrected him.\r\n\r\nMavriky Nikolaevitch took the glass, made a military half-bow, and began\r\ndrinking it. I don't know why, but all our party burst into peals of\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\"Mavriky Nikolaevitch,\" cried Liza, addressing him suddenly. \"That\r\nkneeling gentleman has gone away. You kneel down in his place.\"\r\n\r\nMavriky Nikolaevitch looked at her in amazement.","\"I beg you to. You'll do me the greatest favour. Listen, Mavriky\r\nNikolaevitch,\" she went on, speaking in an emphatic, obstinate, excited,\r\nand rapid voice. \"You must kneel down; I must see you kneel down. If you\r\nwon't, don't come near me. I insist, I insist!\"\r\n\r\nI don't know what she meant by it; but she insisted upon it\r\nrelentlessly, as though she were in a fit. Mavriky Nikolaevitch, as\r\nwe shall see later, set down these capricious impulses, which had been\r\nparticularly frequent of late, to outbreaks of blind hatred for him,\r\nnot due to spite, for, on the contrary, she esteemed him, loved him,\r\nand respected him, and he knew that himself--but from a peculiar\r\nunconscious hatred which at times she could not control.","In silence he gave his cup to an old woman standing behind him, opened\r\nthe door of the partition, and, without being invited, stepped into\r\nSemyon Yakovlevitch's private apartment, and knelt down in the middle\r\nof the room in sight of all. I imagine that he was deeply shocked in his\r\ncandid and delicate heart by Liza's coarse and mocking freak before\r\nthe whole company. Perhaps he imagined that she would feel ashamed of\r\nherself, seeing his humiliation, on which she had so insisted.","Of course\r\nno one but he would have dreamt of bringing a woman to reason by\r\nso na√Øve and risky a proceeding. He remained kneeling with his\r\nimperturbable gravity--long, tall, awkward, and ridiculous. But our\r\nparty did not laugh. The unexpectedness of the action produced a painful\r\nshock. Every one looked at Liza.\r\n\r\n\"Anoint, anoint!\" muttered Semyon Yakovlevitch.\r\n\r\nLiza suddenly turned white, cried out, and rushed through the partition.","Then a rapid and hysterical scene followed. She began pulling Mavriky\r\nNikolaevitch up with all her might, tugging at his elbows with both\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"Get up! Get up!\" she screamed, as though she were crazy. \"Get up at\r\nonce, at once. How dare you?\"\r\n\r\nMavriky Nikolaevitch got up from his knees. She clutched his arms above\r\nthe elbow and looked intently into his face. There was terror in her\r\nexpression.","\"Milovzors! Milovzors!\" Semyon Yakovlevitch repeated again.\r\n\r\nShe dragged Mavriky Nikolaevitch back to the other part of the room at\r\nlast. There was some commotion in all our company. The lady from our\r\ncarriage, probably intending to relieve the situation, loudly and\r\nshrilly asked the saint for the third time, with an affected smile:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Semyon Yakovlevitch, won't you utter some saying for me? I've\r\nbeen reckoning so much on you.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Out with the ----, out with the ----,\" said Semyon Yakovlevitch, suddenly\r\naddressing her, with an extremely indecent word. The words were uttered\r\nsavagely, and with horrifying distinctness. Our ladies shrieked, and\r\nrushed headlong away, while the gentlemen escorting them burst into\r\nHomeric laughter. So ended our visit to Semyon Yakovlevitch.\r\n\r\nAt this point, however, there took place, I am told, an extremely\r\nenigmatic incident, and, I must own, it was chiefly on account of it\r\nthat I have described this expedition so minutely.","I am told that when all flocked out, Liza, supported by Mavriky\r\nNikolaevitch, was jostled against Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch in the crush\r\nin the doorway. I must mention that since that Sunday morning when she\r\nfainted they had not approached each other, nor exchanged a word, though\r\nthey had met more than once. I saw them brought together in the doorway.\r\nI fancied they both stood still for an instant, and looked, as it were,\r\nstrangely at one another, but I may not have seen rightly in the\r\ncrowd.","It is asserted, on the contrary, and quite seriously, that Liza,\r\nglancing at Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, quickly raised her hand to the\r\nlevel of his face, and would certainly have struck him if he had not\r\ndrawn back in time. Perhaps she was displeased with the expression of\r\nhis face, or the way he smiled, particularly just after such an episode\r\nwith Mavriky Nikolaevitch. I must admit I saw nothing myself, but all\r\nthe others declared they had, though they certainly could not all have\r\nseen it in such a crush, though perhaps some may have.","But I did\r\nnot believe it at the time. I remember, however, that Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch was rather pale all the way home.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same time, and certainly on the same day, the interview\r\nat last took place between Stepan Trofimovitch and Varvara Petrovna. She\r\nhad long had this meeting in her mind, and had sent word about it to\r\nher former friend, but for some reason she had kept putting it off till\r\nthen.","It took place at Skvoreshniki; Varvara Petrovna arrived at her\r\ncountry house all in a bustle; it had been definitely decided the\r\nevening before that the f√™te was to take place at the marshal's, but\r\nVarvara Petrovna's rapid brain at once grasped that no one could\r\nprevent her from afterwards giving her own special entertainment at\r\nSkvoreshniki, and again assembling the whole town. Then every one could\r\nsee for themselves whose house was best, and in which more taste was\r\ndisplayed in receiving guests and giving a ball.","Altogether she was\r\nhardly to be recognised. She seemed completely transformed, and instead\r\nof the unapproachable \"noble lady\" (Stepan Trofimovitch's expression)\r\nseemed changed into the most commonplace, whimsical society woman. But\r\nperhaps this may only have been on the surface.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the empty house she had gone through all the rooms,\r\naccompanied by her faithful old butler, Alexey Yegorytch, and by\r\nFomushka, a man who had seen much of life and was a specialist in\r\ndecoration.","They began to consult and deliberate: what furniture was to\r\nbe brought from the town house, what things, what pictures, where they\r\nwere to be put, how the conservatories and flowers could be put to\r\nthe best use, where to put new curtains, where to have the refreshment\r\nrooms, whether one or two, and so on and so on. And, behold, in the\r\nmidst of this exciting bustle she suddenly took it into her head to send\r\nfor Stepan Trofimovitch.","The latter had long before received notice of this interview and was\r\nprepared for it, and he had every day been expecting just such a sudden\r\nsummons. As he got into the carriage he crossed himself: his fate was\r\nbeing decided. He found his friend in the big drawing-room on the little\r\nsofa in the recess, before a little marble table with a pencil and paper\r\nin her hands. Fomushka, with a yard measure, was measuring the height\r\nof the galleries and the windows, while Varvara Petrovna herself was\r\nwriting down the numbers and making notes on the margin.","She nodded in\r\nStepan Trofimovitch's direction without breaking off from what she was\r\ndoing, and when the latter muttered some sort of greeting, she hurriedly\r\ngave him her hand, and without looking at him motioned him to a seat\r\nbeside her.\r\n\r\n\"I sat waiting for five minutes, 'mastering my heart,'\" he told me\r\nafterwards. \"I saw before me not the woman whom I had known for twenty\r\nyears. An absolute conviction that all was over gave me a strength which\r\nastounded even her.","I swear that she was surprised at my stoicism in\r\nthat last hour.\"\r\n\r\nVarvara Petrovna suddenly put down her pencil on the table and turned\r\nquickly to Stepan Trofimovitch.\r\n\r\n\"Stepan Trofimovitch, we have to talk of business. I'm sure you have\r\nprepared all your fervent words and various phrases, but we'd better go\r\nstraight to the point, hadn't we?\"\r\n\r\nShe had been in too great a hurry to show the tone she meant to take.","And what might not come next?\r\n\r\n\"Wait, be quiet; let me speak. Afterwards you shall, though really I\r\ndon't know what you can answer me,\" she said in a rapid patter. \"The\r\ntwelve hundred roubles of your pension I consider a sacred obligation\r\nto pay you as long as you live. Though why a sacred obligation, simply\r\na contract; that would be a great deal more real, wouldn't it? If you\r\nlike, we'll write it out.","Special arrangements have been made in case\r\nof my death. But you are receiving from me at present lodging, servants,\r\nand your maintenance in addition. Reckoning that in money it would\r\namount to fifteen hundred roubles, wouldn't it? I will add another three\r\nhundred roubles, making three thousand roubles in all. Will that be\r\nenough a year for you? I think that's not too little? In any extreme\r\nemergency I would add something more.","And so, take your money, send me\r\nback my servants, and live by yourself where you like in Petersburg, in\r\nMoscow, abroad, or here, only not with me. Do you hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only lately those lips dictated to me as imperatively and as suddenly\r\nvery different demands,\" said Stepan Trofimovitch slowly and with\r\nsorrowful distinctness. \"I submitted... and danced the Cossack dance\r\nto please you. _Oui, la comparaison peut √™tre permise.","C'√©tait comme un\r\npetit Cosaque du Don qui sautait sur sa propre tombe._ Now...\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop, Stepan Trofimovitch, you are horribly long-winded. You didn't\r\ndance, but came to see me in a new tie, new linen, gloves, scented\r\nand pomatumed. I assure you that you were very anxious to get married\r\nyourself; it was written on your face, and I assure you a most unseemly\r\nexpression it was. If I did not mention it to you at the time, it was\r\nsimply out of delicacy.","But you wished it, you wanted to be married, in\r\nspite of the abominable things you wrote about me and your betrothed.\r\nNow it's very different. And what has the Cosaque du Don to do with it,\r\nand what tomb do you mean? I don't understand the comparison. On the\r\ncontrary, you have only to live. Live as long as you can. I shall be\r\ndelighted.\"\r\n\r\n\"In an almshouse?\"\r\n\r\n\"In an almshouse? People don't go into almshouses with three thousand\r\nroubles a year.","Ah, I remember,\" she laughed. \"Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\ndid joke about an almshouse once. Bah, there certainly is a special\r\nalmshouse, which is worth considering. It's for persons who are highly\r\nrespectable; there are colonels there, and there's positively one\r\ngeneral who wants to get into it. If you went into it with all your\r\nmoney, you would find peace, comfort, servants to wait on you. There you\r\ncould occupy yourself with study, and could always make up a party for\r\ncards.","\"\r\n\r\n_\"Passons.\"_\r\n\r\n_\"Passons?\"_ Varvara Petrovna winced. \"But, if so, that's all. You've been\r\ninformed that we shall live henceforward entirely apart.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that's all?\" he said. \"All that's left of twenty years? Our last\r\nfarewell?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're awfully fond of these exclamations, Stepan Trofimovitch. It's\r\nnot at all the fashion. Nowadays people talk roughly but simply. You\r\nkeep harping on our twenty years! Twenty years of mutual vanity, and\r\nnothing more.","Every letter you've written me was written not for me but\r\nfor posterity. You're a stylist, and not a friend, and friendship is\r\nonly a splendid word. In reality--a mutual exchange of sloppiness....\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens! How many sayings not your own! Lessons learned by heart!\r\nThey've already put their uniform on you too. You, too, are rejoicing;\r\nyou, too, are basking in the sunshine. _Ch√®re, ch√®re,_ for what a mess of\r\npottage you have sold them your freedom!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not a parrot, to repeat other people's phrases!\" cried Varvara\r\nPetrovna, boiling over.","\"You may be sure I have stored up many sayings\r\nof my own. What have you been doing for me all these twenty years? You\r\nrefused me even the books I ordered for you, though, except for the\r\nbinder, they would have remained uncut. What did you give me to read\r\nwhen I asked you during those first years to be my guide? Always Kapfig,\r\nand nothing but Kapfig. You were jealous of my culture even, and took\r\nmeasures.","And all the while every one's laughing at you. I must confess\r\nI always considered you only as a critic. You are a literary critic and\r\nnothing more. When on the way to Petersburg I told you that I meant\r\nto found a journal and to devote my whole life to it, you looked at me\r\nironically at once, and suddenly became horribly supercilious.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was not that, not that.... we were afraid then of\r\npersecution.","...\"\r\n\r\n\"It was just that. And you couldn't have been afraid of persecution in\r\nPetersburg at that time. Do you remember that in February, too, when the\r\nnews of the emancipation came, you ran to me in a panic, and demanded\r\nthat I should at once give you a written statement that the proposed\r\nmagazine had nothing to do with you; that the young people had been\r\ncoming to see me and not you; that you were only a tutor who lived in\r\nthe house, only because he had not yet received his salary.","Isn't that\r\nso? Do remember that? You have distinguished yourself all your life,\r\nStepan Trofimovitch.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was only a moment of weakness, a moment when we were alone,\" he\r\nexclaimed mournfully. \"But is it possible, is it possible, to break\r\noff everything for the sake of such petty impressions? Can it be that\r\nnothing more has been left between us after those long years?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are horribly calculating; you keep trying to leave me in your debt.","When you came back from abroad you looked down upon me and wouldn't\r\nlet me utter a word, but when I came back myself and talked to you\r\nafterwards of my impressions of the Madonna, you wouldn't hear me,\r\nyou began smiling condescendingly into your cravat, as though I were\r\nincapable of the same feelings as you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not so. It was probably not so. _J'ai oubli√©!_\"\r\n\r\n\"No; it was so,\" she answered, \"and, what's more, you've nothing to\r\npride yourself on.","That's all nonsense, and one of your fancies. Now,\r\nthere's no one, absolutely no one, in ecstasies over the Madonna; no\r\none wastes time over it except old men who are hopelessly out of date.\r\nThat's established.\"\r\n\r\n\"Established, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's of no use whatever. This jug's of use because one can pour water\r\ninto it. This pencil's of use because you can write anything with it.\r\nBut that woman's face is inferior to any face in nature.","Try drawing\r\nan apple, and put a real apple beside it. Which would you take? You\r\nwouldn't make a mistake, I'm sure. This is what all our theories amount\r\nto, now that the first light of free investigation has dawned upon\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"You laugh ironically. And what used you to say to me about charity?\r\nYet the enjoyment derived from charity is a haughty and immoral\r\nenjoyment. The rich man's enjoyment in his wealth, his power, and in the\r\ncomparison of his importance with the poor.","Charity corrupts giver and\r\ntaker alike; and, what's more, does not attain its object, as it\r\nonly increases poverty. Fathers who don't want to work crowd round the\r\ncharitable like gamblers round the gambling-table, hoping for gain,\r\nwhile the pitiful farthings that are flung them are a hundred times too\r\nlittle. Have you given away much in your life? Less than a rouble, if\r\nyou try and think. Try to remember when last you gave away anything;\r\nit'll be two years ago, maybe four.","You make an outcry and only hinder\r\nthings. Charity ought to be forbidden by law, even in the present state\r\nof society. In the new regime there will be no poor at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what an eruption of borrowed phrases! So it's come to the new\r\nregime already? Unhappy woman, God help you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; it has, Stepan Trofimovitch. You carefully concealed all these new\r\nideas from me, though every one's familiar with them nowadays.","And you\r\ndid it simply out of jealousy, so as to have power over me. So that now\r\neven that Yulia is a hundred miles ahead of me. But now my eyes have\r\nbeen opened. I have defended you, Stepan Trofimovitch, all I could, but\r\nthere is no one who does not blame you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough!\" said he, getting up from his seat. \"Enough! And what can I\r\nwish you now, unless it's repentance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit still a minute, Stepan Trofimovitch.","I have another question to ask\r\nyou. You've been told of the invitation to read at the literary matin√©e.\r\nIt was arranged through me. Tell me what you're going to read?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, about that very Queen of Queens, that ideal of humanity, the\r\nSistine Madonna, who to your thinking is inferior to a glass or a\r\npencil.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you're not taking something historical?'\" said Varvara Petrovna\r\nin mournful surprise.","\"But they won't listen to you. You've got that\r\nMadonna on your brain. You seem bent on putting every one to sleep! Let\r\nme assure you, Stepan Trofimovitch, I am speaking entirely in your own\r\ninterest. It would be a different matter if you would take some short\r\nbut interesting story of medi√¶val court life from Spanish history, or,\r\nbetter still, some anecdote, and pad it out with other anecdotes and\r\nwitty phrases of your own.","There were magnificent courts then; ladies,\r\nyou know, poisonings. Karmazinov says it would be strange if you\r\ncouldn't read something interesting from Spanish history.\"\r\n\r\n\"Karmazinov--that fool who has written himself out--looking for a\r\nsubject for me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Karmazinov, that almost imperial intellect. You are too free in your\r\nlanguage, Stepan Trofimovitch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Karmazinov is a spiteful old woman whose day is over.","_Ch√®re,\r\nch√®re,_ how long have you been so enslaved by them? Oh God!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't endure him even now for the airs he gives himself. But I do\r\njustice to his intellect. I repeat, I have done my best to defend you\r\nas far as I could. And why do you insist on being absurd and tedious?\r\nOn the contrary, come on to the platform with a dignified smile as\r\nthe representative of the last generation, and tell them two or three\r\nanecdotes in your witty way, as only you can tell things sometimes.","Though you may be an old man now, though you may belong to a past age,\r\nthough you may have dropped behind them, in fact, yet you'll recognise\r\nit yourself, with a smile, in your preface, and all will see that you're\r\nan amiable, good-natured, witty relic... in brief, a man of the old\r\nsavour, and so far advanced as to be capable of appreciating at their\r\nvalue all the absurdities of certain ideas which you have hitherto\r\nfollowed.","Come, as a favour to me, I beg you.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ch√®re,_ enough. Don't ask me. I can't. I shall speak of the Madonna,\r\nbut I shall raise a storm that will either crush them all or shatter me\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will certainly be you alone, Stepan Trofimovitch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such is my fate. I will speak of the contemptible slave, of the\r\nstinking, depraved flunkey who will first climb a ladder with scissors\r\nin his hands, and slash to pieces the divine image of the great ideal,\r\nin the name of equality, envy, and.",".. digestion. Let my curse thunder\r\nout upon them, and then--then...\"\r\n\r\n\"The madhouse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps. But in any case, whether I shall be left vanquished or\r\nvictorious, that very evening I shall take my bag, my beggar's bag.\r\nI shall leave all my goods and chattels, all your presents, all your\r\npensions and promises of future benefits, and go forth on foot to end my\r\nlife a tutor in a merchant's family or to die somewhere of hunger in a\r\nditch.","I have said it. _Alea jacta est._\" He got up again.\r\n\r\n\"I've been convinced for years,\" said Varvara Petrovna, getting up with\r\nflashing eyes, \"that your only object in life is to put me and my house\r\nto shame by your calumnies! What do you mean by being a tutor in a\r\nmerchant's family or dying in a ditch? It's spite, calumny, and nothing\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have always despised me. But I will end like a knight, faithful to\r\nmy lady.","Your good opinion has always been dearer to me than\r\nanything. From this moment I will take nothing, but will worship you\r\ndisinterestedly.\"\r\n\r\n\"How stupid that is!\"\r\n\r\n\"You have never respected me. I may have had a mass of weaknesses. Yes,\r\nI have sponged on you. I speak the language of nihilism, but sponging\r\nhas never been the guiding motive of my action. It has happened so\r\nof itself. I don't know how.","... I always imagined there was something\r\nhigher than meat and drink between us, and--I've never, never been a\r\nscoundrel! And so, to take the open road, to set things right. I set\r\noff late, late autumn out of doors, the mist lies over the fields, the\r\nhoarfrost of old age covers the road before me, and the wind howls about\r\nthe approaching grave.... But so forward, forward, on my new way\r\n\r\n     'Filled with purest love and fervour,\r\n     Faith which my sweet dream did yield.","'\r\n\r\nOh, my dreams. Farewell. Twenty years. _Alea jacta est!_\"\r\n\r\nHis face was wet with a sudden gush of tears. He took his hat.\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand Latin,\" said Varvara Petrovna, doing her best to\r\ncontrol herself.\r\n\r\nWho knows, perhaps, she too felt like crying. But caprice and\r\nindignation once more got the upper hand.\r\n\r\n\"I know only one thing, that all this is childish nonsense. You will\r\nnever be capable of carrying out your threats, which are a mass of\r\negoism.","You will set off nowhere, to no merchant; you'll end very\r\npeaceably on my hands, taking your pension, and receiving your utterly\r\nimpossible friends on Tuesdays. Good-bye, Stepan Trofimovitch.\"\r\n\r\n_\"Alea jacta est!\"_ He made her a deep bow, and returned home, almost\r\ndead with emotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. PYOTR STEPANOVITCH IS BUSY\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe date of the f√™te was definitely fixed, and Von Lembke became more\r\nand more depressed.","He was full of strange and sinister forebodings,\r\nand this made Yulia Mihailovna seriously uneasy. Indeed, things were not\r\naltogether satisfactory. Our mild governor had left the affairs of the\r\nprovince a little out of gear; at the moment we were threatened with\r\ncholera; serious outbreaks of cattle plague had appeared in several\r\nplaces; fires were prevalent that summer in towns and villages; whilst\r\namong the peasantry foolish rumours of incendiarism grew stronger and\r\nstronger.","Cases of robbery were twice as numerous as usual. But all\r\nthis, of course, would have been perfectly ordinary had there been\r\nno other and more weighty reasons to disturb the equanimity of Andrey\r\nAntonovitch, who had till then been in good spirits.\r\n\r\nWhat struck Yulia Mihailovna most of all was that he became more silent\r\nand, strange to say, more secretive every day. Yet it was hard to\r\nimagine what he had to hide.","It is true that he rarely opposed her and\r\nas a rule followed her lead without question. At her instigation, for\r\ninstance, two or three regulations of a risky and hardly legal character\r\nwere introduced with the object of strengthening the authority of the\r\ngovernor. There were several ominous instances of transgressions being\r\ncondoned with the same end in view; persons who deserved to be sent to\r\nprison and Siberia were, solely because she insisted, recommended\r\nfor promotion.","Certain complaints and inquiries were deliberately and\r\nsystematically ignored. All this came out later on. Not only did Lembke\r\nsign everything, but he did not even go into the question of the share\r\ntaken by his wife in the execution of his duties. On the other hand, he\r\nbegan at times to be restive about \"the most trifling matters,\" to the\r\nsurprise of Yulia Mihailovna. No doubt he felt the need to make up for\r\nthe days of suppression by brief moments of mutiny.","Unluckily,\r\nYulia Mihailovna was unable, for all her insight, to understand this\r\nhonourable punctiliousness in an honourable character. Alas, she had\r\nno thought to spare for that, and that was the source of many\r\nmisunderstandings.\r\n\r\nThere are some things of which it is not suitable for me to write, and\r\nindeed I am not in a position to do so. It is not my business to discuss\r\nthe blunders of administration either, and I prefer to leave out this\r\nadministrative aspect of the subject altogether.","In the chronicle I have\r\nbegun I've set before myself a different task. Moreover a great deal\r\nwill be brought to light by the Commission of Inquiry which has just\r\nbeen appointed for our province; it's only a matter of waiting a little.\r\nCertain explanations, however, cannot be omitted.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Yulia Mihailovna. The poor lady (I feel very sorry for\r\nher) might have attained all that attracted and allured her (renown and\r\nso on) without any such violent and eccentric actions as she resolved\r\nupon at the very first step.","But either from an exaggerated passion for\r\nthe romantic or from the frequently blighted hopes of her youth, she\r\nfelt suddenly, at the change of her fortunes, that she had become one of\r\nthe specially elect, almost God's anointed, \"over whom there gleamed a\r\nburning tongue of fire,\" and this tongue of flame was the root of the\r\nmischief, for, after all, it is not like a chignon, which will fit any\r\nwoman's head.","But there is nothing of which it is more difficult to\r\nconvince a woman than of this; on the contrary, anyone who cares to\r\nencourage the delusion in her will always be sure to meet with success.\r\nAnd people vied with one another in encouraging the delusion in Yulia\r\nMihailovna. The poor woman became at once the sport of conflicting\r\ninfluences, while fully persuaded of her own originality. Many clever\r\npeople feathered their nests and took advantage of her simplicity during\r\nthe brief period of her rule in the province.","And what a jumble there\r\nwas under this assumption of independence! She was fascinated at the\r\nsame time by the aristocratic element and the system of big landed\r\nproperties and the increase of the governor's power, and the democratic\r\nelement, and the new reforms and discipline, and free-thinking and stray\r\nSocialistic notions, and the correct tone of the aristocratic salon and\r\nthe free-and-easy, almost pot-house, manners of the young people that\r\nsurrounded her.","She dreamed of \"giving happiness\" and reconciling\r\nthe irreconcilable, or, rather, of uniting all and everything in\r\nthe adoration of her own person. She had favourites too; she was\r\nparticularly fond of Pyotr Stepanovitch, who had recourse at times to\r\nthe grossest flattery in dealing with her. But she was attracted by him\r\nfor another reason, an amazing one, and most characteristic of the\r\npoor lady: she was always hoping that he would reveal to her a regular\r\nconspiracy against the government.","Difficult as it is to imagine such\r\na thing, it really was the case. She fancied for some reason that there\r\nmust be a nihilist plot concealed in the province. By his silence at one\r\ntime and his hints at another Pyotr Stepanovitch did much to strengthen\r\nthis strange idea in her. She imagined that he was in communication with\r\nevery revolutionary element in Russia but at the same time passionately\r\ndevoted to her.","To discover the plot, to receive the gratitude of the\r\ngovernment, to enter on a brilliant career, to influence the young \"by\r\nkindness,\" and to restrain them from extremes--all these dreams existed\r\nside by side in her fantastic brain. She had saved Pyotr Stepanovitch,\r\nshe had conquered him (of this she was for some reason firmly\r\nconvinced); she would save others. None, none of them should perish,\r\nshe should save them all; she would pick them out; she would send in\r\nthe right report of them; she would act in the interests of the loftiest\r\njustice, and perhaps posterity and Russian liberalism would bless her\r\nname; yet the conspiracy would be discovered.","Every advantage at once.\r\n\r\nStill it was essential that Andrey Antonovitch should be in rather\r\nbetter spirits before the festival. He must be cheered up and reassured.\r\nFor this purpose she sent Pyotr Stepanovitch to him in the hope that he\r\nwould relieve his depression by some means of consolation best known\r\nto himself, perhaps by giving him some information, so to speak, first\r\nhand. She put implicit faith in his dexterity.","It was some time since Pyotr Stepanovitch had been in Mr. von Lembke's\r\nstudy. He popped in on him just when the sufferer was in a most stubborn\r\nmood.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nA combination of circumstances had arisen which Mr. von Lembke was quite\r\nunable to deal with. In the very district where Pyotr Stepanovitch had\r\nbeen having a festive time a sub-lieutenant had been called up to be\r\ncensured by his immediate superior, and the reproof was given in the\r\npresence of the whole company.","The sub-lieutenant was a young man fresh\r\nfrom Petersburg, always silent and morose, of dignified appearance\r\nthough small, stout, and rosy-cheeked. He resented the reprimand and\r\nsuddenly, with a startling shriek that astonished the whole company,\r\nhe charged at his superior officer with his head bent down like a wild\r\nbeast's, struck him, and bit him on the shoulder with all his might;\r\nthey had difficulty in getting him off.","There was no doubt that he had\r\ngone out of his mind; anyway, it became known that of late he had been\r\nobserved performing incredibly strange actions. He had, for instance,\r\nflung two ikons belonging to his landlady out of his lodgings and\r\nsmashed up one of them with an axe; in his own room he had, on three\r\nstands resembling lecterns, laid out the works of Vogt, Moleschott, and\r\nBuchner, and before each lectern he used to burn a church wax-candle.","From the number of books found in his rooms it could be gathered that\r\nhe was a well-read man. If he had had fifty thousand francs he would\r\nperhaps have sailed to the island of Marquisas like the \"cadet\" to whom\r\nHerzen alludes with such sprightly humour in one of his writings. When\r\nhe was seized, whole bundles of the most desperate manifestoes were\r\nfound in his pockets and his lodgings.\r\n\r\nManifestoes are a trivial matter too, and to my thinking not worth\r\ntroubling about.","We have seen plenty of them. Besides, they were not\r\nnew manifestoes; they were, it was said later, just the same as had been\r\ncirculated in the X province, and Liputin, who had travelled in that\r\ndistrict and the neighbouring province six weeks previously, declared\r\nthat he had seen exactly the same leaflets there then. But what struck\r\nAndrey Antonovitch most was that the overseer of Shpigulin's factory had\r\nbrought the police just at the same time two or three packets of exactly\r\nthe same leaflets as had been found on the lieutenant.","The bundles,\r\nwhich had been dropped in the factory in the night, had not been opened,\r\nand none of the factory-hands had had time to read one of them. The\r\nincident was a trivial one, but it set Andrey Antonovitch pondering\r\ndeeply. The position presented itself to him in an unpleasantly\r\ncomplicated light.\r\n\r\nIn this factory the famous \"Shpigulin scandal\" was just then brewing,\r\nwhich made so much talk among us and got into the Petersburg and Moscow\r\npapers with all sorts of variations.","Three weeks previously one of the\r\nhands had fallen ill and died of Asiatic cholera; then several others\r\nwere stricken down. The whole town was in a panic, for the cholera was\r\ncoming nearer and nearer and had reached the neighbouring province.\r\nI may observe that satisfactory sanitary measures had been, so far as\r\npossible, taken to meet the unexpected guest. But the factory belonging\r\nto the Shpigulins, who were millionaires and well-connected people, had\r\nsomehow been overlooked.","And there was a sudden outcry from every one\r\nthat this factory was the hot-bed of infection, that the factory\r\nitself, and especially the quarters inhabited by the workpeople, were\r\nso inveterately filthy that even if cholera had not been in the\r\nneighbourhood there might well have been an outbreak there. Steps were\r\nimmediately taken, of course, and Andrey Antonovitch vigorously insisted\r\non their being carried out without delay within three weeks.","The factory\r\nwas cleansed, but the Shpigulins, for some unknown reason, closed it.\r\nOne of the Shpigulin brothers always lived in Petersburg and the other\r\nwent away to Moscow when the order was given for cleansing the factory.\r\nThe overseer proceeded to pay off the workpeople and, as it appeared,\r\ncheated them shamelessly. The hands began to complain among themselves,\r\nasking to be paid fairly, and foolishly went to the police, though\r\nwithout much disturbance, for they were not so very much excited.","It\r\nwas just at this moment that the manifestoes were brought to Andrey\r\nAntonovitch by the overseer.\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch popped into the study unannounced, like an intimate\r\nfriend and one of the family; besides, he had a message from Yulia\r\nMihailovna. Seeing him, Lembke frowned grimly and stood still at the\r\ntable without welcoming him. Till that moment he had been pacing up and\r\ndown the study and had been discussing something _t√™te-√†-t√™te_ with his\r\nclerk Blum, a very clumsy and surly German whom he had brought with him\r\nfrom Petersburg, in spite of the violent opposition of Yulia Mihailovna.","On Pyotr Stepanovitch's entrance the clerk had moved to the door, but\r\nhad not gone out. Pyotr Stepanovitch even fancied that he exchanged\r\nsignificant glances with his chief.\r\n\r\n\"Aha, I've caught you at last, you secretive monarch of the town!\" Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch cried out laughing, and laid his hand over the manifesto on\r\nthe table. \"This increases your collection, eh?\"\r\n\r\nAndrey Antonovitch flushed crimson; his face seemed to twitch.","\"Leave off, leave off at once!\" he cried, trembling with rage. \"And\r\ndon't you dare... sir...\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with you? You seem to be angry!\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to inform you, sir, that I've no intention of putting up with\r\nyour _sans fa√ßon_ henceforward, and I beg you to remember...\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, damn it all, he is in earnest!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue, hold your tongue\"--Von Lembke stamped on the\r\ncarpet--\"and don't dare.","..\"\r\n\r\nGod knows what it might have come to. Alas, there was one circumstance\r\ninvolved in the matter of which neither Pyotr Stepanovitch nor even\r\nYulia Mihailovna herself had any idea. The luckless Andrey Antonovitch\r\nhad been so greatly upset during the last few days that he had begun\r\nto be secretly jealous of his wife and Pyotr Stepanovitch. In solitude,\r\nespecially at night, he spent some very disagreeable moments.","\"Well, I imagined that if a man reads you his novel two days running\r\ntill after midnight and wants to hear your opinion of it, he has of his\r\nown act discarded official relations, anyway.... Yulia Mihailovna treats\r\nme as a friend; there's no making you out,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch brought\r\nout, with a certain dignity indeed. \"Here is your novel, by the way.\" He\r\nlaid on the table a large heavy manuscript rolled up in blue paper.","Lembke turned red and looked embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you find it?\" he asked discreetly, with a rush of joy which\r\nhe was unable to suppress, though he did his utmost to conceal it.\r\n\r\n\"Only fancy, done up like this, it rolled under the chest of drawers. I\r\nmust have thrown it down carelessly on the chest when I went out. It was\r\nonly found the day before yesterday, when the floor was scrubbed.","You\r\ndid set me a task, though!\"\r\n\r\nLembke dropped his eyes sternly.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't slept for the last two nights, thanks to you. It was found\r\nthe day before yesterday, but I kept it, and have been reading it ever\r\nsince. I've no time in the day, so I've read it at night. Well, I don't\r\nlike it; it's not my way of looking at things. But that's no matter;\r\nI've never set up for being a critic, but I couldn't tear myself away\r\nfrom it, my dear man, though I didn't like it! The fourth and fifth\r\nchapters are.",".. they really are... damn it all, they are beyond words!\r\nAnd what a lot of humour you've packed into it; it made me laugh! How\r\nyou can make fun of things _sans que cela paraisse!_ As for the ninth\r\nand tenth chapters, it's all about love; that's not my line, but it's\r\neffective though. I was nearly blubbering over Egrenev's letter, though\r\nyou've shown him up so cleverly.... You know, it's touching, though at\r\nthe same time you want to show the false side of him, as it were, don't\r\nyou? Have I guessed right? But I could simply beat you for the ending.","For what are you setting up? Why, the same old idol of domestic\r\nhappiness, begetting children and making money; 'they were married and\r\nlived happy ever afterwards'--come, it's too much! You will enchant your\r\nreaders, for even I couldn't put the book down; but that makes it all\r\nthe worse! The reading public is as stupid as ever, but it's the duty\r\nof sensible people to wake them up, while you.",".. But that's enough.\r\nGood-bye. Don't be cross another time; I came in to you because I had a\r\ncouple of words to say to you, but you are so unaccountable...\"\r\n\r\nAndrey Antonovitch meantime took his novel and locked it up in an oak\r\nbookcase, seizing the opportunity to wink to Blum to disappear. The\r\nlatter withdrew with a long, mournful face.\r\n\r\n\"I am not unaccountable, I am simply... nothing but annoyances,\" he\r\nmuttered, frowning but without anger, and sitting down to the table.","\"Sit down and say what you have to say. It's a long time since I've seen\r\nyou, Pyotr Stepanovitch, only don't burst upon me in the future with\r\nsuch manners... sometimes, when one has business, it's...\"\r\n\r\n\"My manners are always the same....\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, and I believe that you mean nothing by it, but sometimes one is\r\nworried.... Sit down.\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch immediately lolled back on the sofa and drew his legs\r\nunder him.","III\r\n\r\n\"What sort of worries? Surely not these trifles?\" He nodded towards the\r\nmanifesto. \"I can bring you as many of them as you like; I made their\r\nacquaintance in X province.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean at the time you were staying there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, it was not in my absence. I remember there was a hatchet\r\nprinted at the top of it. Allow me.\" (He took up the manifesto.) \"Yes,\r\nthere's the hatchet here too; that's it, the very same.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, here's a hatchet. You see, a hatchet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, is it the hatchet that scares you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it's not... and I am not scared; but this business... it is a\r\nbusiness; there are circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort? That it's come from the factory? He he! But do you know,\r\nat that factory the workpeople will soon be writing manifestoes for\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Von Lembke stared at him severely.","\"What I say. You've only to look at them. You are too soft, Andrey\r\nAntonovitch; you write novels. But this has to be handled in the good\r\nold way.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by the good old way? What do you mean by advising me?\r\nThe factory has been cleaned; I gave the order and they've cleaned it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the workmen are in rebellion. They ought to be flogged, every one\r\nof them; that would be the end of it.","\"\r\n\r\n\"In rebellion? That's nonsense; I gave the order and they've cleaned\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ech, you are soft, Andrey Antonovitch!\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, I am not so soft as you think, and in the second\r\nplace...\" Von Lembke was piqued again. He had exerted himself to keep\r\nup the conversation with the young man from curiosity, wondering if he\r\nwould tell him anything new.\r\n\r\n\"Ha ha, an old acquaintance again,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch interrupted,\r\npouncing on another document that lay under a paper-weight, something\r\nlike a manifesto, obviously printed abroad and in verse.","\"Oh, come, I\r\nknow this one by heart, 'A Noble Personality.' Let me have a look at\r\nit--yes, 'A Noble Personality' it is. I made acquaintance with that\r\npersonality abroad. Where did you unearth it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You say you've seen it abroad?\" Von Lembke said eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"I should think so, four months ago, or may be five.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to have seen a great deal abroad.\" Von Lembke looked at him\r\nsubtly.\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch, not heeding him, unfolded the document and read the\r\npoem aloud:\r\n\r\n\"A NOBLE PERSONALITY\r\n\r\n     \"He was not of rank exalted,\r\n     He was not of noble birth,\r\n     He was bred among the people\r\n     In the breast of Mother Earth.","But the malice of the nobles\r\n     And the Tsar's revengeful wrath\r\n     Drove him forth to grief and torture\r\n     On the martyr's chosen path.\r\n     He set out to teach the people\r\n     Freedom, love, equality,\r\n     To exhort them to resistance;\r\n     But to flee the penalty\r\n     Of the prison, whip and gallows,\r\n     To a foreign land he went.\r\n     While the people waited hoping\r\n     From Smolensk to far Tashkent,\r\n     Waited eager for his coming\r\n     To rebel against their fate,\r\n     To arise and crush the Tsardom\r\n     And the nobles' vicious hate,\r\n     To share all the wealth in common,\r\n     And the antiquated thrall\r\n     Of the church, the home and marriage\r\n     To abolish once for all.","\"\r\n\r\n\"You got it from that officer, I suppose, eh?\" asked Pyotr Stepanovitch.\r\n\r\n\"Why, do you know that officer, then, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think so. I had a gay time with him there for two days; he was\r\nbound to go out of his mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he did not go out of his mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think he didn't because he began to bite?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, excuse me, if you saw those verses abroad and then, it appears, at\r\nthat officer's.","..\"\r\n\r\n\"What, puzzling, is it? You are putting me through an examination,\r\nAndrey Antonovitch, I see. You see,\" he began suddenly with\r\nextraordinary dignity, \"as to what I saw abroad I have already given\r\nexplanations, and my explanations were found satisfactory, otherwise I\r\nshould not have been gratifying this town with my presence. I consider\r\nthat the question as regards me has been settled, and I am not obliged\r\nto give any further account of myself, not because I am an informer, but\r\nbecause I could not help acting as I did.","The people who wrote to Yulia\r\nMihailovna about me knew what they were talking about, and they said I\r\nwas an honest man.... But that's neither here nor there; I've come\r\nto see you about a serious matter, and it's as well you've sent\r\nyour chimney-sweep away. It's a matter of importance to me, Andrey\r\nAntonovitch. I shall have a very great favour to ask of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"A favour? H'm... by all means; I am waiting and, I confess, with\r\ncuriosity.","And I must add, Pyotr Stepanovitch, that you surprise me not\r\na little.\"\r\n\r\nVon Lembke was in some agitation. Pyotr Stepanovitch crossed his legs.\r\n\r\n\"In Petersburg,\" he began, \"I talked freely of most things, but there\r\nwere things--this, for instance\" (he tapped the \"Noble Personality\" with\r\nhis finger) \"about which I held my tongue--in the first place, because\r\nit wasn't worth talking about, and secondly, because I only answered\r\nquestions.","I don't care to put myself forward in such matters; in that\r\nI see the distinction between a rogue and an honest man forced by\r\ncircumstances. Well, in short, we'll dismiss that. But now... now that\r\nthese fools... now that this has come to the surface and is in your\r\nhands, and I see that you'll find out all about it--for you are a man\r\nwith eyes and one can't tell beforehand what you'll do--and these fools\r\nare still going on, I.",".. I... well, the fact is, I've come to ask you\r\nto save one man, a fool too, most likely mad, for the sake of his youth,\r\nhis misfortunes, in the name of your humanity.... You can't be so humane\r\nonly in the novels you manufacture!\" he said, breaking off with coarse\r\nsarcasm and impatience.\r\n\r\nIn fact, he was seen to be a straightforward man, awkward and\r\nimpolitic from excess of humane feeling and perhaps from excessive\r\nsensitiveness--above all, a man of limited intelligence, as Von Lembke\r\nsaw at once with extraordinary subtlety.","He had indeed long suspected\r\nit, especially when during the previous week he had, sitting alone\r\nin his study at night, secretly cursed him with all his heart for the\r\ninexplicable way in which he had gained Yulia Mihailovna's good graces.\r\n\r\n\"For whom are you interceding, and what does all this mean?\" he inquired\r\nmajestically, trying to conceal his curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"It... it's... damn it! It's not my fault that I trust you! Is it\r\nmy fault that I look upon you as a most honourable and, above all, a\r\nsensible man.",".. capable, that is, of understanding... damn...\"\r\n\r\nThe poor fellow evidently could not master his emotion.\r\n\r\n\"You must understand at last,\" he went on, \"you must understand that in\r\npronouncing his name I am betraying him to you--I am betraying him, am I\r\nnot? I am, am I not?\"\r\n\r\n\"But how am I to guess if you don't make up your mind to speak out?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just it; you always cut the ground from under one's feet with\r\nyour logic, damn it.","... Well, here goes... this 'noble personality,'\r\nthis 'student'... is Shatov... that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shatov? How do you mean it's Shatov?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shatov is the 'student' who is mentioned in this. He lives here, he was\r\nonce a serf, the man who gave that slap....\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, I know.\" Lembke screwed up his eyes. \"But excuse me, what is he\r\naccused of? Precisely and, above all, what is your petition?\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg you to save him, do you understand? I used to know him\r\neight years ago, I might almost say I was his friend,\" cried Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch, completely carried away.","\"But I am not bound to give you\r\nan account of my past life,\" he added, with a gesture of dismissal. \"All\r\nthis is of no consequence; it's the case of three men and a half, and\r\nwith those that are abroad you can't make up a dozen. But what I\r\nam building upon is your humanity and your intelligence. You will\r\nunderstand and you will put the matter in its true light, as the foolish\r\ndream of a man driven crazy.",".. by misfortunes, by continued misfortunes,\r\nand not as some impossible political plot or God knows what!\"\r\n\r\nHe was almost gasping for breath.\r\n\r\n\"H'm. I see that he is responsible for the manifestoes with the axe,\"\r\nLembke concluded almost majestically. \"Excuse me, though, if he were the\r\nonly person concerned, how could he have distributed it both here and\r\nin other districts and in the X province.",".. and, above all, where did he\r\nget them?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I tell you that at the utmost there are not more than five people\r\nin it--a dozen perhaps. How can I tell?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know?\"\r\n\r\n\"How should I know?--damn it all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you knew that Shatov was one of the conspirators.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ech!\" Pyotr Stepanovitch waved his hand as though to keep off the\r\noverwhelming penetration of the inquirer. \"Well, listen.","I'll tell you\r\nthe whole truth: of the manifestoes I know nothing--that is, absolutely\r\nnothing. Damn it all, don't you know what nothing means?... That\r\nsub-lieutenant, to be sure, and somebody else and someone else here...\r\nand Shatov perhaps and someone else too--well, that's the lot of\r\nthem... a wretched lot.... But I've come to intercede for Shatov. He\r\nmust be saved, for this poem is his, his own composition, and it was\r\nthrough him it was published abroad; that I know for a fact, but of the\r\nmanifestoes I really know nothing.","\"\r\n\r\n\"If the poem is his work, no doubt the manifestoes are too. But what\r\ndata have you for suspecting Mr. Shatov?\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch, with the air of a man driven out of all patience,\r\npulled a pocket-book out of his pocket and took a note out of it.\r\n\r\n\"Here are the facts,\" he cried, flinging it on the table.\r\n\r\nLembke unfolded it; it turned out to be a note written six months before\r\nfrom here to some address abroad.","It was a brief note, only two lines:\r\n\r\n\"I can't print 'A Noble Personality' here, and in fact I can do nothing;\r\nprint it abroad.\r\n                                                                                         \"Iv. Shatov.\"\r\n\r\nLembke looked intently at Pyotr Stepanovitch. Varvara Petrovna had been\r\nright in saying that he had at times the expression of a sheep.\r\n\r\n\"You see, it's like this,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch burst out.","\"He wrote this\r\npoem here six months ago, but he couldn't get it printed here, in a\r\nsecret printing press, and so he asks to have it printed abroad.... That\r\nseems clear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's clear, but to whom did he write? That's not clear yet,\"\r\nLembke observed with the most subtle irony.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Kirillov, of course; the letter was written to Kirillov\r\nabroad.... Surely you knew that? What's so annoying is that perhaps you\r\nare only putting it on before me, and most likely you knew all about\r\nthis poem and everything long ago! How did it come to be on your table?\r\nIt found its way there somehow! Why are you torturing me, if so?\"\r\n\r\nHe feverishly mopped his forehead with his handkerchief.","\"I know something, perhaps.\" Lembke parried dexterously. \"But who is\r\nthis Kirillov?\"\r\n\r\n\"An engineer who has lately come to the town. He was Stavrogin's second,\r\na maniac, a madman; your sub-lieutenant may really only be\r\nsuffering from temporary delirium, but Kirillov is a thoroughgoing\r\nmadman--thoroughgoing, that I guarantee. Ah, Andrey Antonovitch, if the\r\ngovernment only knew what sort of people these conspirators all are,\r\nthey wouldn't have the heart to lay a finger on them.","Every single\r\none of them ought to be in an asylum; I had a good look at them in\r\nSwitzerland and at the congresses.\"\r\n\r\n\"From which they direct the movement here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, who directs it? Three men and a half. It makes one sick to think\r\nof them. And what sort of movement is there here? Manifestoes! And what\r\nrecruits have they made? Sub-lieutenants in brain fever and two or three\r\nstudents! You are a sensible man: answer this question.","Why don't\r\npeople of consequence join their ranks? Why are they all students and\r\nhalf-baked boys of twenty-two? And not many of those. I dare say there\r\nare thousands of bloodhounds on their track, but have they tracked out\r\nmany of them? Seven! I tell you it makes one sick.\"\r\n\r\nLembke listened with attention but with an expression that seemed to\r\nsay, \"You don't feed nightingales on fairy-tales.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, though. You asserted that the letter was sent abroad, but\r\nthere's no address on it; how do you come to know that it was addressed\r\nto Mr. Kirillov and abroad too and... and... that it really was written\r\nby Mr. Shatov?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, fetch some specimen of Shatov's writing and compare it. You must\r\nhave some signature of his in your office. As for its being addressed to\r\nKirillov, it was Kirillov himself showed it me at the time.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you were yourself...\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I was, myself. They showed me lots of things out there. And\r\nas for this poem, they say it was written by Herzen to Shatov when he\r\nwas still wandering abroad, in memory of their meeting, so they say, by\r\nway of praise and recommendation--damn it all... and Shatov circulates\r\nit among the young people as much as to say, 'This was Herzen's opinion\r\nof me.","'\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha ha!\" cried Lembke, feeling he had got to the bottom of it at last.\r\n\"That's just what I was wondering: one can understand the manifesto, but\r\nwhat's the object of the poem?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you'd see it. Goodness knows why I've been babbling to you.\r\nListen. Spare Shatov for me and the rest may go to the devil--even\r\nKirillov, who is in hiding now, shut up in Filipov's house, where Shatov\r\nlodges too.","They don't like me because I've turned round... but promise\r\nme Shatov and I'll dish them all up for you. I shall be of use, Andrey\r\nAntonovitch! I reckon nine or ten men make up the whole wretched lot. I\r\nam keeping an eye on them myself, on my own account. We know of three\r\nalready: Shatov, Kirillov, and that sub-lieutenant. The others I am only\r\nwatching carefully... though I am pretty sharp-sighted too.","It's the\r\nsame over again as it was in the X province: two students, a schoolboy,\r\ntwo noblemen of twenty, a teacher, and a half-pay major of sixty, crazy\r\nwith drink, have been caught with manifestoes; that was all--you can\r\ntake my word for it, that was all; it was quite a surprise that that\r\nwas all. But I must have six days. I have reckoned it out--six days, not\r\nless. If you want to arrive at any result, don't disturb them for six\r\ndays and I can kill all the birds with one stone for you; but if you\r\nflutter them before, the birds will fly away.","But spare me Shatov. I\r\nspeak for Shatov.... The best plan would be to fetch him here secretly,\r\nin a friendly way, to your study and question him without disguising\r\nthe facts.... I have no doubt he'll throw himself at your feet and burst\r\ninto tears! He is a highly strung and unfortunate fellow; his wife\r\nis carrying on with Stavrogin. Be kind to him and he will tell you\r\neverything, but I must have six days.","... And, above all, above all, not\r\na word to Yulia Mihailovna. It's a secret. May it be a secret?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" cried Lembke, opening wide his eyes. \"Do you mean to say you\r\nsaid nothing of this to Yulia Mihailovna?\"\r\n\r\n\"To her? Heaven forbid! Ech, Andrey Antonovitch! You see, I value her\r\nfriendship and I have the highest respect for her... and all the rest of\r\nit... but I couldn't make such a blunder.","I don't contradict her, for,\r\nas you know yourself, it's dangerous to contradict her. I may have\r\ndropped a word to her, for I know she likes that, but to suppose that\r\nI mentioned names to her as I have to you or anything of that sort! My\r\ngood sir! Why am I appealing to you? Because you are a man, anyway,\r\na serious person with old-fashioned firmness and experience in the\r\nservice. You've seen life.","You must know by heart every detail of such\r\naffairs, I expect, from what you've seen in Petersburg. But if I were\r\nto mention those two names, for instance, to her, she'd stir up such a\r\nhubbub.... You know, she would like to astonish Petersburg. No, she's\r\ntoo hot-headed, she really is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she has something of that _fougue,_\" Andrey Antonovitch muttered\r\nwith some satisfaction, though at the same time he resented this\r\nunmannerly fellow's daring to express himself rather freely about Yulia\r\nMihailovna.","But Pyotr Stepanovitch probably imagined that he had not\r\ngone far enough and that he must exert himself further to flatter Lembke\r\nand make a complete conquest of him.\r\n\r\n\"_Fougue_ is just it,\" he assented. \"She may be a woman of genius, a\r\nliterary woman, but she would scare our sparrows. She wouldn't be\r\nable to keep quiet for six hours, let alone six days. Ech, Andrey\r\nAntonovitch, don't attempt to tie a woman down for six days! You do\r\nadmit that I have some experience--in this sort of thing, I mean; I know\r\nsomething about it, and you know that I may very well know something\r\nabout it.","I am not asking for six days for fun but with an object.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard...\" (Lembke hesitated to utter his thought) \"I have heard\r\nthat on your return from abroad you made some expression... as it were\r\nof repentance, in the proper quarter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's as it may be.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, of course, I don't want to go into it.... But it has seemed to\r\nme all along that you've talked in quite a different style--about the\r\nChristian faith, for instance, about social institutions, about the\r\ngovernment even.","...\"\r\n\r\n\"I've said lots of things, no doubt, I am saying them still; but such\r\nideas mustn't be applied as those fools do it, that's the point. What's\r\nthe good of biting his superior's shoulder! You agreed with me yourself,\r\nonly you said it was premature.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mean that when I agreed and said it was premature.\"\r\n\r\n\"You weigh every word you utter, though. He he! You are a careful man!\"\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch observed gaily all of a sudden.","\"Listen, old friend.\r\nI had to get to know you; that's why I talked in my own style. You are\r\nnot the only one I get to know like that. Maybe I needed to find out\r\nyour character.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's my character to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell what it may be to me?\" He laughed again. \"You see, my\r\ndear and highly respected Andrey Antonovitch, you are cunning, but\r\nit's not come to _that_ yet and it certainly never will come to it, you\r\nunderstand? Perhaps you do understand.","Though I did make an explanation\r\nin the proper quarter when I came back from abroad, and I really don't\r\nknow why a man of certain convictions should not be able to work for\r\nthe advancement of his sincere convictions... but nobody _there_ has yet\r\ninstructed me to investigate your character and I've not undertaken any\r\nsuch job from _them._ Consider: I need not have given those two names to\r\nyou.","I might have gone straight _there;_ that is where I made my first\r\nexplanations. And if I'd been acting with a view to financial profit or\r\nmy own interest in any way, it would have been a bad speculation on my\r\npart, for now they'll be grateful to you and not to me at headquarters.\r\nI've done it solely for Shatov's sake,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch added\r\ngenerously, \"for Shatov's sake, because of our old friendship.","... But\r\nwhen you take up your pen to write to headquarters, you may put in\r\na word for me, if you like.... I'll make no objection, he he! _Adieu,_\r\nthough; I've stayed too long and there was no need to gossip so much!\"\r\nhe added with some amiability, and he got up from the sofa.\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, I am very glad that the position has been defined, so\r\nto speak.\" Von Lembke too got up and he too looked pleasant, obviously\r\naffected by the last words.","\"I accept your services and acknowledge\r\nmy obligation, and you may be sure that anything I can do by way of\r\nreporting your zeal...\"\r\n\r\n\"Six days--the great thing is to put it off for six days, and that you\r\nshouldn't stir for those six days, that's what I want.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I don't tie your hands and shouldn't venture to. You are\r\nbound to keep watch, only don't flutter the nest too soon; I rely on\r\nyour sense and experience for that.","But I should think you've plenty\r\nof bloodhounds and trackers of your own in reserve, ha ha!\" Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch blurted out with the gaiety and irresponsibility of youth.\r\n\r\n\"Not quite so.\" Lembke parried amiably. \"Young people are apt to suppose\r\nthat there is a great deal in the background.... But, by the way, allow\r\nme one little word: if this Kirillov was Stavrogin's second, then Mr.\r\nStavrogin too.","..\"\r\n\r\n\"What about Stavrogin?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, if they are such friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, no, no! There you are quite out of it, though you are cunning.\r\nYou really surprise me. I thought that you had some information about\r\nit.... H'm... Stavrogin--it's quite the opposite, quite.... _Avis au\r\nlecteur.\"_\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean it? And can it be so?\" Lembke articulated mistrustfully.\r\n\"Yulia Mihailovna told me that from what she heard from Petersburg he is\r\na man acting on some sort of instructions, so to speak.","...\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing about it; I know nothing, absolutely nothing. _Adieu.\r\nAvis au lecteur!_\" Abruptly and obviously Pyotr Stepanovitch declined to\r\ndiscuss it.\r\n\r\nHe hurried to the door.\r\n\r\n\"Stay, Pyotr Stepanovitch, stay,\" cried Lembke. \"One other tiny matter\r\nand I won't detain you.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew an envelope out of a table drawer.\r\n\r\n\"Here is a little specimen of the same kind of thing, and I let you see\r\nit to show how completely I trust you.","Here, and tell me your opinion.\"\r\n\r\nIn the envelope was a letter, a strange anonymous letter addressed to\r\nLembke and only received by him the day before. With intense vexation\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch read as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Your excellency,--For such you are by rank. Herewith I make known that\r\nthere is an attempt to be made on the life of personages of general's\r\nrank and on the Fatherland. For it's working up straight for that.","I myself have been disseminating unceasingly for a number of years.\r\nThere's infidelity too. There's a rebellion being got up and there are\r\nsome thousands of manifestoes, and for every one of them there will be\r\na hundred running with their tongues out, unless they've been taken\r\naway beforehand by the police. For they've been promised a mighty lot of\r\nbenefits, and the simple people are foolish, and there's vodka too.","The\r\npeople will attack one after another, taking them to be guilty, and,\r\nfearing both sides, I repent of what I had no share in, my circumstances\r\nbeing what they are. If you want information to save the Fatherland,\r\nand also the Church and the ikons, I am the only one that can do it. But\r\nonly on condition that I get a pardon from the Secret Police by telegram\r\nat once, me alone, but the rest may answer for it.","Put a candle every\r\nevening at seven o'clock in the porter's window for a signal. Seeing it,\r\nI shall believe and come to kiss the merciful hand from Petersburg. But\r\non condition there's a pension for me, for else how am I to live? You\r\nwon't regret it for it will mean a star for you. You must go secretly\r\nor they'll wring your neck. Your excellency's desperate servant falls at\r\nyour feet.\r\n\r\n                \"Repentant free-thinker incognito.","\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVon Lembke explained that the letter had made its appearance in the\r\nporter's room when it was left empty the day before.\r\n\r\n\"So what do you think?\" Pyotr Stepanovitch asked almost rudely.\r\n\r\n\"I think it's an anonymous skit by way of a hoax.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most likely it is. There's no taking you in.\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes me think that is that it's so stupid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you received such documents here before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Once or twice, anonymous letters.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, of course they wouldn't be signed. In a different style? In\r\ndifferent handwritings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And were they buffoonery like this one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and you know... very disgusting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you had them before, it must be the same thing now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Especially because it's so stupid. Because these people are educated\r\nand wouldn't write so stupidly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what if this is someone who really wants to turn informer?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not very likely,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch rapped out dryly.","\"What\r\ndoes he mean by a telegram from the Secret Police and a pension? It's\r\nobviously a hoax.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" Lembke admitted, abashed.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you what: you leave this with me. I can certainly find out for\r\nyou before I track out the others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take it,\" Lembke assented, though with some hesitation.\r\n\r\n\"Have you shown it to anyone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it likely! No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to Yulia Mihailovna?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Heaven forbid! And for God's sake don't you show it her!\" Lembke\r\ncried in alarm.","\"She'll be so upset... and will be dreadfully angry with\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you'll be the first to catch it; she'd say you brought it on\r\nyourself if people write like that to you. I know what women's logic is.\r\nWell, good-bye. I dare say I shall bring you the writer in a couple of\r\ndays or so. Above all, our compact!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThough Pyotr Stepanovitch was perhaps far from being a stupid man, Fedka\r\nthe convict had said of him truly \"that he would make up a man himself\r\nand go on living with him too.","\" He came away from Lembke fully persuaded\r\nthat for the next six days, anyway, he had put his mind at rest, and\r\nthis interval was absolutely necessary for his own purposes. But it was\r\na false idea and founded entirely on the fact that he had made up for\r\nhimself once for all an Andrey Antonovitch who was a perfect simpleton.\r\n\r\nLike every morbidly suspicious man, Andrey Antonovitch was always\r\nexceedingly and joyfully trustful the moment he got on to sure ground.","The new turn of affairs struck him at first in a rather favourable light\r\nin spite of some fresh and troublesome complications. Anyway, his former\r\ndoubts fell to the ground. Besides, he had been so tired for the last\r\nfew days, so exhausted and helpless, that his soul involuntarily yearned\r\nfor rest. But alas! he was again uneasy. The long time he had spent in\r\nPetersburg had left ineradicable traces in his heart.","The official and\r\neven the secret history of the \"younger generation\" was fairly familiar\r\nto him--he was a curious man and used to collect manifestoes--but he\r\ncould never understand a word of it. Now he felt like a man lost in\r\na forest. Every instinct told him that there was something in Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch's words utterly incongruous, anomalous, and grotesque,\r\n\"though there's no telling what may not happen with this 'younger\r\ngeneration,' and the devil only knows what's going on among them,\" he\r\nmused, lost in perplexity.","And at this moment, to make matters worse, Blum poked his head in. He\r\nhad been waiting not far off through the whole of Pyotr Stepanovitch's\r\nvisit. This Blum was actually a distant relation of Andrey Antonovitch,\r\nthough the relationship had always been carefully and timorously\r\nconcealed. I must apologise to the reader for devoting a few words here\r\nto this insignificant person. Blum was one of that strange class of\r\n\"unfortunate\" Germans who are unfortunate not through lack of ability\r\nbut through some inexplicable ill luck.","\"Unfortunate\" Germans are not\r\na myth, but really do exist even in Russia, and are of a special type.\r\nAndrey Antonovitch had always had a quite touching sympathy for him, and\r\nwherever he could, as he rose himself in the service, had promoted him\r\nto subordinate positions under him; but Blum had never been successful.\r\nEither the post was abolished after he had been appointed to it, or a\r\nnew chief took charge of the department; once he was almost arrested by\r\nmistake with other people.","He was precise, but he was gloomy to excess\r\nand to his own detriment. He was tall and had red hair; he stooped and\r\nwas depressed and even sentimental; and in spite of his being humbled by\r\nhis life, he was obstinate and persistent as an ox, though always at\r\nthe wrong moment. For Andrey Antonovitch he, as well as his wife and\r\nnumerous family, had cherished for many years a reverent devotion.\r\nExcept Andrey Antonovitch no one had ever liked him.","Yulia Mihailovna\r\nwould have discarded him from the first, but could not overcome her\r\nhusband's obstinacy. It was the cause of their first conjugal quarrel.\r\nIt had happened soon after their marriage, in the early days of their\r\nhoneymoon, when she was confronted with Blum, who, together with the\r\nhumiliating secret of his relationship, had been until then carefully\r\nconcealed from her. Andrey Antonovitch besought her with clasped hands,\r\ntold her pathetically all the story of Blum and their friendship from\r\nchildhood, but Yulia Mihailovna considered herself disgraced forever,\r\nand even had recourse to fainting.","Von Lembke would not budge an\r\ninch, and declared that he would not give up Blum or part from him for\r\nanything in the world, so that she was surprised at last and was obliged\r\nto put up with Blum. It was settled, however, that the relationship\r\nshould be concealed even more carefully than before if possible, and\r\nthat even Blum's Christian name and patronymic should be changed,\r\nbecause he too was for some reason called Andrey Antonovitch.","Blum knew\r\nno one in the town except the German chemist, had not called on anyone,\r\nand led, as he always did, a lonely and niggardly existence. He had\r\nlong been aware of Andrey Antonovitch's literary peccadilloes. He was\r\ngenerally summoned to listen to secret _t√™te-√†-t√™te_ readings of his\r\nnovel; he would sit like a post for six hours at a stretch, perspiring\r\nand straining his utmost to keep awake and smile.","On reaching home he\r\nwould groan with his long-legged and lanky wife over their benefactor's\r\nunhappy weakness for Russian literature.\r\n\r\nAndrey Antonovitch looked with anguish at Blum.\r\n\r\n\"I beg you to leave me alone, Blum,\" he began with agitated haste,\r\nobviously anxious to avoid any renewal of the previous conversation\r\nwhich had been interrupted by Pyotr Stepanovitch.\r\n\r\n\"And yet this may be arranged in the most delicate way and with no\r\npublicity; you have full power.","\" Blum respectfully but obstinately\r\ninsisted on some point, stooping forward and coming nearer and nearer by\r\nsmall steps to Andrey Antonovitch.\r\n\r\n\"Blum, you are so devoted to me and so anxious to serve me that I am\r\nalways in a panic when I look at you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You always say witty things, and sleep in peace satisfied with what\r\nyou've said, but that's how you damage yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blum, I have just convinced myself that it's quite a mistake, quite a\r\nmistake.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Not from the words of that false, vicious young man whom you suspect\r\nyourself? He has won you by his flattering praise of your talent for\r\nliterature.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blum, you understand nothing about it; your project is absurd, I\r\ntell you. We shall find nothing and there will be a fearful upset and\r\nlaughter too, and then Yulia Mihailovna...\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall certainly find everything we are looking for.","\" Blum advanced\r\nfirmly towards him, laying his right hand on his heart. \"We will make\r\na search suddenly early in the morning, carefully showing every\r\nconsideration for the person himself and strictly observing all the\r\nprescribed forms of the law. The young men, Lyamshin and Telyatnikov,\r\nassert positively that we shall find all we want. They were constant\r\nvisitors there. Nobody is favourably disposed to Mr.","Verhovensky. Madame\r\nStavrogin has openly refused him her graces, and every honest man, if\r\nonly there is such a one in this coarse town, is persuaded that a hotbed\r\nof infidelity and social doctrines has always been concealed there. He\r\nkeeps all the forbidden books, Ryliev's 'Reflections,' all Herzen's\r\nworks.... I have an approximate catalogue, in case of need.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh heavens! Every one has these books; how simple you are, my poor\r\nBlum.","\"\r\n\r\n\"And many manifestoes,\" Blum went on without heeding the observation.\r\n\"We shall end by certainly coming upon traces of the real manifestoes\r\nhere. That young Verhovensky I feel very suspicious of.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are mixing up the father and the son. They are not on good\r\nterms. The son openly laughs at his father.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's only a mask.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blum, you've sworn to torment me! Think! he is a conspicuous figure\r\nhere, after all.","He's been a professor, he is a well-known man. He'll\r\nmake such an uproar and there will be such gibes all over the town, and\r\nwe shall make a mess of it all.... And only think how Yulia Mihailovna\r\nwill take it.\" Blum pressed forward and did not listen. \"He was only a\r\nlecturer, only a lecturer, and of a low rank when he retired.\" He smote\r\nhimself on the chest. \"He has no marks of distinction. He was discharged\r\nfrom the service on suspicion of plots against the government.","He has\r\nbeen under secret supervision, and undoubtedly still is so. And in view\r\nof the disorders that have come to light now, you are undoubtedly bound\r\nin duty. You are losing your chance of distinction by letting slip the\r\nreal criminal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yulia Mihailovna! Get away, Blum,\" Von Lembke cried suddenly, hearing\r\nthe voice of his spouse in the next room. Blum started but did not give\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me, allow me,\" he persisted, pressing both hands still more\r\ntightly on his chest.","\"Get away!\" hissed Andrey Antonovitch. \"Do what you like... afterwards.\r\nOh, my God!\"\r\n\r\nThe curtain was raised and Yulia Mihailovna made her appearance. She\r\nstood still majestically at the sight of Blum, casting a haughty and\r\noffended glance at him, as though the very presence of this man was an\r\naffront to her. Blum respectfully made her a deep bow without speaking\r\nand, doubled up with veneration, moved towards the door on tiptoe with\r\nhis arms held a little away from him.","Either because he really took Andrey Antonovitch's last hysterical\r\noutbreak as a direct permission to act as he was asking, or whether\r\nhe strained a point in this case for the direct advantage of his\r\nbenefactor, because he was too confident that success would crown his\r\nefforts; anyway, as we shall see later on, this conversation of the\r\ngovernor with his subordinate led to a very surprising event which\r\namused many people, became public property, moved Yulia Mihailovna to\r\nfierce anger, utterly disconcerting Andrey Antonovitch and reducing him\r\nat the crucial moment to a state of deplorable indecision.","V\r\n\r\nIt was a busy day for Pyotr Stepanovitch. From Von Lembke he hastened to\r\nBogoyavlensky Street, but as he went along Bykovy Street, past the house\r\nwhere Karmazinov was staying, he suddenly stopped, grinned, and\r\nwent into the house. The servant told him that he was expected, which\r\ninterested him, as he had said nothing beforehand of his coming.\r\n\r\nBut the great writer really had been expecting him, not only that day\r\nbut the day before and the day before that.","Three days before he had\r\nhanded him his manuscript _Merci_ (which he had meant to read at the\r\nliterary matin√©e at Yulia Mihailovna's f√™te). He had done this out of\r\namiability, fully convinced that he was agreeably flattering the young\r\nman's vanity by letting him read the great work beforehand. Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch had noticed long before that this vainglorious, spoiled\r\ngentleman, who was so offensively unapproachable for all but the elect,\r\nthis writer \"with the intellect of a statesman,\" was simply trying\r\nto curry favour with him, even with avidity.","I believe the young man\r\nguessed at last that Karmazinov considered him, if not the leader of\r\nthe whole secret revolutionary movement in Russia, at least one of those\r\nmost deeply initiated into the secrets of the Russian revolution who had\r\nan incontestable influence on the younger generation. The state of mind\r\nof \"the cleverest man in Russia\" interested Pyotr Stepanovitch, but\r\nhitherto he had, for certain reasons, avoided explaining himself.","The great writer was staying in the house belonging to his sister, who\r\nwas the wife of a _kammerherr_ and had an estate in the neighbourhood.\r\nBoth she and her husband had the deepest reverence for their illustrious\r\nrelation, but to their profound regret both of them happened to be in\r\nMoscow at the time of his visit, so that the honour of receiving him\r\nfell to the lot of an old lady, a poor relation of the _kammerherr's,_ who\r\nhad for years lived in the family and looked after the housekeeping.","All\r\nthe household had moved about on tiptoe since Karmazinov's arrival. The\r\nold lady sent news to Moscow almost every day, how he had slept, what he\r\nhad deigned to eat, and had once sent a telegram to announce that after\r\na dinner-party at the mayor's he was obliged to take a spoonful of a\r\nwell-known medicine. She rarely plucked up courage to enter his room,\r\nthough he behaved courteously to her, but dryly, and only talked to her\r\nof what was necessary.","When Pyotr Stepanovitch came in, he was eating his morning cutlet with\r\nhalf a glass of red wine. Pyotr Stepanovitch had been to see him before\r\nand always found him eating this cutlet, which he finished in his\r\npresence without ever offering him anything. After the cutlet a little\r\ncup of coffee was served. The footman who brought in the dishes wore a\r\nswallow-tail coat, noiseless boots, and gloves.","\"Ha ha!\" Karmazinov got up from the sofa, wiping his mouth with a\r\ntable-napkin, and came forward to kiss him with an air of unmixed\r\ndelight--after the characteristic fashion of Russians if they are very\r\nillustrious. But Pyotr Stepanovitch knew by experience that, though\r\nKarmazinov made a show of kissing him, he really only proffered his\r\ncheek, and so this time he did the same: the cheeks met.","Karmazinov did\r\nnot show that he noticed it, sat down on the sofa, and affably offered\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch an easy chair facing him, in which the latter\r\nstretched himself at once.\r\n\r\n\"You don't... wouldn't like some lunch?\" inquired Karmazinov, abandoning\r\nhis usual habit but with an air, of course, which would prompt a polite\r\nrefusal. Pyotr Stepanovitch at once expressed a desire for lunch. A\r\nshade of offended surprise darkened the face of his host, but only for\r\nan instant; he nervously rang for the servant and, in spite of all his\r\nbreeding, raised his voice scornfully as he gave orders for a second\r\nlunch to be served.","\"What will you have, cutlet or coffee?\" he asked once more.\r\n\r\n\"A cutlet and coffee, and tell him to bring some more wine, I am\r\nhungry,\" answered Pyotr Stepanovitch, calmly scrutinising his host's\r\nattire. Mr. Karmazinov was wearing a sort of indoor wadded jacket with\r\npearl buttons, but it was too short, which was far from becoming to his\r\nrather comfortable stomach and the solid curves of his hips.","But tastes\r\ndiffer. Over his knees he had a checkered woollen plaid reaching to the\r\nfloor, though it was warm in the room.\r\n\r\n\"Are you unwell?\" commented Pyotr Stepanovitch.\r\n\r\n\"No, not unwell, but I am afraid of being so in this climate,\" answered\r\nthe writer in his squeaky voice, though he uttered each word with a soft\r\ncadence and agreeable gentlemanly lisp. \"I've been expecting you since\r\nyesterday.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? I didn't say I'd come.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but you have my manuscript. Have you... read it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Manuscript? Which one?\"\r\n\r\nKarmazinov was terribly surprised.\r\n\r\n\"But you've brought it with you, haven't you?\" He was so disturbed that\r\nhe even left off eating and looked at Pyotr Stepanovitch with a face of\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that _Bonjour_ you mean....\"\r\n\r\n_\"Merci.\"_\r\n\r\n\"Oh, all right. I'd quite forgotten it and hadn't read it; I haven't had\r\ntime.","I really don't know, it's not in my pockets... it must be on my\r\ntable. Don't be uneasy, it will be found.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'd better send to your rooms at once. It might be lost; besides,\r\nit might be stolen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, who'd want it! But why are you so alarmed? Why, Yulia Mihailovna\r\ntold me you always have several copies made--one kept at a notary's\r\nabroad, another in Petersburg, a third in Moscow, and then you send some\r\nto a bank, I believe.","\"\r\n\r\n\"But Moscow might be burnt again and my manuscript with it. No, I'd\r\nbetter send at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay, here it is!\" Pyotr Stepanovitch pulled a roll of note-paper\r\nout of a pocket at the back of his coat. \"It's a little crumpled. Only\r\nfancy, it's been lying there with my pocket-handkerchief ever since I\r\ntook it from you; I forgot it.\"\r\n\r\nKarmazinov greedily snatched the manuscript, carefully examined it,\r\ncounted the pages, and laid it respectfully beside him on a special\r\ntable, for the time, in such a way that he would not lose sight of it\r\nfor an instant.","\"You don't read very much, it seems?\" he hissed, unable to restrain\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"No, not very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"And nothing in the way of Russian literature?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the way of Russian literature? Let me see, I have read\r\nsomething.... 'On the Way' or 'Away!' or 'At the Parting of the Ways'--\r\nsomething of the sort; I don't remember. It's a long time since I read\r\nit, five years ago. I've no time.\"\r\n\r\nA silence followed.","\"When I came I assured every one that you were a very intelligent man,\r\nand now I believe every one here is wild over you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch answered calmly.\r\n\r\nLunch was brought in. Pyotr Stepanovitch pounced on the cutlet with\r\nextraordinary appetite, had eaten it in a trice, tossed off the wine and\r\nswallowed his coffee.\r\n\r\n\"This boor,\" thought Karmazinov, looking at him askance as he munched\r\nthe last morsel and drained the last drops--\"this boor probably\r\nunderstood the biting taunt in my words.",".. and no doubt he has read\r\nthe manuscript with eagerness; he is simply lying with some object. But\r\npossibly he is not lying and is only genuinely stupid. I like a genius\r\nto be rather stupid. Mayn't he be a sort of genius among them? Devil\r\ntake the fellow!\"\r\n\r\nHe got up from the sofa and began pacing from one end of the room to the\r\nother for the sake of exercise, as he always did after lunch.\r\n\r\n\"Leaving here soon?\" asked Pyotr Stepanovitch from his easy chair,\r\nlighting a cigarette.","\"I really came to sell an estate and I am in the hands of my bailiff.\"\r\n\r\n\"You left, I believe, because they expected an epidemic out there after\r\nthe war?\"\r\n\r\n\"N-no, not entirely for that reason,\" Mr. Karmazinov went on, uttering\r\nhis phrases with an affable intonation, and each time he turned round in\r\npacing the corner there was a faint but jaunty quiver of his right leg.\r\n\"I certainly intend to live as long as I can.","\" He laughed, not without\r\nvenom. \"There is something in our Russian nobility that makes them wear\r\nout very quickly, from every point of view. But I wish to wear out as\r\nlate as possible, and now I am going abroad for good; there the climate\r\nis better, the houses are of stone, and everything stronger. Europe will\r\nlast my time, I think. What do you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell?\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm. If the Babylon out there really does fall, and great will be the\r\nfall thereof (about which I quite agree with you, yet I think it will\r\nlast my time), there's nothing to fall here in Russia, comparatively\r\nspeaking.","There won't be stones to fall, everything will crumble into\r\ndirt. Holy Russia has less power of resistance than anything in the\r\nworld. The Russian peasantry is still held together somehow by the\r\nRussian God; but according to the latest accounts the Russian God is not\r\nto be relied upon, and scarcely survived the emancipation; it certainly\r\ngave Him a severe shock. And now, what with railways, what with you.","..\r\nI've no faith in the Russian God.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how about the European one?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe in any. I've been slandered to the youth of Russia.\r\nI've always sympathised with every movement among them. I was shown the\r\nmanifestoes here. Every one looks at them with perplexity because they\r\nare frightened at the way things are put in them, but every one is\r\nconvinced of their power even if they don't admit it to themselves.","Everybody has been rolling downhill, and every one has known for ages\r\nthat they have nothing to clutch at. I am persuaded of the success of\r\nthis mysterious propaganda, if only because Russia is now pre-eminently\r\nthe place in all the world where anything you like may happen without\r\nany opposition. I understand only too well why wealthy Russians all\r\nflock abroad, and more and more so every year.","It's simply instinct. If\r\nthe ship is sinking, the rats are the first to leave it. Holy Russia is\r\na country of wood, of poverty... and of danger, the country of ambitious\r\nbeggars in its upper classes, while the immense majority live in poky\r\nlittle huts. She will be glad of any way of escape; you have only to\r\npresent it to her. It's only the government that still means to\r\nresist, but it brandishes its cudgel in the dark and hits its own men.","Everything here is doomed and awaiting the end. Russia as she is has no\r\nfuture. I have become a German and I am proud of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you began about the manifestoes. Tell me everything; how do you\r\nlook at them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Every one is afraid of them, so they must be influential. They openly\r\nunmask what is false and prove that there is nothing to lay hold of\r\namong us, and nothing to lean upon. They speak aloud while all is\r\nsilent.","What is most effective about them (in spite of their style) is\r\nthe incredible boldness with which they look the truth straight in the\r\nface. To look facts straight in the face is only possible to Russians of\r\nthis generation. No, in Europe they are not yet so bold; it is a realm\r\nof stone, there there is still something to lean upon. So far as I see\r\nand am able to judge, the whole essence of the Russian revolutionary\r\nidea lies in the negation of honour.","I like its being so boldly and\r\nfearlessly expressed. No, in Europe they wouldn't understand it yet, but\r\nthat's just what we shall clutch at. For a Russian a sense of honour is\r\nonly a superfluous burden, and it always has been a burden through all\r\nhis history. The open 'right to dishonour' will attract him more than\r\nanything. I belong to the older generation and, I must confess, still\r\ncling to honour, but only from habit.","It is only that I prefer the old\r\nforms, granted it's from timidity; you see one must live somehow what's\r\nleft of one's life.\"\r\n\r\nHe suddenly stopped.\r\n\r\n\"I am talking,\" he thought, \"while he holds his tongue and watches me.\r\nHe has come to make me ask him a direct question. And I shall ask him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yulia Mihailovna asked me by some stratagem to find out from you what\r\nthe surprise is that you are preparing for the ball to-morrow,\" Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch asked suddenly.","\"Yes, there really will be a surprise and I certainly shall\r\nastonish...\" said Karmazinov with increased dignity. \"But I won't tell\r\nyou what the secret is.\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch did not insist.\r\n\r\n\"There is a young man here called Shatov,\" observed the great writer.\r\n\"Would you believe it, I haven't seen him.\"\r\n\r\n\"A very nice person. What about him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing. He talks about something.","Isn't he the person who gave\r\nStavrogin that slap in the face?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what's your opinion of Stavrogin?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know; he is such a flirt.\"\r\n\r\nKarmazinov detested Stavrogin because it was the latter's habit not to\r\ntake any notice of him.\r\n\r\n\"That flirt,\" he said, chuckling, \"if what is advocated in your\r\nmanifestoes ever comes to pass, will be the first to be hanged.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps before,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch said suddenly.","\"Quite right too,\" Karmazinov assented, not laughing, and with\r\npronounced gravity.\r\n\r\n\"You have said so once before, and, do you know, I repeated it to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, you surely didn't repeat it?\" Karmazinov laughed again.\r\n\r\n\"He said that if he were to be hanged it would be enough for you to\r\nbe flogged, not simply as a complement but to hurt, as they flog the\r\npeasants.\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch took his hat and got up from his seat.","Karmazinov\r\nheld out both hands to him at parting.\r\n\r\n\"And what if all that you are... plotting for is destined to come\r\nto pass...\" he piped suddenly, in a honeyed voice with a peculiar\r\nintonation, still holding his hands in his. \"How soon could it come\r\nabout?\"\r\n\r\n\"How could I tell?\" Pyotr Stepanovitch answered rather roughly. They\r\nlooked intently into each other's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"At a guess? Approximately?\" Karmazinov piped still more sweetly.","\"You'll have time to sell your estate and time to clear out too,\" Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch muttered still more roughly. They looked at one another\r\neven more intently.\r\n\r\nThere was a minute of silence.\r\n\r\n\"It will begin early next May and will be over by October,\" Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch said suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you sincerely,\" Karmazinov pronounced in a voice saturated with\r\nfeeling, pressing his hands.","\"You will have time to get out of the ship, you rat,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\nwas thinking as he went out into the street. \"Well, if that 'imperial\r\nintellect' inquires so confidently of the day and the hour and thanks\r\nme so respectfully for the information I have given, we mustn't doubt\r\nof ourselves. [He grinned.] H'm! But he really isn't stupid... and he is\r\nsimply a rat escaping; men like that don't tell tales!\"\r\n\r\nHe ran to Filipov's house in Bogoyavlensky Street.","VI\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch went first to Kirillov's. He found him, as usual,\r\nalone, and at the moment practising gymnastics, that is, standing with\r\nhis legs apart, brandishing his arms above his head in a peculiar way.\r\nOn the floor lay a ball. The tea stood cold on the table, not cleared\r\nsince breakfast. Pyotr Stepanovitch stood for a minute on the threshold.\r\n\r\n\"You are very anxious about your health, it seems,\" he said in a loud\r\nand cheerful tone, going into the room.","\"What a jolly ball, though; foo,\r\nhow it bounces! Is that for gymnastics too?\"\r\n\r\nKirillov put on his coat.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's for the good of my health too,\" he muttered dryly. \"Sit\r\ndown.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm only here for a minute. Still, I'll sit down. Health is all very\r\nwell, but I've come to remind you of our agreement. The appointed time\r\nis approaching... in a certain sense,\" he concluded awkwardly.\r\n\r\n\"What agreement?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you ask?\" Pyotr Stepanovitch was startled and even dismayed.","\"It's not an agreement and not an obligation. I have not bound myself in\r\nany way; it's a mistake on your part.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, what's this you're doing?\" Pyotr Stepanovitch jumped up.\r\n\r\n\"What I choose.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you choose?\"\r\n\r\n\"The same as before.\"\r\n\r\n\"How am I to understand that? Does that mean that you are in the same\r\nmind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Only there's no agreement and never has been, and I have not bound\r\nmyself in any way.","I could do as I like and I can still do as I like.\"\r\n\r\nKirillov explained himself curtly and contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\"I agree, I agree; be as free as you like if you don't change your\r\nmind.\" Pyotr Stepanovitch sat down again with a satisfied air. \"You are\r\nangry over a word. You've become very irritable of late; that's why\r\nI've avoided coming to see you. I was quite sure, though, you would be\r\nloyal.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I dislike you very much, but you can be perfectly sure--though I don't\r\nregard it as loyalty and disloyalty.\"\r\n\r\n\"But do you know\" (Pyotr Stepanovitch was startled again) \"we must talk\r\nthings over thoroughly again so as not to get in a muddle. The business\r\nneeds accuracy, and you keep giving me such shocks. Will you let me\r\nspeak?\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak,\" snapped Kirillov, looking away.\r\n\r\n\"You made up your mind long ago to take your life.",".. I mean, you had the\r\nidea in your mind. Is that the right expression? Is there any mistake\r\nabout that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have the same idea still.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent. Take note that no one has forced it on you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather not; what nonsense you talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say I express it very stupidly. Of course, it would be very\r\nstupid to force anybody to it. I'll go on. You were a member of the\r\nsociety before its organisation was changed, and confessed it to one of\r\nthe members.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't confess it, I simply said so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. And it would be absurd to confess such a thing. What a\r\nconfession! You simply said so. Excellent.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it's not excellent, for you are being tedious. I am not obliged to\r\ngive you any account of myself and you can't understand my ideas. I want\r\nto put an end to my life, because that's my idea, because I don't want\r\nto be afraid of death, because.",".. because there's no need for you to\r\nknow. What do you want? Would you like tea? It's cold. Let me get you\r\nanother glass.\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch actually had taken up the teapot and was looking for\r\nan empty glass. Kirillov went to the cupboard and brought a clean glass.\r\n\r\n\"I've just had lunch at Karmazinov's,\" observed his visitor, \"then\r\nI listened to him talking, and perspired and got into a sweat again\r\nrunning here.","I am fearfully thirsty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Drink. Cold tea is good.\"\r\n\r\nKirillov sat down on his chair again and again fixed his eyes on the\r\nfarthest corner.\r\n\r\n\"The idea had arisen in the society,\" he went on in the same voice,\r\n\"that I might be of use if I killed myself, and that when you get up\r\nsome bit of mischief here, and they are looking for the guilty, I might\r\nsuddenly shoot myself and leave a letter saying I did it all, so that\r\nyou might escape suspicion for another year.","\"\r\n\r\n\"For a few days, anyway; one day is precious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. So for that reason they asked me, if I would, to wait. I said I'd\r\nwait till the society fixed the day, because it makes no difference to\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but remember that you bound yourself not to make up your last\r\nletter without me and that in Russia you would be at my... well, at\r\nmy disposition, that is for that purpose only. I need hardly say, in\r\neverything else, of course, you are free,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch added\r\nalmost amiably.","\"I didn't bind myself, I agreed, because it makes no difference to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good, good. I have no intention of wounding your vanity, but...\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not a question of vanity.\"\r\n\r\n\"But remember that a hundred and twenty thalers were collected for your\r\njourney, so you've taken money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all.\" Kirillov fired up. \"The money was not on that condition.\r\nOne doesn't take money for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"People sometimes do.","\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a lie. I sent a letter from Petersburg, and in Petersburg I paid\r\nyou a hundred and twenty thalers; I put it in your hand... and it has\r\nbeen sent off there, unless you've kept it for yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, all right, I don't dispute anything; it has been sent off.\r\nAll that matters is that you are still in the same mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly the same. When you come and tell me it's time, I'll carry it\r\nall out.","Will it be very soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very many days.... But remember, we'll make up the letter together,\r\nthe same night.\"\r\n\r\n\"The same day if you like. You say I must take the responsibility for\r\nthe manifestoes on myself?\"\r\n\r\n\"And something else too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not going to make myself out responsible for everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"What won't you be responsible for?\" said Pyotr Stepanovitch again.\r\n\r\n\"What I don't choose; that's enough.","I don't want to talk about it any\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch controlled himself and changed the subject.\r\n\r\n\"To speak of something else,\" he began, \"will you be with us this\r\nevening? It's Virginsky's name-day; that's the pretext for our meeting.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do me a favour. Do come. You must. We must impress them by our number\r\nand our looks. You have a face... well, in one word, you have a fateful\r\nface.","\"\r\n\r\n\"You think so?\" laughed Kirillov. \"Very well, I'll come, but not for the\r\nsake of my face. What time is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, quite early, half-past six. And, you know, you can go in, sit down,\r\nand not speak to any one, however many there may be there. Only, I say,\r\ndon't forget to bring pencil and paper with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it makes no difference to you, and it's my special request.","You'll\r\nonly have to sit still, speaking to no one, listen, and sometimes seem\r\nto make a note. You can draw something, if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"What nonsense! What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, since it makes no difference to you! You keep saying that it's\r\njust the same to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, what for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, because that member of the society, the inspector, has stopped at\r\nMoscow and I told some of them here that possibly the inspector may turn\r\nup to-night; and they'll think that you are the inspector.","And as you've\r\nbeen here three weeks already, they'll be still more surprised.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stage tricks. You haven't got an inspector in Moscow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, suppose I haven't--damn him!--what business is that of yours\r\nand what bother will it be to you? You are a member of the society\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell them I am the inspector; I'll sit still and hold my tongue, but I\r\nwon't have the pencil and paper.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to.","\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch was really angry; he turned positively green, but\r\nagain he controlled himself. He got up and took his hat.\r\n\r\n\"Is that fellow with you?\" he brought out suddenly, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's good. I'll soon get him away. Don't be uneasy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not uneasy. He is only here at night. The old woman is in the\r\nhospital, her daughter-in-law is dead. I've been alone for the last two\r\ndays.","I've shown him the place in the paling where you can take a board\r\nout; he gets through, no one sees.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll take him away soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"He says he has got plenty of places to stay the night in.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's rot; they are looking for him, but here he wouldn't be noticed.\r\nDo you ever get into talk with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, at night. He abuses you tremendously. I've been reading the\r\n'Apocalypse' to him at night, and we have tea.","He listened eagerly, very\r\neagerly, the whole night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hang it all, you'll convert him to Christianity!\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a Christian as it is. Don't be uneasy, he'll do the murder. Whom\r\ndo you want to murder?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't want him for that, I want him for something different....\r\nAnd does Shatov know about Fedka?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't talk to Shatov, and I don't see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he angry?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we are not angry, only we shun one another.","We lay too long side by\r\nside in America.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to him directly.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stavrogin and I may come and see you from there, about ten o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to talk to him about something important.... I say, make me\r\na present of your ball; what do you want with it now? I want it for\r\ngymnastics too. I'll pay you for it if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can take it without.\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch put the ball in the back pocket of his coat.","\"But I'll give you nothing against Stavrogin,\" Kirillov muttered after\r\nhis guest, as he saw him out. The latter looked at him in amazement but\r\ndid not answer.\r\n\r\nKirillov's last words perplexed Pyotr Stepanovitch extremely; he had not\r\ntime yet to discover their meaning, but even while he was on the stairs\r\nof Shatov's lodging he tried to remove all trace of annoyance and to\r\nassume an amiable expression.","Shatov was at home and rather unwell. He\r\nwas lying on his bed, though dressed.\r\n\r\n\"What bad luck!\" Pyotr Stepanovitch cried out in the doorway. \"Are you\r\nreally ill?\"\r\n\r\nThe amiable expression of his face suddenly vanished; there was a gleam\r\nof spite in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all.\" Shatov jumped up nervously. \"I am not ill at all... a\r\nlittle headache...\"\r\n\r\nHe was disconcerted; the sudden appearance of such a visitor positively\r\nalarmed him.","\"You mustn't be ill for the job I've come about,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\nbegan quickly and, as it were, peremptorily. \"Allow me to sit down.\" (He\r\nsat down.) \"And you sit down again on your bedstead; that's right. There\r\nwill be a party of our fellows at Virginsky's to-night on the pretext of\r\nhis birthday; it will have no political character, however--we've seen\r\nto that. I am coming with Nikolay Stavrogin.","I would not, of course,\r\nhave dragged you there, knowing your way of thinking at present...\r\nsimply to save your being worried, not because we think you would betray\r\nus. But as things have turned out, you will have to go. You'll meet\r\nthere the very people with whom we shall finally settle how you are\r\nto leave the society and to whom you are to hand over what is in your\r\nkeeping. We'll do it without being noticed; I'll take you aside into a\r\ncorner; there'll be a lot of people and there's no need for every one to\r\nknow.","I must confess I've had to keep my tongue wagging on your behalf;\r\nbut now I believe they've agreed, on condition you hand over the\r\nprinting press and all the papers, of course. Then you can go where you\r\nplease.\"\r\n\r\nShatov listened, frowning and resentful. The nervous alarm of a moment\r\nbefore had entirely left him.\r\n\r\n\"I don't acknowledge any sort of obligation to give an account to the\r\ndevil knows whom,\" he declared definitely.","\"No one has the authority to\r\nset me free.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite so. A great deal has been entrusted to you. You hadn't the\r\nright to break off simply. Besides, you made no clear statement about\r\nit, so that you put them in an ambiguous position.\"\r\n\r\n\"I stated my position clearly by letter as soon as I arrived here.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it wasn't clear,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch retorted calmly. \"I sent you\r\n'A Noble Personality' to be printed here, and meaning the copies to be\r\nkept here till they were wanted; and the two manifestoes as well.","You\r\nreturned them with an ambiguous letter which explained nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I refused definitely to print them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, not definitely. You wrote that you couldn't, but you didn't\r\nexplain for what reason. 'I can't' doesn't mean 'I don't want to.' It\r\nmight be supposed that you were simply unable through circumstances.\r\nThat was how they took it, and considered that you still meant to keep\r\nup your connection with the society, so that they might have entrusted\r\nsomething to you again and so have compromised themselves.","They say here\r\nthat you simply meant to deceive them, so that you might betray them\r\nwhen you got hold of something important. I have defended you to the\r\nbest of my powers, and have shown your brief note as evidence in your\r\nfavour. But I had to admit on rereading those two lines that they were\r\nmisleading and not conclusive.\"\r\n\r\n\"You kept that note so carefully then?\"\r\n\r\n\"My keeping it means nothing; I've got it still.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't care, damn it!\" Shatov cried furiously. \"Your fools may\r\nconsider that I've betrayed them if they like--what is it to me? I\r\nshould like to see what you can do to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your name would be noted, and at the first success of the revolution\r\nyou would be hanged.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's when you get the upper hand and dominate Russia?\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't laugh. I tell you again, I stood up for you.","Anyway, I\r\nadvise you to turn up to-day. Why waste words through false pride?\r\nIsn't it better to part friends? In any case you'll have to give up the\r\nprinting press and the old type and papers--that's what we must talk\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll come,\" Shatov muttered, looking down thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch glanced askance at him from his place.\r\n\r\n\"Will Stavrogin be there?\" Shatov asked suddenly, raising his head.","\"He is certain to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha ha!\"\r\n\r\nAgain they were silent for a minute. Shatov grinned disdainfully and\r\nirritably.\r\n\r\n\"And that contemptible 'Noble Personality' of yours, that I wouldn't\r\nprint here. Has it been printed?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"To make the schoolboys believe that Herzen himself had written it in\r\nyour album?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Herzen himself.\"\r\n\r\nAgain they were silent for three minutes.","At last Shatov got up from the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n\"Go out of my room; I don't care to sit with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch brought out with positive alacrity,\r\ngetting up at once. \"Only one word: Kirillov is quite alone in the lodge\r\nnow, isn't he, without a servant?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite alone. Get along; I can't stand being in the same room with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you are a pleasant customer now!\" Pyotr Stepanovitch reflected\r\ngaily as he went out into the street, \"and you will be pleasant this\r\nevening too, and that just suits me; nothing better could be wished,\r\nnothing better could be wished! The Russian God Himself seems helping\r\nme.","\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nHe had probably been very busy that day on all sorts of errands and\r\nprobably with success, which was reflected in the self-satisfied\r\nexpression of his face when at six o'clock that evening he turned up at\r\nStavrogin's. But he was not at once admitted: Stavrogin had just locked\r\nhimself in the study with Mavriky Nikolaevitch. This news instantly made\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch anxious. He seated himself close to the study door\r\nto wait for the visitor to go away.","He could hear conversation but could\r\nnot catch the words. The visit did not last long; soon he heard a noise,\r\nthe sound of an extremely loud and abrupt voice, then the door opened\r\nand Mavriky Nikolaevitch came out with a very pale face. He did not\r\nnotice Pyotr Stepanovitch, and quickly passed by. Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\ninstantly ran into the study.\r\n\r\nI cannot omit a detailed account of the very brief interview that had\r\ntaken place between the two \"rivals\"--an interview which might well\r\nhave seemed impossible under the circumstances, but which had yet taken\r\nplace.","This is how it had come about. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had been enjoying\r\nan after-dinner nap on the couch in his study when Alexey Yegorytch had\r\nannounced the unexpected visitor. Hearing the name, he had positively\r\nleapt up, unwilling to believe it. But soon a smile gleamed on his\r\nlips--a smile of haughty triumph and at the same time of a blank,\r\nincredulous wonder. The visitor, Mavriky Nikolaevitch, seemed struck by\r\nthe expression of that smile as he came in; anyway, he stood still in\r\nthe middle of the room as though uncertain whether to come further in or\r\nto turn back.","Stavrogin succeeded at once in transforming the expression\r\nof his face, and with an air of grave surprise took a step towards him.\r\nThe visitor did not take his outstretched hand, but awkwardly moved a\r\nchair and, not uttering a word, sat down without waiting for his host to\r\ndo so. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch sat down on the sofa facing him obliquely\r\nand, looking at Mavriky Nikolaevitch, waited in silence.","\"If you can, marry Lizaveta Nikolaevna,\" Mavriky Nikolaevitch brought\r\nout suddenly at last, and what was most curious, it was impossible\r\nto tell from his tone whether it was an entreaty, a recommendation, a\r\nsurrender, or a command.\r\n\r\nStavrogin still remained silent, but the visitor had evidently said all\r\nhe had come to say and gazed at him persistently, waiting for an answer.\r\n\r\n\"If I am not mistaken (but it's quite certain), Lizaveta Nikolaevna is\r\nalready betrothed to you,\" Stavrogin said at last.","\"Promised and betrothed,\" Mavriky Nikolaevitch assented firmly and\r\nclearly.\r\n\r\n\"You have... quarrelled? Excuse me, Mavriky Nikolaevitch.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, she 'loves and respects me'; those are her words. Her words are\r\nmore precious than anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of that there can be no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"But let me tell you, if she were standing in the church at her wedding\r\nand you were to call her, she'd give up me and every one and go to you.","\"\r\n\r\n\"From the wedding?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and after the wedding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you making a mistake?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Under her persistent, sincere, and intense hatred for you love is\r\nflashing out at every moment... and madness... the sincerest infinite\r\nlove and... madness! On the contrary, behind the love she feels for me,\r\nwhich is sincere too, every moment there are flashes of hatred... the\r\nmost intense hatred! I could never have fancied all these transitions.","..\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I wonder, though, how could you come here and dispose of the hand\r\nof Lizaveta Nikolaevna? Have you the right to do so? Has she authorised\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nMavriky Nikolaevitch frowned and for a minute he looked down.\r\n\r\n\"That's all words on your part,\" he brought out suddenly, \"words of\r\nrevenge and triumph; I am sure you can read between the lines, and is\r\nthis the time for petty vanity? Haven't you satisfaction enough? Must I\r\nreally dot my i's and go into it all? Very well, I will dot my i's, if\r\nyou are so anxious for my humiliation.","I have no right, it's impossible\r\nfor me to be authorised; Lizaveta Nikolaevna knows nothing about it\r\nand her betrothed has finally lost his senses and is only fit for a\r\nmadhouse, and, to crown everything, has come to tell you so himself. You\r\nare the only man in the world who can make her happy, and I am the one\r\nto make her unhappy. You are trying to get her, you are pursuing her,\r\nbut--I don't know why--you won't marry her.","If it's because of a lovers'\r\nquarrel abroad and I must be sacrificed to end it, sacrifice me. She is\r\ntoo unhappy and I can't endure it. My words are not a sanction, not a\r\nprescription, and so it's no slur on your pride. If you care to take\r\nmy place at the altar, you can do it without any sanction from me, and\r\nthere is no ground for me to come to you with a mad proposal, especially\r\nas our marriage is utterly impossible after the step I am taking now.","I\r\ncannot lead her to the altar feeling myself an abject wretch. What I am\r\ndoing here and my handing her over to you, perhaps her bitterest foe, is\r\nto my mind something so abject that I shall never get over it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you shoot yourself on our wedding day?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, much later. Why stain her bridal dress with my blood? Perhaps I\r\nshall not shoot myself at all, either now or later.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you want to comfort me by saying that?\"\r\n\r\n\"You? What would the blood of one more mean to you?\" He turned pale and\r\nhis eyes gleamed.","A minute of silence followed.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me for the questions I've asked you,\" Stavrogin began again;\r\n\"some of them I had no business to ask you, but one of them I think I\r\nhave every right to put to you. Tell me, what facts have led you to\r\nform a conclusion as to my feelings for Lizaveta Nikolaevna? I mean to\r\na conviction of a degree of feeling on my part as would justify your\r\ncoming here... and risking such a proposal.","\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" Mavriky Nikolaevitch positively started. \"Haven't you been\r\ntrying to win her? Aren't you trying to win her, and don't you want to\r\nwin her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Generally speaking, I can't speak of my feeling for this woman or that\r\nto a third person or to anyone except the woman herself. You must excuse\r\nit, it's a constitutional peculiarity. But to make up for it, I'll tell\r\nyou the truth about everything else; I am married, and it's impossible\r\nfor me either to marry or to try 'to win' anyone.","\"\r\n\r\nMavriky Nikolaevitch was so astounded that he started back in his chair\r\nand for some time stared fixedly into Stavrogin's face.\r\n\r\n\"Only fancy, I never thought of that,\" he muttered. \"You said then, that\r\nmorning, that you were not married... and so I believed you were not\r\nmarried.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned terribly pale; suddenly he brought his fist down on the table\r\nwith all his might.\r\n\r\n\"If after that confession you don't leave Lizaveta Nikolaevna alone,\r\nif you make her unhappy, I'll kill you with my stick like a dog in a\r\nditch!\"\r\n\r\nHe jumped up and walked quickly out of the room.","Pyotr Stepanovitch,\r\nrunning in, found his host in a most unexpected frame of mind.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that's you!\" Stavrogin laughed loudly; his laughter seemed to be\r\nprovoked simply by the appearance of Pyotr Stepanovitch as he ran in\r\nwith such impulsive curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"Were you listening at the door? Wait a bit. What have you come about?\r\nI promised you something, didn't I? Ah, bah! I remember, to meet 'our\r\nfellows.","' Let us go. I am delighted. You couldn't have thought of\r\nanything more appropriate.\" He snatched up his hat and they both went at\r\nonce out of the house.\r\n\r\n\"Are you laughing beforehand at the prospect of seeing 'our fellows'?\"\r\nchirped gaily Pyotr Stepanovitch, dodging round him with obsequious\r\nalacrity, at one moment trying to walk beside his companion on the\r\nnarrow brick pavement and at the next running right into the mud of\r\nthe road; for Stavrogin walked in the middle of the pavement without\r\nobserving that he left no room for anyone else.","\"I am not laughing at all,\" he answered loudly and gaily; \"on the\r\ncontrary, I am sure that you have the most serious set of people there.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Surly dullards,' as you once deigned to express it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is more amusing sometimes than a surly dullard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you mean Mavriky Nikolaevitch? I am convinced he came to give up\r\nhis betrothed to you, eh? I egged him on to do it, indirectly, would you\r\nbelieve it? And if he doesn't give her up, we'll take her, anyway, won't\r\nwe--eh?\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch knew no doubt that he was running some risk in\r\nventuring on such sallies, but when he was excited he preferred to risk\r\nanything rather than to remain in uncertainty.","Stavrogin only laughed.\r\n\r\n\"You still reckon you'll help me?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"If you call me. But you know there's one way, and the best one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do I know your way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, that's a secret for the time. Only remember, a secret has its\r\nprice.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know what it costs,\" Stavrogin muttered to himself, but he restrained\r\nhimself and was silent.\r\n\r\n\"What it costs? What did you say?\" Pyotr Stepanovitch was startled.","\"I said, 'Damn you and your secret!' You'd better be telling me who will\r\nbe there. I know that we are going to a name-day party, but who will be\r\nthere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, all sorts! Even Kirillov.\"\r\n\r\n\"All members of circles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hang it all, you are in a hurry! There's not one circle formed yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you manage to distribute so many manifestoes then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where we are going only four are members of the circle.","The others on\r\nprobation are spying on one another with jealous eagerness, and bring\r\nreports to me. They are a trustworthy set. It's all material which\r\nwe must organise, and then we must clear out. But you wrote the rules\r\nyourself, there's no need to explain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are things going badly then? Is there a hitch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Going? Couldn't be better. It will amuse you: the first thing which has\r\na tremendous effect is giving them titles.","Nothing has more influence\r\nthan a title. I invent ranks and duties on purpose; I have secretaries,\r\nsecret spies, treasurers, presidents, registrars, their assistants--they\r\nlike it awfully, it's taken capitally. Then, the next force is\r\nsentimentalism, of course. You know, amongst us socialism spreads\r\nprincipally through sentimentalism. But the trouble is these lieutenants\r\nwho bite; sometimes you put your foot in it.","Then come the out-and-out\r\nrogues; well, they are a good sort, if you like, and sometimes very\r\nuseful; but they waste a lot of one's time, they want incessant looking\r\nafter. And the most important force of all--the cement that holds\r\neverything together--is their being ashamed of having an opinion\r\nof their own. That is a force! And whose work is it, whose precious\r\nachievement is it, that not one idea of their own is left in their\r\nheads! They think originality a disgrace.","\"\r\n\r\n\"If so, why do you take so much trouble?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, if people lie simply gaping at every one, how can you resist\r\nannexing them? Can you seriously refuse to believe in the possibility\r\nof success? Yes, you have the faith, but one wants will. It's just with\r\npeople like this that success is possible. I tell you I could make them\r\ngo through fire; one has only to din it into them that they are not\r\nadvanced enough.","The fools reproach me that I have taken in every one\r\nhere over the central committee and 'the innumerable branches.' You once\r\nblamed me for it yourself, but where's the deception? You and I are the\r\ncentral committee and there will be as many branches as we like.\"\r\n\r\n\"And always the same sort of rabble!\"\r\n\r\n\"Raw material. Even they will be of use.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are still reckoning on me?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are the chief, you are the head; I shall only be a subordinate,\r\nyour secretary.","We shall take to our barque, you know; the oars are of\r\nmaple, the sails are of silk, at the helm sits a fair maiden, Lizaveta\r\nNikolaevna... hang it, how does it go in the ballad?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is stuck,\" laughed Stavrogin. \"No, I'd better give you my version.\r\nThere you reckon on your fingers the forces that make up the circles.\r\nAll that business of titles and sentimentalism is a very good cement,\r\nbut there is something better; persuade four members of the circle to\r\ndo for a fifth on the pretence that he is a traitor, and you'll tie\r\nthem all together with the blood they've shed as though it were a knot.","They'll be your slaves, they won't dare to rebel or call you to account.\r\nHa ha ha!\"\r\n\r\n\"But you... you shall pay for those words,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch thought\r\nto himself, \"and this very evening, in fact. You go too far.\"\r\n\r\nThis or something like this must have been Pyotr Stepanovitch's\r\nreflection. They were approaching Virginsky's house.\r\n\r\n\"You've represented me, no doubt, as a member from abroad, an inspector\r\nin connection with the _Internationale?_\" Stavrogin asked suddenly.","\"No, not an inspector; you won't be an inspector; but you are one of\r\nthe original members from abroad, who knows the most important\r\nsecrets--that's your r√¥le. You are going to speak, of course?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's put that idea into your head?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now you are bound to speak.\"\r\n\r\nStavrogin positively stood still in the middle of the street in\r\nsurprise, not far from a street lamp. Pyotr Stepanovitch faced his\r\nscrutiny calmly and defiantly.","Stavrogin cursed and went on.\r\n\r\n\"And are you going to speak?\" he suddenly asked Pyotr Stepanovitch.\r\n\r\n\"No, I am going to listen to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn you, you really are giving me an idea!\"\r\n\r\n\"What idea?\" Pyotr Stepanovitch asked quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I will speak there, but afterwards I will give you a\r\nhiding--and a sound one too, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way, I told Karmazinov this morning that you said he ought to be\r\nthrashed, and not simply as a form but to hurt, as they flog peasants.","\"\r\n\r\n\"But I never said such a thing; ha ha!\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter. _Se non √® vero..._\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, thanks. I am truly obliged.\"\r\n\r\n\"And another thing. Do you know, Karmazinov says that the essence of\r\nour creed is the negation of honour, and that by the open advocacy of a\r\nright to be dishonourable a Russian can be won over more easily than by\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\n\"An excellent saying! Golden words!\" cried Stavrogin.","\"He's hit the mark\r\nthere! The right to dishonour--why, they'd all flock to us for that, not\r\none would stay behind! And listen, Verhovensky, you are not one of the\r\nhigher police, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyone who has a question like that in his mind doesn't utter it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand, but we are by ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, so far I am not one of the higher police. Enough, here we are.\r\nCompose your features, Stavrogin; I always do mine when I go in.","A\r\ngloomy expression, that's all, nothing more is wanted; it's a very\r\nsimple business.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. A MEETING\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nVIRGINSKY LIVED IN HIS OWN house, or rather his wife's, in Muravyin\r\nStreet. It was a wooden house of one story, and there were no lodgers in\r\nit. On the pretext of Virginsky's-name-day party, about fifteen guests\r\nwere assembled; but the entertainment was not in the least like an\r\nordinary provincial name-day party.","From the very beginning of their\r\nmarried life the husband and wife had agreed once for all that it was\r\nutterly stupid to invite friends to celebrate name-days, and that \"there\r\nis nothing to rejoice about in fact.\" In a few years they had succeeded\r\nin completely cutting themselves off from all society. Though he was\r\na man of some ability, and by no means very poor, he somehow seemed\r\nto every one an eccentric fellow who was fond of solitude, and, what's\r\nmore, \"stuck up in conversation.","\" Madame Virginsky was a midwife by\r\nprofession--and by that very fact was on the lowest rung of the social\r\nladder, lower even than the priest's wife in spite of her husband's\r\nrank as an officer. But she was conspicuously lacking in the humility\r\nbefitting her position. And after her very stupid and unpardonably open\r\nliaison on principle with Captain Lebyadkin, a notorious rogue, even the\r\nmost indulgent of our ladies turned away from her with marked contempt.","But Madame Virginsky accepted all this as though it were what she\r\nwanted. It is remarkable that those very ladies applied to Arina\r\nProhorovna (that is, Madame Virginsky) when they were in an interesting\r\ncondition, rather than to any one of the other three _accoucheuses_ of\r\nthe town. She was sent for even by country families living in the\r\nneighbourhood, so great was the belief in her knowledge, luck, and skill\r\nin critical cases.","It ended in her practising only among the wealthiest\r\nladies; she was greedy of money. Feeling her power to the full, she\r\nended by not putting herself out for anyone. Possibly on purpose,\r\nindeed, in her practice in the best houses she used to scare nervous\r\npatients by the most incredible and nihilistic disregard of good\r\nmanners, or by jeering at \"everything holy,\" at the very time when\r\n\"everything holy\" might have come in most useful.","Our town doctor,\r\nRozanov--he too was an _accoucheur_--asserted most positively that on one\r\noccasion when a patient in labour was crying out and calling on the name\r\nof the Almighty, a free-thinking sally from Arina Prohorovna, fired off\r\nlike a pistol-shot, had so terrifying an effect on the patient that it\r\ngreatly accelerated her delivery.\r\n\r\nBut though she was a nihilist, Madame Virginsky did not, when occasion\r\narose, disdain social or even old-fashioned superstitions and customs\r\nif they could be of any advantage to herself.","She would never, for\r\ninstance, have stayed away from a baby's christening, and always put on\r\na green silk dress with a train and adorned her chignon with curls and\r\nringlets for such events, though at other times she positively revelled\r\nin slovenliness. And though during the ceremony she always maintained\r\n\"the most insolent air,\" so that she put the clergy to confusion, yet\r\nwhen it was over she invariably handed champagne to the guests (it was\r\nfor that that she came and dressed up), and it was no use trying to take\r\nthe glass without a contribution to her \"porridge bowl.","\"\r\n\r\nThe guests who assembled that evening at Virginsky's (mostly men) had a\r\ncasual and exceptional air. There was no supper nor cards. In the middle\r\nof the large drawing-room, which was papered with extremely old blue\r\npaper, two tables had been put together and covered with a large though\r\nnot quite clean table-cloth, and on them two samovars were boiling. The\r\nend of the table was taken up by a huge tray with twenty-five glasses on\r\nit and a basket with ordinary French bread cut into a number of slices,\r\nas one sees it in genteel boarding-schools for boys or girls.","The tea\r\nwas poured out by a maiden lady of thirty, Arina Prohorovna's sister,\r\na silent and malevolent creature, with flaxen hair and no eyebrows, who\r\nshared her sister's progressive ideas and was an object of terror to\r\nVirginsky himself in domestic life. There were only three ladies in the\r\nroom: the lady of the house, her eyebrowless sister, and Virginsky's\r\nsister, a girl who had just arrived from Petersburg.","Arina Prohorovna, a\r\ngood-looking and buxom woman of seven-and-twenty, rather dishevelled, in\r\nan everyday greenish woollen dress, was sitting scanning the guests with\r\nher bold eyes, and her look seemed in haste to say, \"You see I am not\r\nin the least afraid of anything.\" Miss Virginsky, a rosy-cheeked student\r\nand a nihilist, who was also good-looking, short, plump and round as a\r\nlittle ball, had settled herself beside Arina Prohorovna, almost in\r\nher travelling clothes.","She held a roll of paper in her hand, and\r\nscrutinised the guests with impatient and roving eyes. Virginsky himself\r\nwas rather unwell that evening, but he came in and sat in an easy chair\r\nby the tea-table. All the guests were sitting down too, and the orderly\r\nway in which they were ranged on chairs suggested a meeting. Evidently\r\nall were expecting something and were filling up the interval with loud\r\nbut irrelevant conversation.","When Stavrogin and Verhovensky appeared\r\nthere was a sudden hush.\r\n\r\nBut I must be allowed to give a few explanations to make things clear.\r\n\r\nI believe that all these people had come together in the agreeable\r\nexpectation of hearing something particularly interesting, and had\r\nnotice of it beforehand. They were the flower of the reddest Radicalism\r\nof our ancient town, and had been carefully picked out by Virginsky for\r\nthis \"meeting.","\" I may remark, too, that some of them (though not very\r\nmany) had never visited him before. Of course most of the guests had no\r\nclear idea why they had been summoned. It was true that at that time\r\nall took Pyotr Stepanovitch for a fully authorised emissary from abroad;\r\nthis idea had somehow taken root among them at once and naturally\r\nflattered them. And yet among the citizens assembled ostensibly to\r\nkeep a name-day, there were some who had been approached with definite\r\nproposals.","Pyotr Verhovensky had succeeded in getting together a\r\n\"quintet\" amongst us like the one he had already formed in Moscow and,\r\nas appeared later, in our province among the officers. It was said that\r\nhe had another in X province. This quintet of the elect were sitting now\r\nat the general table, and very skilfully succeeded in giving themselves\r\nthe air of being quite ordinary people, so that no one could have known\r\nthem.","They were--since it is no longer a secret--first Liputin, then\r\nVirginsky himself, then Shigalov (a gentleman with long ears, the\r\nbrother of Madame Virginsky), Lyamshin, and lastly a strange person\r\ncalled Tolkatchenko, a man of forty, who was famed for his vast\r\nknowledge of the people, especially of thieves and robbers. He used\r\nto frequent the taverns on purpose (though not only with the object of\r\nstudying the people), and plumed himself on his shabby clothes, tarred\r\nboots, and crafty wink and a flourish of peasant phrases.","Lyamshin had\r\nonce or twice brought him to Stepan Trofimovitch's gatherings, where,\r\nhowever, he did not make a great sensation. He used to make his\r\nappearance in the town from time to time, chiefly when he was out of a\r\njob; he was employed on the railway.\r\n\r\nEvery one of these fine champions had formed this first group in the\r\nfervent conviction that their quintet was only one of hundreds and\r\nthousands of similar groups scattered all over Russia, and that they all\r\ndepended on some immense central but secret power, which in its turn was\r\nintimately connected with the revolutionary movement all over Europe.","But I regret to say that even at that time there was beginning to\r\nbe dissension among them. Though they had ever since the spring been\r\nexpecting Pyotr Verhovensky, whose coming had been heralded first\r\nby Tolkatchenko and then by the arrival of Shigalov, though they had\r\nexpected extraordinary miracles from him, and though they had responded\r\nto his first summons without the slightest criticism, yet they had no\r\nsooner formed the quintet than they all somehow seemed to feel insulted;\r\nand I really believe it was owing to the promptitude with which they\r\nconsented to join.","They had joined, of course, from a not ignoble\r\nfeeling of shame, for fear people might say afterwards that they had\r\nnot dared to join; still they felt Pyotr Verhovensky ought to have\r\nappreciated their heroism and have rewarded it by telling them some\r\nreally important bits of news at least. But Verhovensky was not at all\r\ninclined to satisfy their legitimate curiosity, and told them nothing\r\nbut what was necessary; he treated them in general with great sternness\r\nand even rather casually.","This was positively irritating, and Comrade\r\nShigalov was already egging the others on to insist on his \"explaining\r\nhimself,\" though, of course, not at Virginsky's, where so many outsiders\r\nwere present.\r\n\r\nI have an idea that the above-mentioned members of the first quintet\r\nwere disposed to suspect that among the guests of Virginsky's that\r\nevening some were members of other groups, unknown to them, belonging\r\nto the same secret organisation and founded in the town by the same\r\nVerhovensky; so that in fact all present were suspecting one another,\r\nand posed in various ways to one another, which gave the whole party a\r\nvery perplexing and even romantic air.","Yet there were persons present\r\nwho were beyond all suspicion. For instance, a major in the service, a\r\nnear relation of Virginsky, a perfectly innocent person who had not been\r\ninvited but had come of himself for the name-day celebration, so that it\r\nwas impossible not to receive him. But Virginsky was quite unperturbed,\r\nas the major was \"incapable of betraying them\"; for in spite of his\r\nstupidity he had all his life been fond of dropping in wherever extreme\r\nRadicals met; he did not sympathise with their ideas himself, but\r\nwas very fond of listening to them.","What's more, he had even been\r\ncompromised indeed. It had happened in his youth that whole bundles of\r\nmanifestoes and of numbers of _The Bell_ had passed through his hands,\r\nand although he had been afraid even to open them, yet he would have\r\nconsidered it absolutely contemptible to refuse to distribute them--and\r\nthere are such people in Russia even to this day.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the guests were either types of honourable amour-propre\r\ncrushed and embittered, or types of the generous impulsiveness of ardent\r\nyouth.","There were two or three teachers, of whom one, a lame man of\r\nforty-five, a master in the high school, was a very malicious and\r\nstrikingly vain person; and two or three officers. Of the latter, one\r\nvery young artillery officer who had only just come from a military\r\ntraining school, a silent lad who had not yet made friends with anyone,\r\nturned up now at Virginsky's with a pencil in his hand, and, scarcely\r\ntaking any part in the conversation, continually made notes in his\r\nnotebook.","Everybody saw this, but every one pretended not to. There was,\r\ntoo, an idle divinity student who had helped Lyamshin to put indecent\r\nphotographs into the gospel-woman's pack. He was a solid youth with a\r\nfree-and-easy though mistrustful manner, with an unchangeably satirical\r\nsmile, together with a calm air of triumphant faith in his own\r\nperfection. There was also present, I don't know why, the mayor's son,\r\nthat unpleasant and prematurely exhausted youth to whom I have referred\r\nalready in telling the story of the lieutenant's little wife.","He was\r\nsilent the whole evening. Finally there was a very enthusiastic and\r\ntousle-headed schoolboy of eighteen, who sat with the gloomy air of a\r\nyoung man whose dignity has been wounded, evidently distressed by his\r\neighteen years. This infant was already the head of an independent\r\ngroup of conspirators which had been formed in the highest class of the\r\ngymnasium, as it came out afterwards to the surprise of every one.","I haven't mentioned Shatov. He was there at the farthest corner of the\r\ntable, his chair pushed back a little out of the row. He gazed at the\r\nground, was gloomily silent, refused tea and bread, and did not for one\r\ninstant let his cap go out of his hand, as though to show that he was\r\nnot a visitor, but had come on business, and when he liked would get up\r\nand go away. Kirillov was not far from him.","He, too, was very silent,\r\nbut he did not look at the ground; on the contrary, he scrutinised\r\nintently every speaker with his fixed, lustreless eyes, and listened\r\nto everything without the slightest emotion or surprise. Some of the\r\nvisitors who had never seen him before stole thoughtful glances at him.\r\nI can't say whether Madame Virginsky knew anything about the existence\r\nof the quintet. I imagine she knew everything and from her husband.","The girl-student, of course, took no part in anything; but she had an\r\nanxiety of her own: she intended to stay only a day or two and then to\r\ngo on farther and farther from one university town to another \"to show\r\nactive sympathy with the sufferings of poor students and to rouse\r\nthem to protest.\" She was taking with her some hundreds of copies of a\r\nlithographed appeal, I believe of her own composition.","It is remarkable\r\nthat the schoolboy conceived an almost murderous hatred for her from the\r\nfirst moment, though he saw her for the first time in his life; and she\r\nfelt the same for him. The major was her uncle, and met her to-day for\r\nthe first time after ten years. When Stavrogin and Verhovensky came in,\r\nher cheeks were as red as cranberries: she had just quarrelled with her\r\nuncle over his views on the woman question.","II\r\n\r\nWith conspicuous nonchalance Verhovensky lounged in the chair at the\r\nupper end of the table, almost without greeting anyone. His expression\r\nwas disdainful and even haughty. Stavrogin bowed politely, but in spite\r\nof the fact that they were all only waiting for them, everybody, as\r\nthough acting on instruction, appeared scarcely to notice them. The lady\r\nof the house turned severely to Stavrogin as soon as he was seated.","\"Stavrogin, will you have tea?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Tea for Stavrogin,\" she commanded her sister at the samovar. \"And you,\r\nwill you?\" (This was to Verhovensky.)\r\n\r\n\"Of course. What a question to ask a visitor! And give me cream too;\r\nyou always give one such filthy stuff by way of tea, and with a name-day\r\nparty in the house!\"\r\n\r\n\"What, you believe in keeping name-days too!\" the girl-student laughed\r\nsuddenly.","\"We were just talking of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's stale,\" muttered the schoolboy at the other end of the table.\r\n\r\n\"What's stale? To disregard conventions, even the most innocent is not\r\nstale; on the contrary, to the disgrace of every one, so far it's a\r\nnovelty,\" the girl-student answered instantly, darting forward on her\r\nchair. \"Besides, there are no innocent conventions,\" she added with\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\n\"I only meant,\" cried the schoolboy with tremendous excitement, \"to say\r\nthat though conventions of course are stale and must be eradicated, yet\r\nabout name-days everybody knows that they are stupid and very stale to\r\nwaste precious time upon, which has been wasted already all over the\r\nworld, so that it would be as well to sharpen one's wits on something\r\nmore useful.","...\"\r\n\r\n\"You drag it out so, one can't understand what you mean,\" shouted the\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n\"I think that every one has a right to express an opinion as well as\r\nevery one else, and if I want to express my opinion like anybody\r\nelse...\"\r\n\r\n\"No one is attacking your right to give an opinion,\" the lady of the\r\nhouse herself cut in sharply. \"You were only asked not to ramble because\r\nno one can make out what you mean.","\"\r\n\r\n\"But allow me to remark that you are not treating me with respect. If\r\nI couldn't fully express my thought, it's not from want of thought\r\nbut from too much thought,\" the schoolboy muttered, almost in despair,\r\nlosing his thread completely.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't know how to talk, you'd better keep quiet,\" blurted out\r\nthe girl.\r\n\r\nThe schoolboy positively jumped from his chair.\r\n\r\n\"I only wanted to state,\" he shouted, crimson with shame and afraid\r\nto look about him, \"that you only wanted to show off your cleverness\r\nbecause Mr.","Stavrogin came in--so there!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a nasty and immoral idea and shows the worthlessness of your\r\ndevelopment. I beg you not to address me again,\" the girl rattled off.\r\n\r\n\"Stavrogin,\" began the lady of the house, \"they've been discussing the\r\nrights of the family before you came--this officer here\"--she nodded\r\ntowards her relation, the major--\"and, of course, I am not going to\r\nworry you with such stale nonsense, which has been dealt with long\r\nago.","But how have the rights and duties of the family come about in the\r\nsuperstitious form in which they exist at present? That's the question.\r\nWhat's your opinion?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by 'come about'?\" Stavrogin asked in his turn.\r\n\r\n\"We know, for instance, that the superstition about God came from\r\nthunder and lightning.\" The girl-student rushed into the fray again,\r\nstaring at Stavrogin with her eyes almost jumping out of her head.","\"It's\r\nwell known that primitive man, scared by thunder and lightning, made a\r\ngod of the unseen enemy, feeling their weakness before it. But how did\r\nthe superstition of the family arise? How did the family itself arise?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not quite the same thing....\" Madame Virginsky tried to check\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"I think the answer to this question wouldn't be quite discreet,\"\r\nanswered Stavrogin.\r\n\r\n\"How so?\" said the girl-student, craning forward suddenly.","But there was\r\nan audible titter in the group of teachers, which was at once caught up\r\nat the other end by Lyamshin and the schoolboy and followed by a hoarse\r\nchuckle from the major.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to write vaudevilles,\" Madame Virginsky observed to\r\nStavrogin.\r\n\r\n\"It does you no credit, I don't know what your name is,\" the girl rapped\r\nout with positive indignation.\r\n\r\n\"And don't you be too forward,\" boomed the major.","\"You are a young lady\r\nand you ought to behave modestly, and you keep jumping about as though\r\nyou were sitting on a needle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kindly hold your tongue and don't address me familiarly with your\r\nnasty comparisons. I've never seen you before and I don't recognise the\r\nrelationship.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am your uncle; I used to carry you about when you were a baby!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care what babies you used to carry about.","I didn't ask you\r\nto carry me. It must have been a pleasure to you to do so, you\r\nrude officer. And allow me to observe, don't dare to address me so\r\nfamiliarly, unless it's as a fellow-citizen. I forbid you to do it, once\r\nfor all.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, they are all like that!\" cried the major, banging the table with\r\nhis fist and addressing Stavrogin, who was sitting opposite. \"But, allow\r\nme, I am fond of Liberalism and modern ideas, and I am fond of listening\r\nto clever conversation; masculine conversation, though, I warn you.","But\r\nto listen to these women, these nightly windmills--no, that makes me\r\nache all over! Don't wriggle about!\" he shouted to the girl, who\r\nwas leaping up from her chair. \"No, it's my turn to speak, I've been\r\ninsulted.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't say anything yourself, and only hinder other people talking,\"\r\nthe lady of the house grumbled indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"No, I will have my say,\" said the major hotly, addressing Stavrogin.","\"I\r\nreckon on you, Mr. Stavrogin, as a fresh person who has only just come\r\non the scene, though I haven't the honour of knowing you. Without men\r\nthey'll perish like flies--that's what I think. All their woman question\r\nis only lack of originality. I assure you that all this woman question\r\nhas been invented for them by men in foolishness and to their own hurt.\r\nI only thank God I am not married.","There's not the slightest variety in\r\nthem, they can't even invent a simple pattern; they have to get men to\r\ninvent them for them! Here I used to carry her in my arms, used to dance\r\nthe mazurka with her when she was ten years old; to-day she's come,\r\nnaturally I fly to embrace her, and at the second word she tells me\r\nthere's no God. She might have waited a little, she was in too great a\r\nhurry! Clever people don't believe, I dare say; but that's from their\r\ncleverness.","But you, chicken, what do you know about God, I said to\r\nher. 'Some student taught you, and if he'd taught you to light the lamp\r\nbefore the ikons you would have lighted it.'\"\r\n\r\n\"You keep telling lies, you are a very spiteful person. I proved to\r\nyou just now the untenability of your position,\" the girl answered\r\ncontemptuously, as though disdaining further explanations with such a\r\nman. \"I told you just now that we've all been taught in the Catechism\r\nif you honour your father and your parents you will live long and have\r\nwealth.","That's in the Ten Commandments. If God thought it necessary to\r\noffer rewards for love, your God must be immoral. That's how I proved it\r\nto you. It wasn't the second word, and it was because you asserted your\r\nrights. It's not my fault if you are stupid and don't understand even\r\nnow. You are offended and you are spiteful--and that's what explains all\r\nyour generation.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a goose!\" said the major.","\"And you are a fool!\"\r\n\r\n\"You can call me names!\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, Kapiton Maximitch, you told me yourself you don't believe in\r\nGod,\" Liputin piped from the other end of the table.\r\n\r\n\"What if I did say so--that's a different matter. I believe, perhaps,\r\nonly not altogether. Even if I don't believe altogether, still I don't\r\nsay God ought to be shot. I used to think about God before I left the\r\nhussars.","From all the poems you would think that hussars do nothing but\r\ncarouse and drink. Yes, I did drink, maybe, but would you believe it,\r\nI used to jump out of bed at night and stood crossing myself before the\r\nimages with nothing but my socks on, praying to God to give me faith;\r\nfor even then I couldn't be at peace as to whether there was a God or\r\nnot. It used to fret me so! In the morning, of course, one would amuse\r\noneself and one's faith would seem to be lost again; and in fact I've\r\nnoticed that faith always seems to be less in the daytime.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you any cards?\" asked Verhovensky, with a mighty yawn,\r\naddressing Madame Virginsky.\r\n\r\n\"I sympathise with your question, I sympathise entirely,\" the\r\ngirl-student broke in hotly, flushed with indignation at the major's\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\"We are wasting precious time listening to silly talk,\" snapped out the\r\nlady of the house, and she looked reprovingly at her husband.\r\n\r\nThe girl pulled herself together.","\"I wanted to make a statement to the meeting concerning the sufferings\r\nof the students and their protest, but as time is being wasted in\r\nimmoral conversation...\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no such thing as moral or immoral,\" the schoolboy brought out,\r\nunable to restrain himself as soon as the girl began.\r\n\r\n\"I knew that, Mr. Schoolboy, long before you were taught it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I maintain,\" he answered savagely, \"that you are a child come\r\nfrom Petersburg to enlighten us all, though we know for ourselves the\r\ncommandment 'honour thy father and thy mother,' which you could not\r\nrepeat correctly; and the fact that it's immoral every one in Russia\r\nknows from Byelinsky.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we ever to have an end of this?\" Madame Virginsky said resolutely\r\nto her husband. As the hostess, she blushed for the ineptitude of the\r\nconversation, especially as she noticed smiles and even astonishment\r\namong the guests who had been invited for the first time.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Virginsky, suddenly lifting up his voice, \"if anyone\r\nwishes to say anything more nearly connected with our business, or has\r\nany statement to make, I call upon him to do so without wasting time.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll venture to ask one question,\" said the lame teacher suavely. He\r\nhad been sitting particularly decorously and had not spoken till then.\r\n\"I should like to know, are we some sort of meeting, or are we simply a\r\ngathering of ordinary mortals paying a visit? I ask simply for the sake\r\nof order and so as not to remain in ignorance.\"\r\n\r\nThis \"sly\" question made an impression. People looked at each other,\r\nevery one expecting someone else to answer, and suddenly all, as though\r\nat a word of command, turned their eyes to Verhovensky and Stavrogin.","\"I suggest our voting on the answer to the question whether we are a\r\nmeeting or not,\" said Madame Virginsky.\r\n\r\n\"I entirely agree with the suggestion,\" Liputin chimed in, \"though the\r\nquestion is rather vague.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree too.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so do I,\" cried voices. \"I too think it would make our proceedings\r\nmore in order,\" confirmed Virginsky.\r\n\r\n\"To the vote then,\" said his wife. \"Lyamshin, please sit down to the\r\npiano; you can give your vote from there when the voting begins.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Again!\" cried Lyamshin. \"I've strummed enough for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg you most particularly, sit down and play. Don't you care to do\r\nanything for the cause?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I assure you, Arina Prohorovna, nobody is eavesdropping. It's\r\nonly your fancy. Besides, the windows are high, and people would not\r\nunderstand if they did hear.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't understand ourselves,\" someone muttered. \"But I tell you one\r\nmust always be on one's guard.","I mean in case there should be spies,\"\r\nshe explained to Verhovensky. \"Let them hear from the street that we\r\nhave music and a name-day party.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hang it all!\" Lyamshin swore, and sitting down to the piano, began\r\nstrumming a valse, banging on the keys almost with his fists, at random.\r\n\r\n\"I propose that those who want it to be a meeting should put up their\r\nright hands,\" Madame Virginsky proposed.","Some put them up, others did not. Some held them up and then put them\r\ndown again and then held them up again. \"Foo! I don't understand it at\r\nall,\" one officer shouted. \"I don't either,\" cried the other.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I understand,\" cried a third. \"If it's yes, you hold your hand up.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what does 'yes' mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Means a meeting.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it means not a meeting.\"\r\n\r\n\"I voted for a meeting,\" cried the schoolboy to Madame Virginsky.","\"Then why didn't you hold up your hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was looking at you. You didn't hold up yours, so I didn't hold up\r\nmine.\"\r\n\r\n\"How stupid! I didn't hold up my hand because I proposed it. Gentlemen,\r\nnow I propose the contrary. Those who want a meeting, sit still and do\r\nnothing; those who don't, hold up their right hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those who don't want it?\" inquired the schoolboy. \"Are you doing it on\r\npurpose?\" cried Madame Virginsky wrathfully.","\"No. Excuse me, those who want it, or those who don't want it? For one\r\nmust know that definitely,\" cried two or three voices.\r\n\r\n\"Those who don't want it--those who _don't_ want it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but what is one to do, hold up one's hand or not hold it up if one\r\ndoesn't want it?\" cried an officer.\r\n\r\n\"Ech, we are not accustomed to constitutional methods yet!\" remarked the\r\nmajor.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lyamshin, excuse me, but you are thumping so that no one can hear\r\nanything,\" observed the lame teacher.","\"But, upon my word, Arina Prohorovna, nobody is listening, really!\"\r\ncried Lyamshin, jumping up. \"I won't play! I've come to you as a\r\nvisitor, not as a drummer!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" Virginsky went on, \"answer verbally, are we a meeting or\r\nnot?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are! We are!\" was heard on all sides. \"If so, there's no need to\r\nvote, that's enough. Are you satisfied, gentlemen? Is there any need to\r\nput it to the vote?\"\r\n\r\n\"No need--no need, we understand.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps someone doesn't want it to be a meeting?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; we all want it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what does 'meeting' mean?\" cried a voice. No one answered.\r\n\r\n\"We must choose a chairman,\" people cried from different parts of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\"Our host, of course, our host!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, if so,\" Virginsky, the chosen chairman, began, \"I propose\r\nmy original motion. If anyone wants to say anything more relevant to the\r\nsubject, or has some statement to make, let him bring it forward without\r\nloss of time.","\"\r\n\r\nThere was a general silence. The eyes of all were turned again on\r\nVerhovensky and Stavrogin.\r\n\r\n\"Verhovensky, have you no statement to make?\" Madame Virginsky asked him\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing whatever,\" he answered, yawning and stretching on his chair.\r\n\"But I should like a glass of brandy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stavrogin, don't you want to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, I don't drink.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean don't you want to speak, not don't you want brandy.","\"\r\n\r\n\"To speak, what about? No, I don't want to.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll bring you some brandy,\" she answered Verhovensky.\r\n\r\nThe girl-student got up. She had darted up several times already.\r\n\r\n\"I have come to make a statement about the sufferings of poor students\r\nand the means of rousing them to protest.\"\r\n\r\nBut she broke off. At the other end of the table a rival had risen, and\r\nall eyes turned to him. Shigalov, the man with the long ears, slowly\r\nrose from his seat with a gloomy and sullen air and mournfully laid on\r\nthe table a thick notebook filled with extremely small handwriting.","He remained standing in silence. Many people looked at the notebook\r\nin consternation, but Liputin, Virginsky, and the lame teacher seemed\r\npleased.\r\n\r\n\"I ask leave to address the meeting,\" Shigalov pronounced sullenly but\r\nresolutely.\r\n\r\n\"You have leave.\" Virginsky gave his sanction.\r\n\r\nThe orator sat down, was silent for half a minute, and pronounced in a\r\nsolemn voice,\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here's the brandy,\" the sister who had been pouring out tea and had\r\ngone to fetch brandy rapped out, contemptuously and disdainfully putting\r\nthe bottle before Verhovensky, together with the wineglass which she\r\nbrought in her fingers without a tray or a plate.","The interrupted orator made a dignified pause.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, go on, I am not listening,\" cried Verhovensky, pouring\r\nhimself out a glass.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, asking your attention and, as you will see later, soliciting\r\nyour aid in a matter of the first importance,\" Shigalov began again, \"I\r\nmust make some prefatory remarks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arina Prohorovna, haven't you some scissors?\" Pyotr Stepanovitch asked\r\nsuddenly.","\"What do you want scissors for?\" she asked, with wide-open eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I've forgotten to cut my nails; I've been meaning to for the last three\r\ndays,\" he observed, scrutinising his long and dirty nails with unruffled\r\ncomposure.\r\n\r\nArina Prohorovna crimsoned, but Miss Virginsky seemed pleased.\r\n\r\n\"I believe I saw them just now on the window.\" She got up from the\r\ntable, went and found the scissors, and at once brought them.","Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch did not even look at her, took the scissors, and set to\r\nwork with them. Arina Prohorovna grasped that these were realistic\r\nmanners, and was ashamed of her sensitiveness. People looked at one\r\nanother in silence. The lame teacher looked vindictively and enviously\r\nat Verhovensky. Shigalov went on.\r\n\r\n\"Dedicating my energies to the study of the social organisation which is\r\nin the future to replace the present condition of things, I've come to\r\nthe conviction that all makers of social systems from ancient times up\r\nto the present year, 187-, have been dreamers, tellers of fairy-tales,\r\nfools who contradicted themselves, who understood nothing of natural\r\nscience and the strange animal called man.","Plato, Rousseau, Fourier,\r\ncolumns of aluminium, are only fit for sparrows and not for human\r\nsociety. But, now that we are all at last preparing to act, a new\r\nform of social organisation is essential. In order to avoid further\r\nuncertainty, I propose my own system of world-organisation. Here it is.\"\r\nHe tapped the notebook. \"I wanted to expound my views to the meeting in\r\nthe most concise form possible, but I see that I should need to add a\r\ngreat many verbal explanations, and so the whole exposition would occupy\r\nat least ten evenings, one for each of my chapters.","\" (There was the\r\nsound of laughter.) \"I must add, besides, that my system is not yet\r\ncomplete.\" (Laughter again.) \"I am perplexed by my own data and my\r\nconclusion is a direct contradiction of the original idea with which I\r\nstart. Starting from unlimited freedom, I arrive at unlimited despotism.\r\nI will add, however, that there can be no solution of the social problem\r\nbut mine.\"\r\n\r\nThe laughter grew louder and louder, but it came chiefly from the\r\nyounger and less initiated visitors.","There was an expression of some\r\nannoyance on the faces of Madame Virginsky, Liputin, and the lame\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\n\"If you've been unsuccessful in making your system consistent, and have\r\nbeen reduced to despair yourself, what could we do with it?\" one officer\r\nobserved warily.\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Mr. Officer\"--Shigalov turned sharply to\r\nhim--\"especially in using the word despair. Yes, I am reduced to despair.","Nevertheless, nothing can take the place of the system set forth in my\r\nbook, and there is no other way out of it; no one can invent anything\r\nelse. And so I hasten without loss of time to invite the whole society\r\nto listen for ten evenings to my book and then give their opinions of\r\nit. If the members are unwilling to listen to me, let us break up from\r\nthe start--the men to take up service under government, the women to\r\ntheir cooking; for if you reject my solution you'll find no other, none\r\nwhatever! If they let the opportunity slip, it will simply be their\r\nloss, for they will be bound to come back to it again.","\"\r\n\r\nThere was a stir in the company. \"Is he mad, or what?\" voices asked.\r\n\r\n\"So the whole point lies in Shigalov's despair,\" Lyamshin commented,\r\n\"and the essential question is whether he must despair or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shigalov's being on the brink of despair is a personal question,\"\r\ndeclared the schoolboy.\r\n\r\n\"I propose we put it to the vote how far Shigalov's despair affects the\r\ncommon cause, and at the same time whether it's worth while listening to\r\nhim or not,\" an officer suggested gaily.","\"That's not right.\" The lame teacher put in his spoke at last. As a rule\r\nhe spoke with a rather mocking smile, so that it was difficult to make\r\nout whether he was in earnest or joking. \"That's not right, gentlemen.\r\nMr. Shigalov is too much devoted to his task and is also too modest.\r\nI know his book. He suggests as a final solution of the question the\r\ndivision of mankind into two unequal parts.","One-tenth enjoys absolute\r\nliberty and unbounded power over the other nine-tenths. The others\r\nhave to give up all individuality and become, so to speak, a herd, and,\r\nthrough boundless submission, will by a series of regenerations attain\r\nprim√¶val innocence, something like the Garden of Eden. They'll have\r\nto work, however. The measures proposed by the author for depriving\r\nnine-tenths of mankind of their freedom and transforming them into a\r\nherd through the education of whole generations are very remarkable,\r\nfounded on the facts of nature and highly logical.","One may not agree\r\nwith some of the deductions, but it would be difficult to doubt the\r\nintelligence and knowledge of the author. It's a pity that the time\r\nrequired--ten evenings--is impossible to arrange for, or we might hear a\r\ngreat deal that's interesting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you be in earnest?\" Madame Virginsky addressed the lame gentleman\r\nwith a shade of positive uneasiness in her voice, \"when that man doesn't\r\nknow what to do with people and so turns nine-tenths of them into\r\nslaves? I've suspected him for a long time.","\"\r\n\r\n\"You say that of your own brother?\" asked the lame man.\r\n\r\n\"Relationship? Are you laughing at me?\"\r\n\r\n\"And besides, to work for aristocrats and to obey them as though they\r\nwere gods is contemptible!\" observed the girl-student fiercely.\r\n\r\n\"What I propose is not contemptible; it's paradise, an earthly\r\nparadise, and there can be no other on earth,\" Shigalov pronounced\r\nauthoritatively.\r\n\r\n\"For my part,\" said Lyamshin, \"if I didn't know what to do with\r\nnine-tenths of mankind, I'd take them and blow them up into the air\r\ninstead of putting them in paradise.","I'd only leave a handful of\r\neducated people, who would live happily ever afterwards on scientific\r\nprinciples.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one but a buffoon can talk like that!\" cried the girl, flaring up.\r\n\r\n\"He is a buffoon, but he is of use,\" Madame Virginsky whispered to her.\r\n\r\n\"And possibly that would be the best solution of the problem,\" said\r\nShigalov, turning hotly to Lyamshin. \"You certainly don't know what a\r\nprofound thing you've succeeded in saying, my merry friend.","But as it's\r\nhardly possible to carry out your idea, we must confine ourselves to an\r\nearthly paradise, since that's what they call it.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is pretty thorough rot,\" broke, as though involuntarily, from\r\nVerhovensky. Without even raising his eyes, however, he went on cutting\r\nhis nails with perfect nonchalance.\r\n\r\n\"Why is it rot?\" The lame man took it up instantly, as though he had\r\nbeen lying in wait for his first words to catch at them.","\"Why is it\r\nrot? Mr. Shigalov is somewhat fanatical in his love for humanity, but\r\nremember that Fourier, still more Cabet and even Proudhon himself,\r\nadvocated a number of the most despotic and even fantastic measures. Mr.\r\nShigalov is perhaps far more sober in his suggestions than they are. I\r\nassure you that when one reads his book it's almost impossible not to\r\nagree with some things. He is perhaps less far from realism than anyone\r\nand his earthly paradise is almost the real one--if it ever existed--for\r\nthe loss of which man is always sighing.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew I was in for something,\" Verhovensky muttered again.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me,\" said the lame man, getting more and more excited.\r\n\"Conversations and arguments about the future organisation of society\r\nare almost an actual necessity for all thinking people nowadays. Herzen\r\nwas occupied with nothing else all his life. Byelinsky, as I know on\r\nvery good authority, used to spend whole evenings with his friends\r\ndebating and settling beforehand even the minutest, so to speak,\r\ndomestic, details of the social organisation of the future.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Some people go crazy over it,\" the major observed suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"We are more likely to arrive at something by talking, anyway, than by\r\nsitting silent and posing as dictators,\" Liputin hissed, as though at\r\nlast venturing to begin the attack.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mean Shigalov when I said it was rot,\" Verhovensky mumbled.\r\n\"You see, gentlemen,\"--he raised his eyes a trifle--\"to my mind all\r\nthese books, Fourier, Cabet, all this talk about the right to work,\r\nand Shigalov's theories--are all like novels of which one can write a\r\nhundred thousand--an √¶sthetic entertainment.","I can understand that in\r\nthis little town you are bored, so you rush to ink and paper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me,\" said the lame man, wriggling on his chair, \"though we are\r\nprovincials and of course objects of commiseration on that ground, yet\r\nwe know that so far nothing has happened in the world new enough to be\r\nworth our weeping at having missed it. It is suggested to us in various\r\npamphlets made abroad and secretly distributed that we should unite\r\nand form groups with the sole object of bringing about universal\r\ndestruction.","It's urged that, however much you tinker with the world,\r\nyou can't make a good job of it, but that by cutting off a hundred\r\nmillion heads and so lightening one's burden, one can jump over the\r\nditch more safely. A fine idea, no doubt, but quite as impracticable as\r\nShigalov's theories, which you referred to just now so contemptuously.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but I haven't come here for discussion.\" Verhovensky let drop\r\nthis significant phrase, and, as though quite unaware of his blunder,\r\ndrew the candle nearer to him that he might see better.","\"It's a pity, a great pity, that you haven't come for discussion, and\r\nit's a great pity that you are so taken up just now with your toilet.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's my toilet to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"To remove a hundred million heads is as difficult as to transform the\r\nworld by propaganda. Possibly more difficult, especially in Russia,\"\r\nLiputin ventured again.\r\n\r\n\"It's Russia they rest their hopes on now,\" said an officer.","\"We've heard they are resting their hopes on it,\" interposed the lame\r\nman. \"We know that a mysterious finger is pointing to our delightful\r\ncountry as the land most fitted to accomplish the great task. But\r\nthere's this: by the gradual solution of the problem by propaganda I\r\nshall gain something, anyway--I shall have some pleasant talk, at least,\r\nand shall even get some recognition from government for my services\r\nto the cause of society.","But in the second way, by the rapid method\r\nof cutting off a hundred million heads, what benefit shall I get\r\npersonally? If you began advocating that, your tongue might be cut out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yours certainly would be,\" observed Verhovensky.\r\n\r\n\"You see. And as under the most favourable circumstances you would not\r\nget through such a massacre in less than fifty or at the best thirty\r\nyears--for they are not sheep, you know, and perhaps they would not let\r\nthemselves be slaughtered--wouldn't it be better to pack one's bundle\r\nand migrate to some quiet island beyond calm seas and there close one's\r\neyes tranquilly? Believe me\"--he tapped the table significantly with his\r\nfinger--\"you will only promote emigration by such propaganda and nothing\r\nelse!\"\r\n\r\nHe finished evidently triumphant.","He was one of the intellects of the\r\nprovince. Liputin smiled slyly, Virginsky listened rather dejectedly,\r\nthe others followed the discussion with great attention, especially the\r\nladies and officers. They all realised that the advocate of the hundred\r\nmillion heads theory had been driven into a corner, and waited to see\r\nwhat would come of it.\r\n\r\n\"That was a good saying of yours, though,\" Verhovensky mumbled\r\nmore carelessly than ever, in fact with an air of positive boredom.","\"Emigration is a good idea. But all the same, if in spite of all the\r\nobvious disadvantages you foresee, more and more come forward every day\r\nready to fight for the common cause, it will be able to do without you.\r\nIt's a new religion, my good friend, coming to take the place of the old\r\none. That's why so many fighters come forward, and it's a big movement.\r\nYou'd better emigrate! And, you know, I should advise Dresden, not 'the\r\ncalm islands.","' To begin with, it's a town that has never been visited by\r\nan epidemic, and as you are a man of culture, no doubt you are afraid\r\nof death. Another thing, it's near the Russian frontier, so you can more\r\neasily receive your income from your beloved Fatherland. Thirdly,\r\nit contains what are called treasures of art, and you are a man of\r\n√¶sthetic tastes, formerly a teacher of literature, I believe.","And,\r\nfinally, it has a miniature Switzerland of its own--to provide you\r\nwith poetic inspiration, for no doubt you write verse. In fact it's a\r\ntreasure in a nutshell!\" There was a general movement, especially among\r\nthe officers. In another instant they would have all begun talking at\r\nonce. But the lame man rose irritably to the bait.\r\n\r\n\"No, perhaps I am not going to give up the common cause. You must\r\nunderstand that.","..\"\r\n\r\n\"What, would you join the quintet if I proposed it to you?\" Verhovensky\r\nboomed suddenly, and he laid down the scissors.\r\n\r\nEvery one seemed startled. The mysterious man had revealed himself too\r\nfreely. He had even spoken openly of the \"quintet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every one feels himself to be an honest man and will not shirk his part\r\nin the common cause\"--the lame man tried to wriggle out of it--\"but..",".\"\r\n\r\n\"No, this is not a question which allows of a _but_,\" Verhovensky\r\ninterrupted harshly and peremptorily. \"I tell you, gentlemen, I must\r\nhave a direct answer. I quite understand that, having come here and\r\nhaving called you together myself, I am bound to give you explanations\"\r\n(again an unexpected revelation), \"but I can give you none till I know\r\nwhat is your attitude to the subject. To cut the matter short--for we\r\ncan't go on talking for another thirty years as people have done for the\r\nlast thirty--I ask you which you prefer: the slow way, which consists in\r\nthe composition of socialistic romances and the academic ordering of\r\nthe destinies of humanity a thousand years hence, while despotism will\r\nswallow the savoury morsels which would almost fly into your mouths of\r\nthemselves if you'd take a little trouble; or do you, whatever it may\r\nimply, prefer a quicker way which will at last untie your hands, and\r\nwill let humanity make its own social organisation in freedom and in\r\naction, not on paper? They shout 'a hundred million heads'; that may be\r\nonly a metaphor; but why be afraid of it if, with the slow day-dream on\r\npaper, despotism in the course of some hundred years will devour not a\r\nhundred but five hundred million heads? Take note too that an incurable\r\ninvalid will not be cured whatever prescriptions are written for him on\r\npaper.","On the contrary, if there is delay, he will grow so corrupt that\r\nhe will infect us too and contaminate all the fresh forces which one\r\nmight still reckon upon now, so that we shall all at last come to grief\r\ntogether. I thoroughly agree that it's extremely agreeable to chatter\r\nliberally and eloquently, but action is a little trying.... However, I\r\nam no hand at talking; I came here with communications, and so I beg\r\nall the honourable company not to vote, but simply and directly to state\r\nwhich you prefer: walking at a snail's pace in the marsh, or putting on\r\nfull steam to get across it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am certainly for crossing at full steam!\" cried the schoolboy in an\r\necstasy.","\"So am I,\" Lyamshin chimed in.\r\n\r\n\"There can be no doubt about the choice,\" muttered an officer, followed\r\nby another, then by someone else. What struck them all most was that\r\nVerhovensky had come \"with communications\" and had himself just promised\r\nto speak.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, I see that almost all decide for the policy of the\r\nmanifestoes,\" he said, looking round at the company.\r\n\r\n\"All, all!\" cried the majority of voices.","\"I confess I am rather in favour of a more humane policy,\" said the\r\nmajor, \"but as all are on the other side, I go with all the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"It appears, then, that even you are not opposed to it,\" said\r\nVerhovensky, addressing the lame man.\r\n\r\n\"I am not exactly...\" said the latter, turning rather red, \"but if I do\r\nagree with the rest now, it's simply not to break up--\"\r\n\r\n\"You are all like that! Ready to argue for six months to practise\r\nyour Liberal eloquence and in the end you vote the same as the rest!\r\nGentlemen, consider though, is it true that you are all ready?\"\r\n\r\n(Ready for what? The question was vague, but very alluring.",")\r\n\r\n\"All are, of course!\" voices were heard. But all were looking at one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\"But afterwards perhaps you will resent having agreed so quickly? That's\r\nalmost always the way with you.\"\r\n\r\nThe company was excited in various ways, greatly excited. The lame man\r\nflew at him.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to observe, however, that answers to such questions are\r\nconditional. Even if we have given our decision, you must note that\r\nquestions put in such a strange way.","..\"\r\n\r\n\"In what strange way?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a way such questions are not asked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Teach me how, please. But do you know, I felt sure you'd be the first\r\nto take offence.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've extracted from us an answer as to our readiness for immediate\r\naction; but what right had you to do so? By what authority do you ask\r\nsuch questions?\"\r\n\r\n\"You should have thought of asking that question sooner! Why did you\r\nanswer? You agree and then you go back on it!\"\r\n\r\n\"But to my mind the irresponsibility of your principal question suggests\r\nto me that you have no authority, no right, and only asked from personal\r\ncuriosity.","\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean? What do you mean?\" cried Verhovensky, apparently\r\nbeginning to be much alarmed.\r\n\r\n\"Why, that the initiation of new members into anything you like is done,\r\nanyway, _t√™te-√†-t√™te_ and not in the company of twenty people one doesn't\r\nknow!\" blurted out the lame man. He had said all that was in his mind\r\nbecause he was too irritated to restrain himself. Verhovensky turned to\r\nthe general company with a capitally simulated look of alarm.","\"Gentlemen, I deem it my duty to declare that all this is folly, and\r\nthat our conversation has gone too far. I have so far initiated no one,\r\nand no one has the right to say of me that I initiate members. We were\r\nsimply discussing our opinions. That's so, isn't it? But whether that's\r\nso or not, you alarm me very much.\" He turned to the lame man again.\r\n\"I had no idea that it was unsafe here to speak of such practically\r\ninnocent matters except _t√™te-√†-t√™te_.","Are you afraid of informers? Can\r\nthere possibly be an informer among us here?\"\r\n\r\nThe excitement became tremendous; all began talking.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, if that is so,\" Verhovensky went on, \"I have compromised\r\nmyself more than anyone, and so I will ask you to answer one question,\r\nif you care to, of course. You are all perfectly free.\"\r\n\r\n\"What question? What question?\" every one clamoured.\r\n\r\n\"A question that will make it clear whether we are to remain together,\r\nor take up our hats and go our several ways without speaking.","\"\r\n\r\n\"The question! The question!\"\r\n\r\n\"If any one of us knew of a proposed political murder, would he, in view\r\nof all the consequences, go to give information, or would he stay at\r\nhome and await events? Opinions may differ on this point. The answer\r\nto the question will tell us clearly whether we are to separate, or to\r\nremain together and for far longer than this one evening. Let me appeal\r\nto you first.","\" He turned to the lame man.\r\n\r\n\"Why to me first?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you began it all. Be so good as not to prevaricate; it won't\r\nhelp you to be cunning. But please yourself, it's for you to decide.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, but such a question is positively insulting.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, can't you be more exact than that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've never been an agent of the Secret Police,\" replied the latter,\r\nwriggling more than ever.\r\n\r\n\"Be so good as to be more definite, don't keep us waiting.","\"\r\n\r\nThe lame man was so furious that he left off answering. Without a word\r\nhe glared wrathfully from under his spectacles at his tormentor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes or no? Would you inform or not?\" cried Verhovensky.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I wouldn't,\" the lame man shouted twice as loudly.\r\n\r\n\"And no one would, of course not!\" cried many voices.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to appeal to you, Mr. Major. Would you inform or not?\"\r\nVerhovensky went on.","\"And note that I appeal to you on purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't inform.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if you knew that someone meant to rob and murder someone else, an\r\nordinary mortal, then you would inform and give warning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course; but that's a private affair, while the other would be a\r\npolitical treachery. I've never been an agent of the Secret Police.\"\r\n\r\n\"And no one here has,\" voices cried again. \"It's an unnecessary\r\nquestion.","Every one will make the same answer. There are no informers\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that gentleman getting up for?\" cried the girl-student.\r\n\r\n\"That's Shatov. What are you getting up for?\" cried the lady of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nShatov did, in fact, stand up. He was holding his cap in his hand and\r\nlooking at Verhovensky. Apparently he wanted to say something to him,\r\nbut was hesitating. His face was pale and wrathful, but he controlled\r\nhimself.","He did not say one word, but in silence walked towards the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\"Shatov, this won't make things better for you!\" Verhovensky called\r\nafter him enigmatically.\r\n\r\n\"But it will for you, since you are a spy and a scoundrel!\" Shatov\r\nshouted to him from the door, and he went out.\r\n\r\nShouts and exclamations again.\r\n\r\n\"That's what comes of a test,\" cried a voice.\r\n\r\n\"It's been of use,\" cried another.","\"Hasn't it been of use too late?\" observed a third.\r\n\r\n\"Who invited him? Who let him in? Who is he? Who is Shatov? Will he\r\ninform, or won't he?\" There was a shower of questions.\r\n\r\n\"If he were an informer he would have kept up appearances instead of\r\ncursing it all and going away,\" observed someone.\r\n\r\n\"See, Stavrogin is getting up too. Stavrogin has not answered the\r\nquestion either,\" cried the girl-student.","Stavrogin did actually stand up, and at the other end of the table\r\nKirillov rose at the same time.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Stavrogin,\" Madame Virginsky addressed him sharply, \"we\r\nall answered the question, while you are going away without a word.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see no necessity to answer the question which interests you,\"\r\nmuttered Stavrogin.\r\n\r\n\"But we've compromised ourselves and you won't,\" shouted several voices.","\"What business is it of mine if you have compromised yourselves?\"\r\nlaughed Stavrogin, but his eyes flashed.\r\n\r\n\"What business? What business?\" voices exclaimed.\r\n\r\nMany people got up from their chairs.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me, gentlemen, allow me,\" cried the lame man. \"Mr. Verhovensky\r\nhasn't answered the question either; he has only asked it.\"\r\n\r\nThe remark produced a striking effect. All looked at one another.","Stavrogin laughed aloud in the lame man's face and went out; Kirillov\r\nfollowed him; Verhovensky ran after them into the passage.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing?\" he faltered, seizing Stavrogin's hand and gripping\r\nit with all his might in his. Stavrogin pulled away his hand without a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\"Be at Kirillov's directly, I'll come.... It's absolutely necessary\r\nfor me to see you!...\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't necessary for me,\" Stavrogin cut him short.","\"Stavrogin will be there,\" Kirillov said finally. \"Stavrogin, it is\r\nnecessary for you. I will show you that there.\"\r\n\r\nThey went out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. IVAN THE TSAREVITCH\r\n\r\n\r\nThey had gone. Pyotr Stepanovitch was about to rush back to the meeting\r\nto bring order into chaos, but probably reflecting that it wasn't worth\r\nbothering about, left everything, and two minutes later was flying after\r\nthe other two.","On the way he remembered a short cut to Filipov's house.\r\nHe rushed along it, up to his knees in mud, and did in fact arrive at\r\nthe very moment when Stavrogin and Kirillov were coming in at the gate.\r\n\r\n\"You here already?\" observed Kirillov. \"That's good. Come in.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is it you told us you lived alone,\" asked Stavrogin, passing a\r\nboiling samovar in the passage.\r\n\r\n\"You will see directly who it is I live with,\" muttered Kirillov.","\"Go\r\nin.\"\r\n\r\nThey had hardly entered when Verhovensky at once took out of his pocket\r\nthe anonymous letter he had taken from Lembke, and laid it before\r\nStavrogin. They all then sat down. Stavrogin read the letter in silence.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"That scoundrel will do as he writes,\" Verhovensky explained. \"So, as\r\nhe is under your control, tell me how to act. I assure you he may go to\r\nLembke to-morrow.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let him go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him go! And when we can prevent him, too!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken. He is not dependent on me. Besides, I don't care; he\r\ndoesn't threaten me in any way; he only threatens you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there are other people who may not spare you. Surely you understand\r\nthat? Listen, Stavrogin. This is only playing with words. Surely you\r\ndon't grudge the money?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, would it cost money?\"\r\n\r\n\"It certainly would; two thousand or at least fifteen hundred.","Give it\r\nto me to-morrow or even to-day, and to-morrow evening I'll send him to\r\nPetersburg for you. That's just what he wants. If you like, he can take\r\nMarya Timofyevna. Note that.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something distracted about him. He spoke, as it were, without\r\ncaution, and he did not reflect on his words. Stavrogin watched him,\r\nwondering.\r\n\r\n\"I've no reason to send Marya Timofyevna away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you don't even want to,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch smiled ironically.","\"Perhaps I don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"In short, will there be the money or not?\" he cried with angry\r\nimpatience, and as it were peremptorily, to Stavrogin. The latter\r\nscrutinised him gravely. \"There won't be the money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Stavrogin! You know something, or have done something\r\nalready! You are going it!\"\r\n\r\nHis face worked, the corners of his mouth twitched, and he suddenly\r\nlaughed an unprovoked and irrelevant laugh.","\"But you've had money from your father for the estate,\" Stavrogin\r\nobserved calmly. \"Maman sent you six or eight thousand for Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch. So you can pay the fifteen hundred out of your own money.\r\nI don't care to pay for other people. I've given a lot as it is.\r\nIt annoys me....\" He smiled himself at his own words.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you are beginning to joke!\"\r\n\r\nStavrogin got up from his chair.","Verhovensky instantly jumped up too,\r\nand mechanically stood with his back to the door as though barring the\r\nway to him. Stavrogin had already made a motion to push him aside and go\r\nout, when he stopped short.\r\n\r\n\"I won't give up Shatov to you,\" he said. Pyotr Stepanovitch started.\r\nThey looked at one another.\r\n\r\n\"I told you this evening why you needed Shatov's blood,\" said Stavrogin,\r\nwith flashing eyes.","\"It's the cement you want to bind your groups\r\ntogether with. You drove Shatov away cleverly just now. You knew very\r\nwell that he wouldn't promise not to inform and he would have thought it\r\nmean to lie to you. But what do you want with me? What do you want with\r\nme? Ever since we met abroad you won't let me alone. The explanation\r\nyou've given me so far was simply raving. Meanwhile you are driving\r\nat my giving Lebyadkin fifteen hundred roubles, so as to give Fedka an\r\nopportunity to murder him.","I know that you think I want my wife murdered\r\ntoo. You think to tie my hands by this crime, and have me in your power.\r\nThat's it, isn't it? What good will that be to you? What the devil do\r\nyou want with me? Look at me. Once for all, am I the man for you? And\r\nlet me alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has Fedka been to you himself?\" Verhovensky asked breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he came. His price is fifteen hundred too....","But here; he'll\r\nrepeat it himself. There he stands.\" Stavrogin stretched out his hand.\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch turned round quickly. A new figure, Fedka, wearing a\r\nsheep-skin coat, but without a cap, as though he were at home, stepped\r\nout of the darkness in the doorway. He stood there laughing and showing\r\nhis even white teeth. His black eyes, with yellow whites, darted\r\ncautiously about the room watching the gentlemen.","There was something he\r\ndid not understand. He had evidently been just brought in by Kirillov,\r\nand his inquiring eyes turned to the latter. He stood in the doorway,\r\nbut was unwilling to come into the room.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you got him ready here to listen to our bargaining, or\r\nthat he may actually see the money in our hands. Is that it?\" asked\r\nStavrogin; and without waiting for an answer he walked out of the house.","Verhovensky, almost frantic, overtook him at the gate.\r\n\r\n\"Stop! Not another step!\" he cried, seizing him by the arm. Stavrogin\r\ntried to pull away his arm, but did not succeed. He was overcome with\r\nfury. Seizing Verhovensky by the hair with his left hand he flung him\r\nwith all his might on the ground and went out at the gate. But he had\r\nnot gone thirty paces before Verhovensky overtook him again.","\"Let us make it up; let us make it up!\" he murmured in a spasmodic\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\nStavrogin shrugged his shoulders, but neither answered nor turned round.\r\n\r\n\"Listen. I will bring you Lizaveta Nikolaevna to-morrow; shall I? No?\r\nWhy don't you answer? Tell me what you want. I'll do it. Listen. I'll\r\nlet you have Shatov. Shall I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it's true that you meant to kill him?\" cried Stavrogin.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want with Shatov? What is he to you?\" Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\nwent on, gasping, speaking rapidly.","He was in a frenzy, and kept running\r\nforward and seizing Stavrogin by the elbow, probably unaware of what he\r\nwas doing. \"Listen. I'll let you have him. Let's make it up. Your price\r\nis a very great one, but... Let's make it up!\"\r\n\r\nStavrogin glanced at him at last, and was amazed. The eyes, the voice,\r\nwere not the same as always, or as they had been in the room just now.\r\nWhat he saw was almost another face.","The intonation of the voice was\r\ndifferent. Verhovensky besought, implored. He was a man from whom what\r\nwas most precious was being taken or had been taken, and who was still\r\nstunned by the shock.\r\n\r\n\"But what's the matter with you?\" cried Stavrogin. The other did not\r\nanswer, but ran after him and gazed at him with the same imploring but\r\nyet inflexible expression.\r\n\r\n\"Let's make it up!\" he whispered once more.","\"Listen. Like Fedka, I have\r\na knife in my boot, but I'll make it up with you!\"\r\n\r\n\"But what do you want with me, damn you?\" Stavrogin cried, with intense\r\nanger and amazement. \"Is there some mystery about it? Am I a sort of\r\ntalisman for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen. We are going to make a revolution,\" the other muttered rapidly,\r\nand almost in delirium. \"You don't believe we shall make a revolution?\r\nWe are going to make such an upheaval that everything will be uprooted\r\nfrom its foundation.","Karmazinov is right that there is nothing to lay\r\nhold of. Karmazinov is very intelligent. Another ten such groups in\r\ndifferent parts of Russia--and I am safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Groups of fools like that?\" broke reluctantly from Stavrogin.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't be so clever, Stavrogin; don't be so clever yourself. And you\r\nknow you are by no means so intelligent that you need wish others to\r\nbe. You are afraid, you have no faith.","You are frightened at our doing\r\nthings on such a scale. And why are they fools? They are not such fools.\r\nNo one has a mind of his own nowadays. There are terribly few original\r\nminds nowadays. Virginsky is a pure-hearted man, ten times as pure as\r\nyou or I; but never mind about him. Liputin is a rogue, but I know one\r\npoint about him. Every rogue has some point in him.... Lyamshin is the\r\nonly one who hasn't, but he is in my hands.","A few more groups, and I\r\nshould have money and passports everywhere; so much at least. Suppose it\r\nwere only that? And safe places, so that they can search as they like.\r\nThey might uproot one group but they'd stick at the next. We'll set\r\nthings in a ferment.... Surely you don't think that we two are not\r\nenough?\"\r\n\r\n\"Take Shigalov, and let me alone....\"\r\n\r\n\"Shigalov is a man of genius! Do you know he is a genius like Fourier,\r\nbut bolder than Fourier; stronger.","I'll look after him. He's discovered\r\n'equality'!\"\r\n\r\n\"He is in a fever; he is raving; something very queer has happened\r\nto him,\" thought Stavrogin, looking at him once more. Both walked on\r\nwithout stopping.\r\n\r\n\"He's written a good thing in that manuscript,\" Verhovensky went on. \"He\r\nsuggests a system of spying. Every member of the society spies on the\r\nothers, and it's his duty to inform against them.","Every one belongs to\r\nall and all to every one. All are slaves and equal in their slavery. In\r\nextreme cases he advocates slander and murder, but the great thing about\r\nit is equality. To begin with, the level of education, science, and\r\ntalents is lowered. A high level of education and science is only\r\npossible for great intellects, and they are not wanted. The great\r\nintellects have always seized the power and been despots.","Great\r\nintellects cannot help being despots and they've always done more harm\r\nthan good. They will be banished or put to death. Cicero will have his\r\ntongue cut out, Copernicus will have his eyes put out, Shakespeare will\r\nbe stoned--that's Shigalovism. Slaves are bound to be equal. There has\r\nnever been either freedom or equality without despotism, but in the herd\r\nthere is bound to be equality, and that's Shigalovism! Ha ha ha! Do you\r\nthink it strange? I am for Shigalovism.","\"\r\n\r\nStavrogin tried to quicken his pace, and to reach home as soon as\r\npossible. \"If this fellow is drunk, where did he manage to get drunk?\"\r\ncrossed his mind. \"Can it be the brandy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Stavrogin. To level the mountains is a fine idea, not an absurd\r\none. I am for Shigalov. Down with culture. We've had enough science!\r\nWithout science we have material enough to go on for a thousand years,\r\nbut one must have discipline.","The one thing wanting in the world is\r\ndiscipline. The thirst for culture is an aristocratic thirst. The moment\r\nyou have family ties or love you get the desire for property. We will\r\ndestroy that desire; we'll make use of drunkenness, slander, spying;\r\nwe'll make use of incredible corruption; we'll stifle every genius\r\nin its infancy. We'll reduce all to a common denominator! Complete\r\nequality! 'We've learned a trade, and we are honest men; we need nothing\r\nmore,' that was an answer given by English working-men recently.","Only the necessary is necessary, that's the motto of the whole world\r\nhenceforward. But it needs a shock. That's for us, the directors, to\r\nlook after. Slaves must have directors. Absolute submission, absolute\r\nloss of individuality, but once in thirty years Shigalov would let them\r\nhave a shock and they would all suddenly begin eating one another up, to\r\na certain point, simply as a precaution against boredom.","Boredom is an\r\naristocratic sensation. The Shigalovians will have no desires. Desire\r\nand suffering are our lot, but Shigalovism is for the slaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"You exclude yourself?\" Stavrogin broke in again.\r\n\r\n\"You, too. Do you know, I have thought of giving up the world to the\r\nPope. Let him come forth, on foot, and barefoot, and show himself to the\r\nrabble, saying, 'See what they have brought me to!' and they will all\r\nrush after him, even the troops.","The Pope at the head, with us\r\nround him, and below us--Shigalovism. All that's needed is that the\r\nInternationale should come to an agreement with the Pope; so it will.\r\nAnd the old chap will agree at once. There's nothing else he can do.\r\nRemember my words! Ha ha! Is it stupid? Tell me, is it stupid or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's enough!\" Stavrogin muttered with vexation.\r\n\r\n\"Enough! Listen. I've given up the Pope! Damn Shigalovism! Damn the\r\nPope! We must have something more everyday.","Not Shigalovism, for\r\nShigalovism is a rare specimen of the jeweller's art. It's an ideal;\r\nit's in the future. Shigalov is an artist and a fool like every\r\nphilanthropist. We need coarse work, and Shigalov despises coarse work.\r\nListen. The Pope shall be for the west, and you shall be for us, you\r\nshall be for us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me alone, you drunken fellow!\" muttered Stavrogin, and he quickened\r\nhis pace.","\"Stavrogin, you are beautiful,\" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch, almost\r\necstatically. \"Do you know that you are beautiful! What's the most\r\nprecious thing about you is that you sometimes don't know it. Oh,\r\nI've studied you! I often watch you on the sly! There's a lot of\r\nsimpleheartedness and na√Øvet√© about you still. Do you know that? There\r\nstill is, there is! You must be suffering and suffering genuinely from\r\nthat simple-heartedness.","I love beauty. I am a nihilist, but I love\r\nbeauty. Are nihilists incapable of loving beauty? It's only idols they\r\ndislike, but I love an idol. You are my idol! You injure no one, and\r\nevery one hates you. You treat every one as an equal, and yet every one\r\nis afraid of you--that's good. Nobody would slap you on the shoulder.\r\nYou are an awful aristocrat. An aristocrat is irresistible when he goes\r\nin for democracy! To sacrifice life, your own or another's is nothing\r\nto you.","You are just the man that's needed. It's just such a man as you\r\nthat I need. I know no one but you. You are the leader, you are the sun\r\nand I am your worm.\"\r\n\r\nHe suddenly kissed his hand. A shiver ran down Stavrogin's spine, and he\r\npulled away his hand in dismay. They stood still.\r\n\r\n\"Madman!\" whispered Stavrogin.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I am raving; perhaps I am raving,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch assented,\r\nspeaking rapidly.","\"But I've thought of the first step! Shigalov would\r\nnever have thought of it. There are lots of Shigalovs, but only one man,\r\none man in Russia has hit on the first step and knows how to take it.\r\nAnd I am that man! Why do you look at me? I need you, you; without you\r\nI am nothing. Without you I am a fly, a bottled idea; Columbus without\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\nStavrogin stood still and looked intently into his wild eyes.","\"Listen. First of all we'll make an upheaval,\" Verhovensky went on in\r\ndesperate haste, continually clutching at Stavrogin's left sleeve. \"I've\r\nalready told you. We shall penetrate to the peasantry. Do you know that\r\nwe are tremendously powerful already? Our party does not consist only of\r\nthose who commit murder and arson, fire off pistols in the traditional\r\nfashion, or bite colonels. They are only a hindrance.","I don't accept\r\nanything without discipline. I am a scoundrel, of course, and not a\r\nsocialist. Ha ha! Listen. I've reckoned them all up: a teacher who\r\nlaughs with children at their God and at their cradle is on our side.\r\nThe lawyer who defends an educated murderer because he is more cultured\r\nthan his victims and could not help murdering them to get money is one\r\nof us. The schoolboys who murder a peasant for the sake of sensation are\r\nours.","The juries who acquit every criminal are ours. The prosecutor who\r\ntrembles at a trial for fear he should not seem advanced enough is ours,\r\nours. Among officials and literary men we have lots, lots, and they\r\ndon't know it themselves. On the other hand, the docility of schoolboys\r\nand fools has reached an extreme pitch; the schoolmasters are bitter\r\nand bilious. On all sides we see vanity puffed up out of all proportion;\r\nbrutal, monstrous appetites.","... Do you know how many we shall catch by\r\nlittle, ready-made ideas? When I left Russia, Littre's dictum that crime\r\nis insanity was all the rage; I come back and I find that crime is\r\nno longer insanity, but simply common sense, almost a duty; anyway,\r\na gallant protest. 'How can we expect a cultured man not to commit a\r\nmurder, if he is in need of money.' But these are only the first fruits.\r\nThe Russian God has already been vanquished by cheap vodka.","The peasants\r\nare drunk, the mothers are drunk, the children are drunk, the churches\r\nare empty, and in the peasant courts one hears, 'Two hundred lashes or\r\nstand us a bucket of vodka.' Oh, this generation has only to grow up.\r\nIt's only a pity we can't afford to wait, or we might have let them get\r\na bit more tipsy! Ah, what a pity there's no proletariat! But there will\r\nbe, there will be; we are going that way.","...\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a pity, too, that we've grown greater fools,\" muttered Stavrogin,\r\nmoving forward as before.\r\n\r\n\"Listen. I've seen a child of six years old leading home his drunken\r\nmother, whilst she swore at him with foul words. Do you suppose I am\r\nglad of that? When it's in our hands, maybe we'll mend things... if need\r\nbe, we'll drive them for forty years into the wilderness.... But one\r\nor two generations of vice are essential now; monstrous, abject vice by\r\nwhich a man is transformed into a loathsome, cruel, egoistic reptile.","That's what we need! And what's more, a little 'fresh blood' that we\r\nmay get accustomed to it. Why are you laughing? I am not contradicting\r\nmyself. I am only contradicting the philanthropists and Shigalovism,\r\nnot myself! I am a scoundrel, not a socialist. Ha ha ha! I'm only sorry\r\nthere's no time. I promised Karmazinov to begin in May, and to make an\r\nend by October. Is that too soon? Ha ha! Do you know what, Stavrogin?\r\nThough the Russian people use foul language, there's nothing cynical\r\nabout them so far.","Do you know the serfs had more self-respect than\r\nKarmazinov? Though they were beaten they always preserved their gods,\r\nwhich is more than Karmazinov's done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Verhovensky, this is the first time I've heard you talk, and I\r\nlisten with amazement,\" observed Stavrogin. \"So you are really not a\r\nsocialist, then, but some sort of... ambitious politician?\"\r\n\r\n\"A scoundrel, a scoundrel! You are wondering what I am.","I'll tell you\r\nwhat I am directly, that's what I am leading up to. It was not for\r\nnothing that I kissed your hand. But the people must believe that we\r\nknow what we are after, while the other side do nothing but 'brandish\r\ntheir cudgels and beat their own followers.' Ah, if we only had more\r\ntime! That's the only trouble, we have no time. We will proclaim\r\ndestruction.... Why is it, why is it that idea has such a fascination.","But we must have a little exercise; we must. We'll set fires going....\r\nWe'll set legends going. Every scurvy 'group' will be of use. Out of\r\nthose very groups I'll pick you out fellows so keen they'll not shrink\r\nfrom shooting, and be grateful for the honour of a job, too. Well, and\r\nthere will be an upheaval! There's going to be such an upset as\r\nthe world has never seen before.... Russia will be overwhelmed with\r\ndarkness, the earth will weep for its old gods.","... Well, then we shall\r\nbring forward... whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ivan the Tsarevitch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who-m?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ivan the Tsarevitch. You! You!\"\r\n\r\nStavrogin thought a minute.\r\n\r\n\"A pretender?\" he asked suddenly, looking with intense surprise at his\r\nfrantic companion. \"Ah! so that's your plan at last!\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall say that he is 'in hiding,'\" Verhovensky said softly, in a\r\nsort of tender whisper, as though he really were drunk indeed.","\"Do you\r\nknow the magic of that phrase, 'he is in hiding'? But he will appear,\r\nhe will appear. We'll set a legend going better than the Skoptsis'. He\r\nexists, but no one has seen him. Oh, what a legend one can set going!\r\nAnd the great thing is it will be a new force at work! And we need that;\r\nthat's what they are crying for. What can Socialism do: it's destroyed\r\nthe old forces but hasn't brought in any new.","But in this we have a\r\nforce, and what a force! Incredible. We only need one lever to lift up\r\nthe earth. Everything will rise up!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then have you been seriously reckoning on me?\" Stavrogin said with a\r\nmalicious smile.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you laugh, and so spitefully? Don't frighten me. I am like a\r\nlittle child now. I can be frightened to death by one smile like that.\r\nListen. I'll let no one see you, no one.","So it must be. He exists, but\r\nno one has seen him; he is in hiding. And do you know, one might show\r\nyou, to one out of a hundred-thousand, for instance. And the rumour will\r\nspread over all the land, 'We've seen him, we've seen him.'\r\n\r\n\"Ivan Filipovitch the God of Sabaoth,* has been seen, too, when he\r\nascended into heaven in his chariot in the sight of men. They saw\r\nhim with their own eyes. And you are not an Ivan Filipovitch.","You are\r\nbeautiful and proud as a God; you are seeking nothing for yourself,\r\nwith the halo of a victim round you, 'in hiding.' The great thing is\r\nthe legend. You'll conquer them, you'll have only to look, and you will\r\nconquer them. He is 'in hiding,' and will come forth bringing a new\r\ntruth. And, meanwhile, we'll pass two or three judgments as wise\r\nas Solomon's. The groups, you know, the quintets--we've no need of\r\nnewspapers.","If out of ten thousand petitions only one is granted, all\r\nwould come with petitions. In every parish, every peasant will know that\r\nthere is somewhere a hollow tree where petitions are to be put. And the\r\nwhole land will resound with the cry, 'A new just law is to come,' and\r\nthe sea will be troubled and the whole gimcrack show will fall to the\r\nground, and then we shall consider how to build up an edifice of stone.","For the first time! We are going to build it, we, and only we!\"\r\n\r\n     * The reference is to the legend current in the sect of\r\n     Flagellants.--Translator's note.\r\n\r\n\"Madness,\" said Stavrogin.\r\n\r\n\"Why, why don't you want it? Are you afraid? That's why I caught at you,\r\nbecause you are afraid of nothing. Is it unreasonable? But you see, so\r\nfar I am Columbus without America. Would Columbus without America seem\r\nreasonable?\"\r\n\r\nStavrogin did not speak.","Meanwhile they had reached the house and\r\nstopped at the entrance.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" Verhovensky bent down to his ear. \"I'll do it for you without\r\nthe money. I'll settle Marya Timofyevna to-morrow!... Without the money,\r\nand to-morrow I'll bring you Liza. Will you have Liza to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he really mad?\" Stavrogin wondered smiling. The front door was\r\nopened.\r\n\r\n\"Stavrogin--is America ours?\" said Verhovensky, seizing his hand for the\r\nlast time.","\"What for?\" said Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, gravely and sternly.\r\n\r\n\"You don't care, I knew that!\" cried Verhovensky in an access of furious\r\nanger. \"You are lying, you miserable, profligate, perverted, little\r\naristocrat! I don't believe you, you've the appetite of a wolf!...\r\nUnderstand that you've cost me such a price, I can't give you up now!\r\nThere's no one on earth but you! I invented you abroad; I invented it\r\nall, looking at you.","If I hadn't watched you from my corner, nothing of\r\nall this would have entered my head!\"\r\n\r\nStavrogin went up the steps without answering.\r\n\r\n\"Stavrogin!\" Verhovensky called after him, \"I give you a day... two,\r\nthen... three, then; more than three I can't--and then you're to\r\nanswer!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. A RAID AT STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH'S\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile an incident had occurred which astounded me and shattered\r\nStepan Trofimovitch.","At eight o'clock in the morning Nastasya ran round\r\nto me from him with the news that her master was \"raided.\" At first I\r\ncould not make out what she meant; I could only gather that the \"raid\"\r\nwas carried out by officials, that they had come and taken his papers,\r\nand that a soldier had tied them up in a bundle and \"wheeled them away\r\nin a barrow.\" It was a fantastic story. I hurried at once to Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch.","I found him in a surprising condition: upset and in great agitation, but\r\nat the same time unmistakably triumphant. On the table in the middle of\r\nthe room the samovar was boiling, and there was a glass of tea poured\r\nout but untouched and forgotten. Stepan Trofimovitch was wandering round\r\nthe table and peeping into every corner of the room, unconscious of what\r\nhe was doing. He was wearing his usual red knitted jacket, but seeing\r\nme, he hurriedly put on his coat and waistcoat--a thing he had never\r\ndone before when any of his intimate friends found him in his jacket.","He\r\ntook me warmly by the hand at once.\r\n\r\n_\"Enfin un ami!\"_ (He heaved a deep sigh.) \"_Cher,_ I've sent to you only,\r\nand no one knows anything. We must give Nastasya orders to lock the\r\ndoors and not admit anyone, except, of course them.... _Vous comprenez?_\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me uneasily, as though expecting a reply. I made haste, of\r\ncourse, to question him, and from his disconnected and broken sentences,\r\nfull of unnecessary parentheses, I succeeded in learning that at seven\r\no'clock that morning an official of the province had 'all of a sudden'\r\ncalled on him.","\"_Pardon, j'ai oubli√© son nom. Il n'est pas du pays,_ but I think he came\r\nto the town with Lembke, _quelque chose de b√™te et d'Allemand dans la\r\nphysionomie. Il s'appelle Rosenthal._\"\r\n\r\n\"Wasn't it Blum?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that was his name. _Vous le connaissez? Quelque chose d'h√©b√©t√© et\r\nde tr√®s content dans la figure, pourtant tr√®s sev√®re, roide et s√©rieux._\r\nA type of the police, of the submissive subordinates, _je m'y connais.","_ I\r\nwas still asleep, and, would you believe it, he asked to have a look at\r\nmy books and manuscripts! _Oui, je m'en souviens, il a employ√© ce mot._ He\r\ndid not arrest me, but only the books. _Il se tenait √† distance,_ and when\r\nhe began to explain his visit he looked as though I... _enfin il\r\navait l'air de croire que je tomberai sur lui imm√©diatement et que je\r\ncommencerai a le battre comme pl√¢tre.","Tous ces gens du bas √©tage sont\r\ncomme √ßa_ when they have to do with a gentleman. I need hardly say I\r\nunderstood it all at once. _Voil√† vingt ans que je m'y pr√©pare._ I opened\r\nall the drawers and handed him all the keys; I gave them myself, I gave\r\nhim all. _J'√©tais digne et calme._ From the books he took the foreign\r\nedition of Herzen, the bound volume of _The Bell,_ four copies of my poem,\r\n_et enfin tout √ßa.","_ Then he took my letters and my papers _et quelques-unes\r\nde mes √©bauches historiques, critiques et politiques._ All that they\r\ncarried off. Nastasya says that a soldier wheeled them away in a barrow\r\nand covered them with an apron; _oui, c'est cela,_ with an apron.\" It\r\nsounded like delirium. Who could make head or tail of it? I pelted him\r\nwith questions again. Had Blum come alone, or with others? On whose\r\nauthority? By what right? How had he dared? How did he explain it?\r\n\r\n\"_Il etait seul, bien seul,_ but there was someone else _dans\r\nl'antichambre, oui, je m'en souviens, et puis.",".._ Though I believe there\r\nwas someone else besides, and there was a guard standing in the entry.\r\nYou must ask Nastasya; she knows all about it better than I do. _J'√©tais\r\nsurexcit√©, voyez-vous. Il parlait, il parlait... un tas de chases_; he\r\nsaid very little though, it was I said all that.... I told him the\r\nstory of my life, simply from that point of view, of course. _J'√©tais\r\nsurexcit√©, mais digne, je vous assure.","..._ I am afraid, though, I may\r\nhave shed tears. They got the barrow from the shop next door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, heavens! how could all this have happened? But for mercy's sake,\r\nspeak more exactly, Stepan Trofimovitch. What you tell me sounds like a\r\ndream.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Cher,_ I feel as though I were in a dream myself.... _Savez-vous! Il\r\na prononc√© le nom de Telyatnikof,_ and I believe that that man was\r\nconcealed in the entry.","Yes, I remember, he suggested calling the\r\nprosecutor and Dmitri Dmitritch, I believe... _qui me doit encore quinze\r\nroubles_ I won at cards, _soit dit en passant. Enfin, je n'ai pas trop\r\ncompris._ But I got the better of them, and what do I care for Dmitri\r\nDmitritch? I believe I begged him very earnestly to keep it quiet;\r\nI begged him particularly, most particularly. I am afraid I demeaned\r\nmyself, in fact, _comment croyez-vous? Enfin il a consenti.","_ Yes, I\r\nremember, he suggested that himself--that it would be better to keep it\r\nquiet, for he had only come 'to have a look round' _et rien de plus,_ and\r\nnothing more, nothing more... and that if they find nothing, nothing\r\nwill happen. So that we ended it all _en amis, je suis tout √† fait\r\ncontent._\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then he suggested the usual course of proceedings in such cases\r\nand regular guarantees, and you rejected them yourself,\" I cried with\r\nfriendly indignation.","\"Yes, it's better without the guarantees. And why make a scandal? Let's\r\nkeep it _en amis_ so long as we can. You know, in our town, if they get to\r\nknow it... _mes ennemis, et puis, √† quoi bon, le procureur, ce cochon de\r\nnotre procureur, qui deux fois m'a manqu√© de politesse et qu'on a ross√©\r\n√† plaisir l'autre ann√©e chez cette charmante et belle Natalya Pavlovna\r\nquand il se cacha dans son boudoir.","Et puis, mon ami,_ don't make\r\nobjections and don't depress me, I beg you, for nothing is more\r\nunbearable when a man is in trouble than for a hundred friends to point\r\nout to him what a fool he has made of himself. Sit down though and have\r\nsome tea. I must admit I am awfully tired.... Hadn't I better lie down\r\nand put vinegar on my head? What do you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" I cried, \"ice even. You are very much upset.","You are pale\r\nand your hands are trembling. Lie down, rest, and put off telling me.\r\nI'll sit by you and wait.\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, but I insisted on his lying down. Nastasya brought a cup\r\nof vinegar. I wetted a towel and laid it on his head. Then Nastasya\r\nstood on a chair and began lighting a lamp before the ikon in the\r\ncorner. I noticed this with surprise; there had never been a lamp there\r\nbefore and now suddenly it had made its appearance.","\"I arranged for that as soon as they had gone away,\" muttered Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch, looking at me slyly. \"_Quand on a de ces choses-l√† dans sa\r\nchambre et qu'on vient vous arr√™ter_ it makes an impression and they are\r\nsure to report that they have seen it....\"\r\n\r\nWhen she had done the lamp, Nastasya stood in the doorway, leaned her\r\ncheek in her right hand, and began gazing at him with a lachrymose air.","\"_Eloignez-la_ on some excuse,\" he nodded to me from the sofa. \"I can't\r\nendure this Russian sympathy, _et puis √ßa m'emb√™te._\"\r\n\r\nBut she went away of herself. I noticed that he kept looking towards the\r\ndoor and listening for sounds in the passage.\r\n\r\n_\"Il faut √™tre pr√™t, voyez-vous,\"_ he said, looking at me significantly,\r\n_\"chaque moment..._ they may come and take one and, phew!--a man\r\ndisappears.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Heavens! who'll come? Who will take you?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Voyez-vous, mon cher,_ I asked straight out when he was going away, what\r\nwould they do to me now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better have asked them where you'd be exiled!\" I cried out in the\r\nsame indignation.\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I meant when I asked, but he went away without\r\nanswering. _Voyez-vous:_ as for linen, clothes, warm things especially,\r\nthat must be as they decide; if they tell me to take them--all right,\r\nor they might send me in a soldier's overcoat.","But I thrust thirty-five\r\nroubles\" (he suddenly dropped his voice, looking towards the door by\r\nwhich Nastasya had gone out) \"in a slit in my waistcoat pocket, here,\r\nfeel.... I believe they won't take the waistcoat off, and left seven\r\nroubles in my purse to keep up appearances, as though that were all I\r\nhave. You see, it's in small change and the coppers are on the table,\r\nso they won't guess that I've hidden the money, but will suppose that\r\nthat's all.","For God knows where I may have to sleep to-night!\"\r\n\r\nI bowed my head before such madness. It was obvious that a man could not\r\nbe arrested and searched in the way he was describing, and he must\r\nhave mixed things up. It's true it all happened in the days before our\r\npresent, more recent regulations. It is true, too, that according to his\r\nown account they had offered to follow the more regular procedure, but\r\nhe \"got the better of them\" and refused.","... Of course not long ago a\r\ngovernor might, in extreme cases.... But how could this be an extreme\r\ncase? That's what baffled me.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt they had a telegram from Petersburg,\" Stepan Trofimovitch said\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n\"A telegram? About you? Because of the works of Herzen and your poem?\r\nHave you taken leave of your senses? What is there in that to arrest you\r\nfor?\"\r\n\r\nI was positively angry. He made a grimace and was evidently\r\nmortified--not at my exclamation, but at the idea that there was no\r\nground for arrest.","\"Who can tell in our day what he may not be arrested for?\" he muttered\r\nenigmatically.\r\n\r\nA wild and nonsensical idea crossed my mind.\r\n\r\n\"Stepan Trofimovitch, tell me as a friend,\" I cried, \"as a real friend,\r\nI will not betray you: do you belong to some secret society or not?\"\r\n\r\nAnd on this, to my amazement, he was not quite certain whether he was or\r\nwas not a member of some secret society.","\"That depends, _voyez-vous._\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you mean 'it depends'?\"\r\n\r\n\"When with one's whole heart one is an adherent of progress and... who\r\ncan answer it? You may suppose you don't belong, and suddenly it turns\r\nout that you do belong to something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now is that possible? It's a case of yes or no.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Cela date de P√©tersburg_ when she and I were meaning to found a magazine\r\nthere. That's what's at the root of it.","She gave them the slip then, and\r\nthey forgot us, but now they've remembered. _Cher, cher,_ don't you know\r\nme?\" he cried hysterically. \"And they'll take us, put us in a cart, and\r\nmarch us off to Siberia forever, or forget us in prison.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he suddenly broke into bitter weeping. His tears positively\r\nstreamed. He covered his face with his red silk handkerchief and sobbed,\r\nsobbed convulsively for five minutes.","It wrung my heart. This was\r\nthe man who had been a prophet among us for twenty years, a leader,\r\na patriarch, the Kukolnik who had borne himself so loftily and\r\nmajestically before all of us, before whom we bowed down with genuine\r\nreverence, feeling proud of doing so--and all of a sudden here he was\r\nsobbing, sobbing like a naughty child waiting for the rod which the\r\nteacher is fetching for him.","I felt fearfully sorry for him. He believed\r\nin the reality of that \"cart\" as he believed that I was sitting by his\r\nside, and he expected it that morning, at once, that very minute, and\r\nall this on account of his Herzen and some poem! Such complete, absolute\r\nignorance of everyday reality was touching and somehow repulsive.\r\n\r\nAt last he left off crying, got up from the sofa and began walking about\r\nthe room again, continuing to talk to me, though he looked out of the\r\nwindow every minute and listened to every sound in the passage.","Our\r\nconversation was still disconnected. All my assurances and attempts\r\nto console him rebounded from him like peas from a wall. He scarcely\r\nlistened, but yet what he needed was that I should console him and keep\r\non talking with that object. I saw that he could not do without me now,\r\nand would not let me go for anything. I remained, and we spent more than\r\ntwo hours together. In conversation he recalled that Blum had taken with\r\nhim two manifestoes he had found.","\"Manifestoes!\" I said, foolishly frightened. \"Do you mean to say\r\nyou...\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ten were left here,\" he answered with vexation (he talked to me\r\nat one moment in a vexed and haughty tone and at the next with dreadful\r\nplaintiveness and humiliation), \"but I had disposed of eight already,\r\nand Blum only found two.\" And he suddenly flushed with indignation.\r\n\"_Vous me mettez avec ces gens-l√†!_ Do you suppose I could be working\r\nwith those scoundrels, those anonymous libellers, with my son Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch, _avec ces esprits forts de l√¢chet√©?_ Oh, heavens!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! haven't they mixed you up perhaps?.",".. But it's nonsense, it can't\r\nbe so,\" I observed.\r\n\r\n_\"Savez-vous,\"_ broke from him suddenly, \"I feel at moments _que je ferai\r\nl√†-bas quelque esclandre._ Oh, don't go away, don't leave me alone! _Ma\r\ncarri√®re est finie aujourd'hui, je le sens._ Do you know, I might fall on\r\nsomebody there and bite him, like that lieutenant.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with a strange expression--alarmed, and at the same time\r\nanxious to alarm me.","He certainly was getting more and more exasperated\r\nwith somebody and about something as time went on and the police-cart\r\ndid not appear; he was positively wrathful. Suddenly Nastasya, who\r\nhad come from the kitchen into the passage for some reason, upset a\r\nclothes-horse there. Stepan Trofimovitch trembled and turned numb with\r\nterror as he sat; but when the noise was explained, he almost shrieked\r\nat Nastasya and, stamping, drove her back to the kitchen.","A minute later\r\nhe said, looking at me in despair: \"I am ruined! _Cher_\"--he sat down\r\nsuddenly beside me and looked piteously into my face--\"_cher,_ it's not\r\nSiberia I am afraid of, I swear. _Oh, je vous jure!_\" (Tears positively\r\nstood in his eyes.) \"It's something else I fear.\"\r\n\r\nI saw from his expression that he wanted at last to tell me something of\r\ngreat importance which he had till now refrained from telling.","\"I am afraid of disgrace,\" he whispered mysteriously.\r\n\r\n\"What disgrace? On the contrary! Believe me, Stepan Trofimovitch, that all\r\nthis will be explained to-day and will end to your advantage....\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you so sure that they will pardon me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon you? What! What a word! What have you done? I assure you you've\r\ndone nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Qu'en savez-vous;_ all my life has been... _cher_... They'll remember\r\neverything.",".. and if they find nothing, it will be _worse still_,\" he\r\nadded all of a sudden, unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n\"How do you mean it will be worse?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend, let it be Siberia, Archangel, loss of rights--if I must\r\nperish, let me perish! But... I am afraid of something else.\" (Again\r\nwhispering, a scared face, mystery.)\r\n\r\n\"But of what? Of what?\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll flog me,\" he pronounced, looking at me with a face of despair.","\"Who'll flog you? What for? Where?\" I cried, feeling alarmed that he was\r\ngoing out of his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Where? Why there... where 'that's' done.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where is it done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh, _cher,_\" he whispered almost in my ear. \"The floor suddenly gives\r\nway under you, you drop half through.... Every one knows that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Legends!\" I cried, guessing what he meant. \"Old tales. Can you have\r\nbelieved them till now?\" I laughed.","\"Tales! But there must be foundation for them; flogged men tell no\r\ntales. I've imagined it ten thousand times.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you, why you? You've done nothing, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"That makes it worse. They'll find out I've done nothing and flog me for\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are sure that you'll be taken to Petersburg for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend, I've told you already that I regret nothing, _ma carri√®re est\r\nfinie.","_ From that hour when she said good-bye to me at Skvoreshniki my\r\nlife has had no value for me... but disgrace, disgrace, _que dira-t-elle_\r\nif she finds out?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me in despair. And the poor fellow flushed all over. I\r\ndropped my eyes too.\r\n\r\n\"She'll find out nothing, for nothing will happen to you. I feel as if I\r\nwere speaking to you for the first time in my life, Stepan Trofimovitch,\r\nyou've astonished me so this morning.","\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my friend, this isn't fear. For even if I am pardoned, even if\r\nI am brought here and nothing is done to me--then I am undone. _Elle me\r\nsoup√ßonnera toute sa vie_--me, me, the poet, the thinker, the man whom\r\nshe has worshipped for twenty-two years!\"\r\n\r\n\"It will never enter her head.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will,\" he whispered with profound conviction. \"We've talked of it\r\nseveral times in Petersburg, in Lent, before we came away, when we\r\nwere both afraid.","... _Elle me soup√ßonnera toute sa vie..._ and how can\r\nI disabuse her? It won't sound likely. And in this wretched town who'd\r\nbelieve it, _c'est invraisemblable.... Et puis les femmes,_ she will be\r\npleased. She will be genuinely grieved like a true friend, but secretly\r\nshe will be pleased.... I shall give her a weapon against me for the\r\nrest of my life. Oh, it's all over with me! Twenty years of such perfect\r\nhappiness with her.",".. and now!\" He hid his face in his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Stepan Trofimovitch, oughtn't you to let Varvara Petrovna know at once\r\nof what has happened?\" I suggested.\r\n\r\n\"God preserve me!\" he cried, shuddering and leaping up from his\r\nplace. \"On no account, never, after what was said at parting at\r\nSkvoreshniki--never!\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes flashed.\r\n\r\nWe went on sitting together another hour or more, I believe, expecting\r\nsomething all the time--the idea had taken such hold of us.","He lay down\r\nagain, even closed his eyes, and lay for twenty minutes without uttering\r\na word, so that I thought he was asleep or unconscious. Suddenly he got\r\nup impulsively, pulled the towel off his head, jumped up from the sofa,\r\nrushed to the looking-glass, with trembling hands tied his cravat, and\r\nin a voice of thunder called to Nastasya, telling her to give him his\r\novercoat, his new hat and his stick.","\"I can bear no more,\" he said in a breaking voice. \"I can't, I can't! I\r\nam going myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" I cried, jumping up too.\r\n\r\n\"To Lembke. _Cher,_ I ought, I am obliged. It's my duty. I am a citizen\r\nand a man, not a worthless chip. I have rights; I want my rights....\r\nFor twenty years I've not insisted on my rights. All my life I've\r\nneglected them criminally... but now I'll demand them. He must tell me\r\neverything--everything.","He received a telegram. He dare not torture me;\r\nif so, let him arrest me, let him arrest me!\"\r\n\r\nHe stamped and vociferated almost with shrieks. \"I approve of what you\r\nsay,\" I said, speaking as calmly as possible, on purpose, though I was\r\nvery much afraid for him.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly it is better than sitting here in such misery, but I can't\r\napprove of your state of mind. Just see what you look like and in what a\r\nstate you are going there! _Il faut √™tre digne et calme avec Lembke.","_ You\r\nreally might rush at someone there and bite him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am giving myself up. I am walking straight into the jaws of the lion....\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expected no less of you, I accept your sacrifice, the sacrifice of a\r\ntrue friend; but only as far as the house, only as far as the house. You\r\nought not, you have no right to compromise yourself further by being my\r\nconfederate. _Oh, croyez-moi, je serai calme.","_ I feel that I am at this\r\nmoment _√† la hauteur de tout ce que il y a de plus sacr√©...._\"\r\n\r\n\"I may perhaps go into the house with you,\" I interrupted him. \"I had a\r\nmessage from their stupid committee yesterday through Vysotsky that they\r\nreckon on me and invite me to the _f√™te_ to-morrow as one of the stewards\r\nor whatever it is... one of the six young men whose duty it is to look\r\nafter the trays, wait on the ladies, take the guests to their places,\r\nand wear a rosette of crimson and white ribbon on the left shoulder.","I\r\nmeant to refuse, but now why shouldn't I go into the house on the\r\nexcuse of seeing Yulia Mihailovna herself about it?... So we will go\r\nin together.\"\r\n\r\nHe listened, nodding, but I think he understood nothing. We stood on the\r\nthreshold.\r\n\r\n_\"Cher\"_--he stretched out his arm to the lamp before the ikon--\"_cher,_\r\nI have never believed in this, but... so be it, so be it!\" He crossed\r\nhimself. _\"Allons!\"_\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's better so,\" I thought as I went out on to the steps with\r\nhim.","\"The fresh air will do him good on the way, and we shall calm down,\r\nturn back, and go home to bed....\"\r\n\r\nBut I reckoned without my host. On the way an adventure occurred which\r\nagitated Stepan Trofimovitch even more, and finally determined him to go\r\non... so that I should never have expected of our friend so much spirit\r\nas he suddenly displayed that morning. Poor friend, kind-hearted friend!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.","FILIBUSTERS. A FATAL MORNING\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe adventure that befell us on the way was also a surprising one. But I\r\nmust tell the story in due order. An hour before Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nand I came out into the street, a crowd of people, the hands from\r\nShpigulins' factory, seventy or more in number, had been marching\r\nthrough the town, and had been an object of curiosity to many\r\nspectators. They walked intentionally in good order and almost in\r\nsilence.","Afterwards it was asserted that these seventy had been elected\r\nout of the whole number of factory hands, amounting to about nine\r\nhundred, to go to the governor and to try and get from him, in the\r\nabsence of their employer, a just settlement of their grievances against\r\nthe manager, who, in closing the factory and dismissing the workmen, had\r\ncheated them all in an impudent way--a fact which has since been proved\r\nconclusively.","Some people still deny that there was any election of\r\ndelegates, maintaining that seventy was too large a number to elect,\r\nand that the crowd simply consisted of those who had been most unfairly\r\ntreated, and that they only came to ask for help in their own case, so\r\nthat the general \"mutiny\" of the factory workers, about which there\r\nwas such an uproar later on, had never existed at all. Others fiercely\r\nmaintained that these seventy men were not simple strikers but\r\nrevolutionists, that is, not merely that they were the most turbulent,\r\nbut that they must have been worked upon by seditious manifestoes.","The fact is, it is still uncertain whether there had been any outside\r\ninfluence or incitement at work or not. My private opinion is that the\r\nworkmen had not read the seditious manifestoes at all, and if they had\r\nread them, would not have understood one word, for one reason because\r\nthe authors of such literature write very obscurely in spite of the\r\nboldness of their style. But as the workmen really were in a difficult\r\nplight and the police to whom they appealed would not enter into their\r\ngrievances, what could be more natural than their idea of going in a\r\nbody to \"the general himself\" if possible, with the petition at their\r\nhead, forming up in an orderly way before his door, and as soon as he\r\nshowed himself, all falling on their knees and crying out to him as to\r\nprovidence itself? To my mind there is no need to see in this a mutiny\r\nor even a deputation, for it's a traditional, historical mode of\r\naction; the Russian people have always loved to parley with \"the general\r\nhimself\" for the mere satisfaction of doing so, regardless of how the\r\nconversation may end.","And so I am quite convinced that, even though Pyotr Stepanovitch,\r\nLiputin, and perhaps some others--perhaps even Fedka too--had been\r\nflitting about among the workpeople talking to them (and there is fairly\r\ngood evidence of this), they had only approached two, three, five at the\r\nmost, trying to sound them, and nothing had come of their conversation.\r\nAs for the mutiny they advocated, if the factory-workers did understand\r\nanything of their propaganda, they would have left off listening to it\r\nat once as to something stupid that had nothing to do with them.","Fedka\r\nwas a different matter: he had more success, I believe, than Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch. Two workmen are now known for a fact to have assisted\r\nFedka in causing the fire in the town which occurred three days\r\nafterwards, and a month later three men who had worked in the factory\r\nwere arrested for robbery and arson in the province. But if in these\r\ncases Fedka did lure them to direct and immediate action, he could only\r\nhave succeeded with these five, for we heard of nothing of the sort\r\nbeing done by others.","Be that as it may, the whole crowd of workpeople had at last reached the\r\nopen space in front of the governor's house and were drawn up there in\r\nsilence and good order. Then, gaping open-mouthed at the front door,\r\nthey waited. I am told that as soon as they halted they took off their\r\ncaps, that is, a good half-hour before the appearance of the governor,\r\nwho, as ill-luck would have it, was not at home at the moment.","The\r\npolice made their appearance at once, at first individual policemen and\r\nthen as large a contingent of them as could be gathered together; they\r\nbegan, of course, by being menacing, ordering them to break up. But\r\nthe workmen remained obstinately, like a flock of sheep at a fence, and\r\nreplied laconically that they had come to see \"the general himself\"; it\r\nwas evident that they were firmly determined.","The unnatural shouting\r\nof the police ceased, and was quickly succeeded by deliberations,\r\nmysterious whispered instructions, and stern, fussy perplexity, which\r\nwrinkled the brows of the police officers. The head of the police\r\npreferred to await the arrival of the \"governor himself.\" It was not\r\ntrue that he galloped to the spot with three horses at full speed, and\r\nbegan hitting out right and left before he alighted from his carriage.","It's true that he used to dash about and was fond of dashing about at\r\nfull speed in a carriage with a yellow back, and while his trace-horses,\r\nwho were so trained to carry their heads that they looked \"positively\r\nperverted,\" galloped more and more frantically, rousing the enthusiasm\r\nof all the shopkeepers in the bazaar, he would rise up in the carriage,\r\nstand erect, holding on by a strap which had been fixed on purpose at\r\nthe side, and with his right arm extended into space like a figure on a\r\nmonument, survey the town majestically.","But in the present case he did\r\nnot use his fists, and though as he got out of the carriage he could not\r\nrefrain from a forcible expression, this was simply done to keep up\r\nhis popularity. There is a still more absurd story that soldiers were\r\nbrought up with bayonets, and that a telegram was sent for artillery and\r\nCossacks; those are legends which are not believed now even by those\r\nwho invented them.","It's an absurd story, too, that barrels of water were\r\nbrought from the fire brigade, and that people were drenched with water\r\nfrom them. The simple fact is that Ilya Ilyitch shouted in his heat that\r\nhe wouldn't let one of them come dry out of the water; probably this was\r\nthe foundation of the barrel legend which got into the columns of the\r\nPetersburg and Moscow newspapers. Probably the most accurate version was\r\nthat at first all the available police formed a cordon round the crowd,\r\nand a messenger was sent for Lembke, a police superintendent, who dashed\r\noff in the carriage belonging to the head of the police on the way to\r\nSkvoreshniki, knowing that Lembke had gone there in his carriage half an\r\nhour before.","But I must confess that I am still unable to answer the question how\r\nthey could at first sight, from the first moment, have transformed an\r\ninsignificant, that is to say an ordinary, crowd of petitioners, even\r\nthough there were several of them, into a rebellion which threatened to\r\nshake the foundations of the state. Why did Lembke himself rush at that\r\nidea when he arrived twenty minutes after the messenger? I imagine (but\r\nagain it's only my private opinion) that it was to the interest of Ilya\r\nIlyitch, who was a crony of the factory manager's, to represent the\r\ncrowd in this light to Lembke, in order to prevent him from going into\r\nthe case; and Lembke himself had put the idea into his head.","In the\r\ncourse of the last two days, he had had two unusual and mysterious\r\nconversations with him. It is true they were exceedingly obscure,\r\nbut Ilya Ilyitch was able to gather from them that the governor had\r\nthoroughly made up his mind that there were political manifestoes, and\r\nthat Shpigulins' factory hands were being incited to a Socialist rising,\r\nand that he was so persuaded of it that he would perhaps have regretted\r\nit if the story had turned out to be nonsense.","\"He wants to get\r\ndistinction in Petersburg,\" our wily Ilya Ilyitch thought to himself as\r\nhe left Von Lembke; \"well, that just suits me.\"\r\n\r\nBut I am convinced that poor Andrey Antonovitch would not have desired\r\na rebellion even for the sake of distinguishing himself. He was a most\r\nconscientious official, who had lived in a state of innocence up to the\r\ntime of his marriage. And was it his fault that, instead of an innocent\r\nallowance of wood from the government and an equally innocent Minnchen,\r\na princess of forty summers had raised him to her level? I know almost\r\nfor certain that the unmistakable symptoms of the mental condition\r\nwhich brought poor Andrey Antonovitch to a well-known establishment in\r\nSwitzerland, where, I am told, he is now regaining his energies,\r\nwere first apparent on that fatal morning.","But once we admit that\r\nunmistakable signs of something were visible that morning, it may well\r\nbe allowed that similar symptoms may have been evident the day before,\r\nthough not so clearly. I happen to know from the most private sources\r\n(well, you may assume that Yulia Mihailovna later on, not in triumph\r\nbut _almost_ in remorse--for a woman is incapable of _complete_\r\nremorse--revealed part of it to me herself) that Andrey Antonovitch had\r\ngone into his wife's room in the middle of the previous night, past\r\ntwo o'clock in the morning, had waked her up, and had insisted on her\r\nlistening to his \"ultimatum.","\" He demanded it so insistently that she\r\nwas obliged to get up from her bed in indignation and curl-papers,\r\nand, sitting down on a couch, she had to listen, though with sarcastic\r\ndisdain. Only then she grasped for the first time how far gone her\r\nAndrey Antonovitch was, and was secretly horrified. She ought to have\r\nthought what she was about and have been softened, but she concealed her\r\nhorror and was more obstinate than ever.","Like every wife she had her\r\nown method of treating Andrey Antonovitch, which she had tried more than\r\nonce already and with it driven him to frenzy. Yulia Mihailovna's method\r\nwas that of contemptuous silence, for one hour, two, a whole day and\r\nalmost for three days and nights--silence whatever happened, whatever he\r\nsaid, whatever he did, even if he had clambered up to throw himself\r\nout of a three-story window--a method unendurable for a sensitive man!\r\nWhether Yulia Mihailovna meant to punish her husband for his blunders of\r\nthe last few days and the jealous envy he, as the chief authority in the\r\ntown, felt for her administrative abilities; whether she was indignant\r\nat his criticism of her behaviour with the young people and local\r\nsociety generally, and lack of comprehension of her subtle and\r\nfar-sighted political aims; or was angry with his stupid and senseless\r\njealousy of Pyotr Stepanovitch--however that may have been, she made\r\nup her mind not to be softened even now, in spite of its being three\r\no'clock at night, and though Andrey Antonovitch was in a state of\r\nemotion such as she had never seen him in before.","Pacing up and down in all directions over the rugs of her boudoir,\r\nbeside himself, he poured out everything, everything, quite\r\ndisconnectedly, it's true, but everything that had been rankling in\r\nhis heart, for--\"it was outrageous.\" He began by saying that he was a\r\nlaughing-stock to every one and \"was being led by the nose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Curse the expression,\" he squealed, at once catching her smile, \"let it\r\nstand, it's true.","... No, madam, the time has come; let me tell you it's\r\nnot a time for laughter and feminine arts now. We are not in the boudoir\r\nof a mincing lady, but like two abstract creatures in a balloon who have\r\nmet to speak the truth.\" (He was no doubt confused and could not find\r\nthe right words for his ideas, however just they were.) \"It is you,\r\nmadam, you who have destroyed my happy past. I took up this post\r\nsimply for your sake, for the sake of your ambition.","... You smile\r\nsarcastically? Don't triumph, don't be in a hurry. Let me tell you,\r\nmadam, let me tell you that I should have been equal to this position,\r\nand not only this position but a dozen positions like it, for I have\r\nabilities; but with you, madam, with you--it's impossible, for with\r\nyou here I have no abilities. There cannot be two centres, and you have\r\ncreated two--one of mine and one in your boudoir--two centres of power,\r\nmadam, but I won't allow it, I won't allow it! In the service, as in\r\nmarriage, there must be one centre, two are impossible.","... How have you\r\nrepaid me?\" he went on. \"Our marriage has been nothing but your proving\r\nto me all the time, every hour, that I am a nonentity, a fool, and\r\neven a rascal, and I have been all the time, every hour, forced in a\r\ndegrading way to prove to you that I am not a nonentity, not a fool at\r\nall, and that I impress every one with my honourable character. Isn't\r\nthat degrading for both sides?\"\r\n\r\nAt this point he began rapidly stamping with both feet on the carpet,\r\nso that Yulia Mihailovna was obliged to get up with stern dignity.","He\r\nsubsided quickly, but passed to being pathetic and began sobbing (yes,\r\nsobbing!), beating himself on the breast almost for five minutes,\r\ngetting more and more frantic at Yulia Mihailovna's profound silence. At\r\nlast he made a fatal blunder, and let slip that he was jealous of Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch. Realising that he had made an utter fool of himself, he\r\nbecame savagely furious, and shouted that he \"would not allow them to\r\ndeny God\" and that he would \"send her _salon_ of irresponsible infidels\r\npacking,\" that the governor of a province was bound to believe in God\r\n\"and so his wife was too,\" that he wouldn't put up with these young\r\nmen; that \"you, madam, for the sake of your own dignity, ought to have\r\nthought of your husband and to have stood up for his intelligence even\r\nif he were a man of poor abilities (and I'm by no means a man of poor\r\nabilities!), and yet it's your doing that every one here despises me, it\r\nwas you put them all up to it!\" He shouted that he would annihilate\r\nthe woman question, that he would eradicate every trace of it, that\r\nto-morrow he would forbid and break up their silly f√™te for the benefit\r\nof the governesses (damn them!), that the first governess he came across\r\nto-morrow morning he would drive out of the province \"with a Cossack!\r\nI'll make a point of it!\" he shrieked.","\"Do you know,\" he screamed, \"do\r\nyou know that your rascals are inciting men at the factory, and that I\r\nknow it? Let me tell you, I know the names of four of these rascals and\r\nthat I am going out of my mind, hopelessly, hopelessly!...\"\r\n\r\nBut at this point Yulia Mihailovna suddenly broke her silence and\r\nsternly announced that she had long been aware of these criminal\r\ndesigns, and that it was all foolishness, and that he had taken it too\r\nseriously, and that as for these mischievous fellows, she knew not only\r\nthose four but all of them (it was a lie); but that she had not the\r\nfaintest intention of going out of her mind on account of it, but, on\r\nthe contrary, had all the more confidence in her intelligence and hoped\r\nto bring it all to a harmonious conclusion: to encourage the young\r\npeople, to bring them to reason, to show them suddenly and unexpectedly\r\nthat their designs were known, and then to point out to them new aims\r\nfor rational and more noble activity.","Oh, how can I describe the effect of this on Andrey Antonovitch! Hearing\r\nthat Pyotr Stepanovitch had duped him again and had made a fool of him\r\nso coarsely, that he had told her much more than he had told him, and\r\nsooner than him, and that perhaps Pyotr Stepanovitch was the chief\r\ninstigator of all these criminal designs--he flew into a frenzy.\r\n\"Senseless but malignant woman,\" he cried, snapping his bonds at one\r\nblow, \"let me tell you, I shall arrest your worthless lover at once, I\r\nshall put him in fetters and send him to the fortress, or--I shall jump\r\nout of a window before your eyes this minute!\"\r\n\r\nYulia Mihailovna, turning green with anger, greeted this tirade at once\r\nwith a burst of prolonged, ringing laughter, going off into peals such\r\nas one hears at the French theatre when a Parisian actress, imported for\r\na fee of a hundred thousand to play a coquette, laughs in her husband's\r\nface for daring to be jealous of her.","Von Lembke rushed to the window, but suddenly stopped as though rooted\r\nto the spot, folded his arms across his chest, and, white as a corpse,\r\nlooked with a sinister gaze at the laughing lady. \"Do you know, Yulia,\r\ndo you know,\" he said in a gasping and suppliant voice, \"do you know\r\nthat even I can do something?\" But at the renewed and even louder\r\nlaughter that followed his last words he clenched his teeth, groaned,\r\nand suddenly rushed, not towards the window, but at his spouse, with his\r\nfist raised! He did not bring it down--no, I repeat again and again, no;\r\nbut it was the last straw.","He ran to his own room, not knowing what he\r\nwas doing, flung himself, dressed as he was, face downwards on his bed,\r\nwrapped himself convulsively, head and all, in the sheet, and lay so for\r\ntwo hours--incapable of sleep, incapable of thought, with a load on his\r\nheart and blank, immovable despair in his soul. Now and then he shivered\r\nall over with an agonising, feverish tremor. Disconnected and irrelevant\r\nthings kept coming into his mind: at one minute he thought of the old\r\nclock which used to hang on his wall fifteen years ago in Petersburg and\r\nhad lost the minute-hand; at another of the cheerful clerk, Millebois,\r\nand how they had once caught a sparrow together in Alexandrovsky\r\nPark and had laughed so that they could be heard all over the park,\r\nremembering that one of them was already a college assessor.","I imagine\r\nthat about seven in the morning he must have fallen asleep without being\r\naware of it himself, and must have slept with enjoyment, with agreeable\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nWaking about ten o'clock, he jumped wildly out of bed remembered\r\neverything at once, and slapped himself on the head; he refused his\r\nbreakfast, and would see neither Blum nor the chief of the police nor\r\nthe clerk who came to remind him that he was expected to preside over\r\na meeting that morning; he would listen to nothing, and did not want to\r\nunderstand.","He ran like one possessed to Yulia Mihailovna's part of the\r\nhouse. There Sofya Antropovna, an old lady of good family who had lived\r\nfor years with Yulia Mihailovna, explained to him that his wife had set\r\noff at ten o'clock that morning with a large company in three carriages\r\nto Varvara Petrovna Stavrogin's, to Skvoreshniki, to look over the place\r\nwith a view to the second f√™te which was planned for a fortnight later,\r\nand that the visit to-day had been arranged with Varvara Petrovna three\r\ndays before.","Overwhelmed with this news, Andrey Antonovitch returned to\r\nhis study and impulsively ordered the horses. He could hardly wait for\r\nthem to be got ready. His soul was hungering for Yulia Mihailovna--to\r\nlook at her, to be near her for five minutes; perhaps she would glance\r\nat him, notice him, would smile as before, forgive him... \"O-oh! Aren't\r\nthe horses ready?\" Mechanically he opened a thick book lying on the\r\ntable.","(He sometimes used to try his fortune in this way with a book,\r\nopening it at random and reading the three lines at the top of the\r\nright-hand page.) What turned up was: _\"Tout est pour le mieux dans\r\nle meilleur des mondes possibles.\"_--Voltaire, _Candide._ He uttered\r\nan ejaculation of contempt and ran to get into the carriage.\r\n\"Skvoreshniki!\"\r\n\r\nThe coachman said afterwards that his master urged him on all the way,\r\nbut as soon as they were getting near the mansion he suddenly told him\r\nto turn and drive back to the town, bidding him \"Drive fast; please\r\ndrive fast!\" Before they reached the town wall \"master told me to stop\r\nagain, got out of the carriage, and went across the road into the field;\r\nI thought he felt ill but he stopped and began looking at the flowers,\r\nand so he stood for a time.","It was strange, really; I began to feel\r\nquite uneasy.\" This was the coachman's testimony. I remember the weather\r\nthat morning: it was a cold, clear, but windy September day; before\r\nAndrey Antonovitch stretched a forbidding landscape of bare fields from\r\nwhich the crop had long been harvested; there were a few dying yellow\r\nflowers, pitiful relics blown about by the howling wind. Did he want to\r\ncompare himself and his fate with those wretched flowers battered by the\r\nautumn and the frost? I don't think so; in fact I feel sure it was\r\nnot so, and that he realised nothing about the flowers in spite of the\r\nevidence of the coachman and of the police superintendent, who drove up\r\nat that moment and asserted afterwards that he found the governor with\r\na bunch of yellow flowers in his hand.","This police superintendent,\r\nFlibusterov by name, was an ardent champion of authority who had only\r\nrecently come to our town but had already distinguished himself and\r\nbecome famous by his inordinate zeal, by a certain vehemence in the\r\nexecution of his duties, and his inveterate inebriety. Jumping out of\r\nthe carriage, and not the least disconcerted at the sight of what the\r\ngovernor was doing, he blurted out all in one breath, with a frantic\r\nexpression, yet with an air of conviction, that \"There's an upset in the\r\ntown.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh? What?\" said Andrey Antonovitch, turning to him with a stern face,\r\nbut without a trace of surprise or any recollection of his carriage and\r\nhis coachman, as though he had been in his own study.\r\n\r\n\"Police-superintendent Flibusterov, your Excellency. There's a riot in\r\nthe town.\"\r\n\r\n\"Filibusters?\" Andrey Antonovitch said thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Just so, your Excellency. The Shpigulin men are making a riot.","\"\r\n\r\n\"The Shpigulin men!...\"\r\n\r\nThe name \"Shpigulin\" seemed to remind him of something. He started and\r\nput his finger to his forehead: \"The Shpigulin men!\" In silence, and\r\nstill plunged in thought, he walked without haste to the carriage,\r\ntook his seat, and told the coachman to drive to the town. The\r\npolice-superintendent followed in the droshky.\r\n\r\nI imagine that he had vague impressions of many interesting things of\r\nall sorts on the way, but I doubt whether he had any definite idea or\r\nany settled intention as he drove into the open space in front of his\r\nhouse.","But no sooner did he see the resolute and orderly ranks of \"the\r\nrioters,\" the cordon of police, the helpless (and perhaps purposely\r\nhelpless) chief of police, and the general expectation of which he was\r\nthe object, than all the blood rushed to his heart. With a pale face he\r\nstepped out of his carriage.\r\n\r\n\"Caps off!\" he said breathlessly and hardly audibly. \"On your knees!\"\r\nhe squealed, to the surprise of every one, to his own surprise too, and\r\nperhaps the very unexpectedness of the position was the explanation of\r\nwhat followed.","Can a sledge on a switchback at carnival stop short as it\r\nflies down the hill? What made it worse, Andrey Antonovitch had been all\r\nhis life serene in character, and never shouted or stamped at anyone;\r\nand such people are always the most dangerous if it once happens that\r\nsomething sets their sledge sliding downhill. Everything was whirling\r\nbefore his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Filibusters!\" he yelled still more shrilly and absurdly, and his voice\r\nbroke.","He stood, not knowing what he was going to do, but knowing\r\nand feeling in his whole being that he certainly would do something\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\n\"Lord!\" was heard from the crowd. A lad began crossing himself; three or\r\nfour men actually did try to kneel down, but the whole mass moved three\r\nsteps forward, and suddenly all began talking at once: \"Your\r\nExcellency... we were hired for a term... the manager.",".. you mustn't\r\nsay,\" and so on and so on. It was impossible to distinguish anything.\r\n\r\nAlas! Andrey Antonovitch could distinguish nothing: the flowers were\r\nstill in his hands. The riot was as real to him as the prison carts\r\nwere to Stepan Trofimovitch. And flitting to and fro in the crowd\r\nof \"rioters\" who gazed open-eyed at him, he seemed to see Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch, who had egged them on--Pyotr Stepanovitch, whom he hated\r\nand whose image had never left him since yesterday.","\"Rods!\" he cried even more unexpectedly. A dead silence followed.\r\n\r\nFrom the facts I have learnt and those I have conjectured, this must\r\nhave been what happened at the beginning; but I have no such exact\r\ninformation for what followed, nor can I conjecture it so easily. There\r\nare some facts, however.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, rods were brought on the scene with strange\r\nrapidity; they had evidently been got ready beforehand in expectation\r\nby the intelligent chief of the police.","Not more than two, or at most\r\nthree, were actually flogged, however; that fact I wish to lay stress\r\non. It's an absolute fabrication to say that the whole crowd of rioters,\r\nor at least half of them, were punished. It is a nonsensical story,\r\ntoo, that a poor but respectable lady was caught as she passed by\r\nand promptly thrashed; yet I read myself an account of this incident\r\nafterwards among the provincial items of a Petersburg newspaper.","Many\r\npeople in the town talked of an old woman called Avdotya Petrovna\r\nTarapygin who lived in the almshouse by the cemetery. She was said,\r\non her way home from visiting a friend, to have forced her way into the\r\ncrowd of spectators through natural curiosity. Seeing what was going on,\r\nshe cried out, \"What a shame!\" and spat on the ground. For this it was\r\nsaid she had been seized and flogged too.","This story not only appeared\r\nin print, but in our excitement we positively got up a subscription for\r\nher benefit. I subscribed twenty kopecks myself. And would you believe\r\nit? It appears now that there was no old woman called Tarapygin living\r\nin the almshouse at all! I went to inquire at the almshouse by the\r\ncemetery myself; they had never heard of anyone called Tarapygin there,\r\nand, what's more, they were quite offended when I told them the story\r\nthat was going round.","I mention this fabulous Avdotya Petrovna because\r\nwhat happened to her (if she really had existed) very nearly happened\r\nto Stepan Trofimovitch. Possibly, indeed, his adventure may have been at\r\nthe bottom of the ridiculous tale about the old woman, that is, as the\r\ngossip went on growing he was transformed into this old dame.\r\n\r\nWhat I find most difficult to understand is how he came to slip away\r\nfrom me as soon as he got into the square.","As I had a misgiving of\r\nsomething very unpleasant, I wanted to take him round the square\r\nstraight to the entrance to the governor's, but my own curiosity was\r\nroused, and I stopped only for one minute to question the first person\r\nI came across, and suddenly I looked round and found Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nno longer at my side. Instinctively I darted off to look for him in the\r\nmost dangerous place; something made me feel that his sledge, too, was\r\nflying downhill.","And I did, as a fact, find him in the very centre of\r\nthings. I remember I seized him by the arm; but he looked quietly and\r\nproudly at me with an air of immense authority.\r\n\r\n_\"Cher,\"_ he pronounced in a voice which quivered on a breaking note, \"if\r\nthey are dealing with people so unceremoniously before us, in an open\r\nsquare, what is to be expected from that man, for instance... if he\r\nhappens to act on his own authority?\"\r\n\r\nAnd shaking with indignation and with an intense desire to defy them, he\r\npointed a menacing, accusing finger at Flibusterov, who was gazing at us\r\nopen-eyed two paces away.","\"That man!\" cried the latter, blind with rage. \"What man? And who are\r\nyou?\" He stepped up to him, clenching his fist. \"Who are you?\" he roared\r\nferociously, hysterically, and desperately. (I must mention that he\r\nknew Stepan Trofimovitch perfectly well by sight.) Another moment and he\r\nwould have certainly seized him by the collar; but luckily, hearing him\r\nshout, Lembke turned his head. He gazed intensely but with perplexity\r\nat Stepan Trofimovitch, seeming to consider something, and suddenly\r\nhe shook his hand impatiently.","Flibusterov was checked. I drew Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch out of the crowd, though perhaps he may have wished to\r\nretreat himself.\r\n\r\n\"Home, home,\" I insisted; \"it was certainly thanks to Lembke that we\r\nwere not beaten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, my friend; I am to blame for exposing you to this. You have\r\na future and a career of a sort before you, while I--_mon heure est\r\nsonn√©e._\"\r\n\r\nHe resolutely mounted the governor's steps.","The hall-porter knew me; I\r\nsaid that we both wanted to see Yulia Mihailovna.\r\n\r\nWe sat down in the waiting-room and waited. I was unwilling to leave my\r\nfriend, but I thought it unnecessary to say anything more to him. He had\r\nthe air of a man who had consecrated himself to certain death for the\r\nsake of his country. We sat down, not side by side, but in different\r\ncorners--I nearer to the entrance, he at some distance facing me, with\r\nhis head bent in thought, leaning lightly on his stick.","He held his\r\nwide-brimmed hat in his left hand. We sat like that for ten minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nLembke suddenly came in with rapid steps, accompanied by the chief of\r\npolice, looked absent-mindedly at us and, taking no notice of us, was\r\nabout to pass into his study on the right, but Stepan Trofimovitch stood\r\nbefore him blocking his way. The tall figure of Stepan Trofimovitch, so\r\nunlike other people, made an impression.","Lembke stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Who is this?\" he muttered, puzzled, as if he were questioning the chief\r\nof police, though he did not turn his head towards him, and was all the\r\ntime gazing at Stepan Trofimovitch.\r\n\r\n\"Retired college assessor, Stepan Trofimovitch Verhovensky, your\r\nExcellency,\" answered Stepan Trofimovitch, bowing majestically. His\r\nExcellency went on staring at him with a very blank expression, however.","\"What is it?\" And with the curtness of a great official he turned his\r\near to Stepan Trofimovitch with disdainful impatience, taking him for an\r\nordinary person with a written petition of some sort.\r\n\r\n\"I was visited and my house was searched to-day by an official acting in\r\nyour Excellency's name; therefore I am desirous...\"\r\n\r\n\"Name? Name?\" Lembke asked impatiently, seeming suddenly to have an\r\ninkling of something.","Stepan Trofimovitch repeated his name still more\r\nmajestically.\r\n\r\n\"A-a-ah! It's... that hotbed... You have shown yourself, sir, in such a\r\nlight.... Are you a professor? a professor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I once had the honour of giving some lectures to the young men of the X\r\nuniversity.\"\r\n\r\n\"The young men!\" Lembke seemed to start, though I am ready to bet that\r\nhe grasped very little of what was going on or even, perhaps, did not\r\nknow with whom he was talking.","\"That, sir, I won't allow,\" he cried, suddenly getting terribly angry.\r\n\"I won't allow young men! It's all these manifestoes? It's an assault\r\non society, sir, a piratical attack, filibustering.... What is your\r\nrequest?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, your wife requested me to read something to-morrow at\r\nher f√™te. I've not come to make a request but to ask for my rights....\"\r\n\r\n\"At the f√™te? There'll be no f√™te.","I won't allow your f√™te. A lecture? A\r\nlecture?\" he screamed furiously.\r\n\r\n\"I should be very glad if you would speak to me rather more politely,\r\nyour Excellency, without stamping or shouting at me as though I were a\r\nboy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you understand whom you are speaking to?\" said Lembke, turning\r\ncrimson.\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly, your Excellency.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am protecting society while you are destroying it!..",". You... I\r\nremember about you, though: you used to be a tutor in the house of\r\nMadame Stavrogin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I was in the position... of tutor... in the house of Madame\r\nStavrogin.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have been for twenty years the hotbed of all that has now\r\naccumulated... all the fruits.... I believe I saw you just now in the\r\nsquare. You'd better look out, sir, you'd better look out; your way of\r\nthinking is well known.","You may be sure that I keep my eye on you. I\r\ncannot allow your lectures, sir, I cannot. Don't come with such requests\r\nto me.\"\r\n\r\nHe would have passed on again.\r\n\r\n\"I repeat that your Excellency is mistaken; it was your wife who asked\r\nme to give, not a lecture, but a literary reading at the f√™te to-morrow.\r\nBut I decline to do so in any case now. I humbly request that you will\r\nexplain to me if possible how, why, and for what reason I was subjected\r\nto an official search to-day? Some of my books and papers, private\r\nletters to me, were taken from me and wheeled through the town in a\r\nbarrow.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Who searched you?\" said Lembke, starting and returning to full\r\nconsciousness of the position. He suddenly flushed all over. He turned\r\nquickly to the chief of police. At that moment the long, stooping, and\r\nawkward figure of Blum appeared in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"Why, this official here,\" said Stepan Trofimovitch, indicating him. Blum\r\ncame forward with a face that admitted his responsibility but showed no\r\ncontrition.","_\"Vous ne faites que des b√™tises,\"_ Lembke threw at him in a tone of\r\nvexation and anger, and suddenly he was transformed and completely\r\nhimself again.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me,\" he muttered, utterly disconcerted and turning absolutely\r\ncrimson, \"all this... all this was probably a mere blunder, a\r\nmisunderstanding... nothing but a misunderstanding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Excellency,\" observed Stepan Trofimovitch, \"once when I was young\r\nI saw a characteristic incident.","In the corridor of a theatre a man ran\r\nup to another and gave him a sounding smack in the face before the whole\r\npublic. Perceiving at once that his victim was not the person whom he\r\nhad intended to chastise but someone quite different who only slightly\r\nresembled him, he pronounced angrily, with the haste of one whose\r\nmoments are precious--as your Excellency did just now--'I've made\r\na mistake.",".. excuse me, it was a misunderstanding, nothing but a\r\nmisunderstanding.' And when the offended man remained resentful and\r\ncried out, he observed to him, with extreme annoyance: 'Why, I tell you\r\nit was a misunderstanding. What are you crying out about?'\"\r\n\r\n\"That's... that's very amusing, of course\"--Lembke gave a wry\r\nsmile--\"but... but can't you see how unhappy I am myself?\"\r\n\r\nHe almost screamed, and seemed about to hide his face in his hands.","This unexpected and piteous exclamation, almost a sob, was almost more\r\nthan one could bear. It was probably the first moment since the previous\r\nday that he had full, vivid consciousness of all that had happened--and\r\nit was followed by complete, humiliating despair that could not be\r\ndisguised--who knows, in another minute he might have sobbed aloud.\r\nFor the first moment Stepan Trofimovitch looked wildly at him; then he\r\nsuddenly bowed his head and in a voice pregnant with feeling pronounced:\r\n\r\n\"Your Excellency, don't trouble yourself with my petulant complaint, and\r\nonly give orders for my books and letters to be restored to me.","...\"\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted. At that very instant Yulia Mihailovna returned and\r\nentered noisily with all the party which had accompanied her. But at\r\nthis point I should like to tell my story in as much detail as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the whole company who had filled three carriages\r\ncrowded into the waiting-room. There was a special entrance to Yulia\r\nMihailovna's apartments on the left as one entered the house; but on\r\nthis occasion they all went through the waiting-room--and I imagine just\r\nbecause Stepan Trofimovitch was there, and because all that had happened\r\nto him as well as the Shpigulin affair had reached Yulia Mihailovna's\r\nears as she drove into the town.","Lyamshin, who for some misdemeanour\r\nhad not been invited to join the party and so knew all that had been\r\nhappening in the town before anyone else, brought her the news. With\r\nspiteful glee he hired a wretched Cossack nag and hastened on the way\r\nto Skvoreshniki to meet the returning cavalcade with the diverting\r\nintelligence. I fancy that, in spite of her lofty determination, Yulia\r\nMihailovna was a little disconcerted on hearing such surprising news,\r\nbut probably only for an instant.","The political aspect of the affair,\r\nfor instance, could not cause her uneasiness; Pyotr Stepanovitch had\r\nimpressed upon her three or four times that the Shpigulin ruffians ought\r\nto be flogged, and Pyotr Stepanovitch certainly had for some time past\r\nbeen a great authority in her eyes. \"But... anyway, I shall make him pay\r\nfor it,\" she doubtless reflected, the \"he,\" of course, referring to\r\nher spouse.","I must observe in passing that on this occasion, as though\r\npurposely, Pyotr Stepanovitch had taken no part in the expedition,\r\nand no one had seen him all day. I must mention too, by the way, that\r\nVarvara Petrovna had come back to the town with her guests (in the\r\nsame carriage with Yulia Mihailovna) in order to be present at the last\r\nmeeting of the committee which was arranging the f√™te for the next day.","She too must have been interested, and perhaps even agitated, by the\r\nnews about Stepan Trofimovitch communicated by Lyamshin.\r\n\r\nThe hour of reckoning for Andrey Antonovitch followed at once. Alas! he\r\nfelt that from the first glance at his admirable wife. With an open air\r\nand an enchanting smile she went quickly up to Stepan Trofimovitch, held\r\nout her exquisitely gloved hand, and greeted him with a perfect shower\r\nof flattering phrases--as though the only thing she cared about that\r\nmorning was to make haste to be charming to Stepan Trofimovitch because\r\nat last she saw him in her house.","There was not one hint of the search\r\nthat morning; it was as though she knew nothing of it. There was not one\r\nword to her husband, not one glance in his direction--as though he\r\nhad not been in the room. What's more, she promptly confiscated Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch and carried him off to the drawing-room--as though he had\r\nhad no interview with Lembke, or as though it was not worth prolonging\r\nif he had.","I repeat again, I think that in this, Yulia Mihailovna,\r\nin spite of her aristocratic tone, made another great mistake. And\r\nKarmazinov particularly did much to aggravate this. (He had taken part\r\nin the expedition at Yulia Mihailovna's special request, and in that way\r\nhad, incidentally, paid his visit to Varvara Petrovna, and she was so\r\npoor-spirited as to be perfectly delighted at it.) On seeing Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch, he called out from the doorway (he came in behind the\r\nrest) and pressed forward to embrace him, even interrupting Yulia\r\nMihailovna.","\"What years, what ages! At last..._excellent ami._\"\r\n\r\nHe made as though to kiss him, offering his cheek, of course, and Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch was so fluttered that he could not avoid saluting it.\r\n\r\n_\"Cher,\"_ he said to me that evening, recalling all the events of that\r\nday, \"I wondered at that moment which of us was the most contemptible:\r\nhe, embracing me only to humiliate me, or I, despising him and his face\r\nand kissing it on the spot, though I might have turned away.","... Foo!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, tell me about yourself, tell me everything,\" Karmazinov drawled\r\nand lisped, as though it were possible for him on the spur of the moment\r\nto give an account of twenty-five years of his life. But this foolish\r\ntrifling was the height of \"chic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember that the last time we met was at the Granovsky dinner in\r\nMoscow, and that twenty-four years have passed since then...\" Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch began very reasonably (and consequently not at all in the\r\nsame \"chic\" style).","_\"Ce cher homme,\"_ Karmazinov interrupted with shrill familiarity,\r\nsqueezing his shoulder with exaggerated friendliness. \"Make haste and\r\ntake us to your room, Yulia Mihailovna; there he'll sit down and tell us\r\neverything.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet I was never at all intimate with that peevish old woman,\"\r\nStepan Trofimovitch went on complaining to me that same evening, shaking\r\nwith anger; \"we were almost boys, and I'd begun to detest him even\r\nthen.",".. just as he had me, of course.\"\r\n\r\nYulia Mihailovna's drawing-room filled up quickly. Varvara Petrovna\r\nwas particularly excited, though she tried to appear indifferent, but\r\nI caught her once or twice glancing with hatred at Karmazinov and with\r\nwrath at Stepan Trofimovitch--the wrath of anticipation, the wrath of\r\njealousy and love: if Stepan Trofimovitch had blundered this time and\r\nhad let Karmazinov make him look small before every one, I believe she\r\nwould have leapt up and beaten him.","I have forgotten to say that\r\nLiza too was there, and I had never seen her more radiant, carelessly\r\nlight-hearted, and happy. Mavriky Nikolaevitch was there too, of course.\r\nIn the crowd of young ladies and rather vulgar young men who made up\r\nYulia Mihailovna's usual retinue, and among whom this vulgarity was\r\ntaken for sprightliness, and cheap cynicism for wit, I noticed two or\r\nthree new faces: a very obsequious Pole who was on a visit in the town;\r\na German doctor, a sturdy old fellow who kept loudly laughing with great\r\nzest at his own wit; and lastly, a very young princeling from Petersburg\r\nlike an automaton figure, with the deportment of a state dignitary and\r\na fearfully high collar.","But it was evident that Yulia Mihailovna had a\r\nvery high opinion of this visitor, and was even a little anxious of the\r\nimpression her salon was making on him.\r\n\r\n_\"Cher M. Karmazinov,\"_ said Stepan Trofimovitch, sitting in a picturesque\r\npose on the sofa and suddenly beginning to lisp as daintily as\r\nKarmazinov himself, \"_cher M. Karmazinov,_ the life of a man of our time\r\nand of certain convictions, even after an interval of twenty-five years,\r\nis bound to seem monotonous.","..\"\r\n\r\nThe German went off into a loud abrupt guffaw like a neigh, evidently\r\nimagining that Stepan Trofimovitch had said something exceedingly funny.\r\nThe latter gazed at him with studied amazement but produced no effect\r\non him whatever. The prince, too, looked at the German, turning head,\r\ncollar and all, towards him and putting up his pince-nez, though without\r\nthe slightest curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"... Is bound to seem monotonous,\" Stepan Trofimovitch intentionally\r\nrepeated, drawling each word as deliberately and nonchalantly as\r\npossible.","\"And so my life has been throughout this quarter of a century,\r\n_et comme on trouve partout plus de moines que de raison,_ and as I am\r\nentirely of this opinion, it has come to pass that throughout this\r\nquarter of a century I...\"\r\n\r\n_\"C'est charmant, les moines,\"_ whispered Yulia Mihailovna, turning to\r\nVarvara Petrovna, who was sitting beside her.\r\n\r\nVarvara Petrovna responded with a look of pride.","But Karmazinov could\r\nnot stomach the success of the French phrase, and quickly and shrilly\r\ninterrupted Stepan Trofimovitch.\r\n\r\n\"As for me, I am quite at rest on that score, and for the past seven\r\nyears I've been settled at Karlsruhe. And last year, when it was\r\nproposed by the town council to lay down a new water-pipe, I felt in\r\nmy heart that this question of water-pipes in Karlsruhe was dearer and\r\ncloser to my heart than all the questions of my precious Fatherland.","..\r\nin this period of so-called reform.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help sympathising, though it goes against the grain,\" sighed\r\nStepan Trofimovitch, bowing his head significantly.\r\n\r\nYulia Mihailovna was triumphant: the conversation was becoming profound\r\nand taking a political turn.\r\n\r\n\"A drain-pipe?\" the doctor inquired in a loud voice.\r\n\r\n\"A water-pipe, doctor, a water-pipe, and I positively assisted them in\r\ndrawing up the plan.","\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor went off into a deafening guffaw. Many people followed his\r\nexample, laughing in the face of the doctor, who remained unconscious of\r\nit and was highly delighted that every one was laughing.\r\n\r\n\"You must allow me to differ from you, Karmazinov,\" Yulia Mihailovna\r\nhastened to interpose. \"Karlsruhe is all very well, but you are fond\r\nof mystifying people, and this time we don't believe you.","What Russian\r\nwriter has presented so many modern types, has brought forward so many\r\ncontemporary problems, has put his finger on the most vital modern\r\npoints which make up the type of the modern man of action? You, only\r\nyou, and no one else. It's no use your assuring us of your coldness\r\ntowards your own country and your ardent interest in the water-pipes of\r\nKarlsruhe. Ha ha!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, no doubt,\" lisped Karmazinov.","\"I have portrayed in the character\r\nof Pogozhev all the failings of the Slavophils and in the character of\r\nNikodimov all the failings of the Westerners....\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, hardly _all!_\" Lyamshin whispered slyly.\r\n\r\n\"But I do this by the way, simply to while away the tedious hours and to\r\nsatisfy the persistent demands of my fellow-countrymen.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are probably aware, Stepan Trofimovitch,\" Yulia Mihailovna went on\r\nenthusiastically, \"that to-morrow we shall have the delight of hearing\r\nthe charming lines.",".. one of the last of Semyon Yakovlevitch's exquisite\r\nliterary inspirations--it's called _Merci._ He announces in this piece\r\nthat he will write no more, that nothing in the world will induce him\r\nto, if angels from Heaven or, what's more, all the best society were to\r\nimplore him to change his mind. In fact he is laying down the pen for\r\ngood, and this graceful _Merci_ is addressed to the public in grateful\r\nacknowledgment of the constant enthusiasm with which it has for so many\r\nyears greeted his unswerving loyalty to true Russian thought.","\"\r\n\r\nYulia Mihailovna was at the acme of bliss.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I shall make my farewell; I shall say my _Merci_ and depart and\r\nthere... in Karlsruhe... I shall close my eyes.\" Karmazinov was gradually\r\nbecoming maudlin.\r\n\r\nLike many of our great writers (and there are numbers of them amongst\r\nus), he could not resist praise, and began to be limp at once, in spite\r\nof his penetrating wit. But I consider this is pardonable.","They say that\r\none of our Shakespeares positively blurted out in private conversation\r\nthat \"we _great men_ can't do otherwise,\" and so on, and, what's more, was\r\nunaware of it.\r\n\r\n\"There in Karlsruhe I shall close my eyes. When we have done our duty,\r\nall that's left for us great men is to make haste to close our eyes\r\nwithout seeking a reward. I shall do so too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me the address and I shall come to Karlsruhe to visit your tomb,\"\r\nsaid the German, laughing immoderately.","\"They send corpses by rail nowadays,\" one of the less important young\r\nmen said unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nLyamshin positively shrieked with delight. Yulia Mihailovna frowned.\r\nNikolay Stavrogin walked in.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I was told that you were locked up?\" he said aloud, addressing\r\nStepan Trofimovitch before every one else.\r\n\r\n\"No, it was a case of unlocking,\" jested Stepan Trofimovitch.\r\n\r\n\"But I hope that what's happened will have no influence on what I asked\r\nyou to do,\" Yulia Mihailovna put in again.","\"I trust that you will not\r\nlet this unfortunate annoyance, of which I had no idea, lead you to\r\ndisappoint our eager expectations and deprive us of the enjoyment of\r\nhearing your reading at our literary matin√©e.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, I... now...\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, I am so unlucky, Varvara Petrovna... and only fancy, just when\r\nI was so longing to make the personal acquaintance of one of the\r\nmost remarkable and independent intellects of Russia--and here Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch suddenly talks of deserting us.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Your compliment is uttered so audibly that I ought to pretend not to\r\nhear it,\" Stepan Trofimovitch said neatly, \"but I cannot believe that\r\nmy insignificant presence is so indispensable at your f√™te to-morrow.\r\nHowever, I...\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you'll spoil him!\" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch, bursting into the\r\nroom. \"I've only just got him in hand--and in one morning he has been\r\nsearched, arrested, taken by the collar by a policeman, and here ladies\r\nare cooing to him in the governor's drawing-room.","Every bone in his body\r\nis aching with rapture; in his wildest dreams he had never hoped for\r\nsuch good fortune. Now he'll begin informing against the Socialists\r\nafter this!\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible, Pyotr Stepanovitch! Socialism is too grand an idea to\r\nbe unrecognised by Stepan Trofimovitch.\" Yulia Mihailovna took up the\r\ngauntlet with energy.\r\n\r\n\"It's a great idea but its exponents are not always great men, _et\r\nbrisons-l√†, mon cher,_\" Stepan Trofimovitch ended, addressing his son and\r\nrising gracefully from his seat.","But at this point an utterly unexpected circumstance occurred. Von\r\nLembke had been in the room for some time but seemed unnoticed by\r\nanyone, though every one had seen him come in. In accordance with her\r\nformer plan, Yulia Mihailovna went on ignoring him. He took up his\r\nposition near the door and with a stern face listened gloomily to the\r\nconversation. Hearing an allusion to the events of the morning, he\r\nbegan fidgeting uneasily, stared at the prince, obviously struck by his\r\nstiffly starched, prominent collar; then suddenly he seemed to start on\r\nhearing the voice of Pyotr Stepanovitch and seeing him burst in; and no\r\nsooner had Stepan Trofimovitch uttered his phrase about Socialists than\r\nLembke went up to him, pushing against Lyamshin, who at once skipped out\r\nof the way with an affected gesture of surprise, rubbing his shoulder\r\nand pretending that he had been terribly bruised.","\"Enough!\" said Von Lembke to Stepan Trofimovitch, vigorously gripping\r\nthe hand of the dismayed gentleman and squeezing it with all his might\r\nin both of his. \"Enough! The filibusters of our day are unmasked. Not\r\nanother word. Measures have been taken....\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke loudly enough to be heard by all the room, and concluded with\r\nenergy. The impression he produced was poignant. Everybody felt that\r\nsomething was wrong.","I saw Yulia Mihailovna turn pale. The effect was\r\nheightened by a trivial accident. After announcing that measures had\r\nbeen taken, Lembke turned sharply and walked quickly towards the door,\r\nbut he had hardly taken two steps when he stumbled over a rug, swerved\r\nforward, and almost fell. For a moment he stood still, looked at the rug\r\nat which he had stumbled, and, uttering aloud \"Change it!\" went out of\r\nthe room.","Yulia Mihailovna ran after him. Her exit was followed by an\r\nuproar, in which it was difficult to distinguish anything. Some said he\r\nwas \"deranged,\" others that he was \"liable to attacks\"; others put their\r\nfingers to their forehead; Lyamshin, in the corner, put his two fingers\r\nabove his forehead. People hinted at some domestic difficulties--in a\r\nwhisper, of course. No one took up his hat; all were waiting.","I don't\r\nknow what Yulia Mihailovna managed to do, but five minutes later she\r\ncame back, doing her utmost to appear composed. She replied evasively\r\nthat Andrey Antonovitch was rather excited, but that it meant nothing,\r\nthat he had been like that from a child, that she knew \"much better,\"\r\nand that the f√™te next day would certainly cheer him up. Then followed a\r\nfew flattering words to Stepan Trofimovitch simply from civility, and a\r\nloud invitation to the members of the committee to open the meeting now,\r\nat once.","Only then, all who were not members of the committee prepared\r\nto go home; but the painful incidents of this fatal day were not yet\r\nover.\r\n\r\nI noticed at the moment when Nikolay Stavrogin came in that Liza looked\r\nquickly and intently at him and was for a long time unable to take her\r\neyes off him--so much so that at last it attracted attention. I saw\r\nMavriky Nikolaevitch bend over her from behind; he seemed to mean to\r\nwhisper something to her, but evidently changed his intention and drew\r\nhimself up quickly, looking round at every one with a guilty air.","Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch too excited curiosity; his face was paler than usual and\r\nthere was a strangely absent-minded look in his eyes. After flinging\r\nhis question at Stepan Trofimovitch he seemed to forget about him\r\naltogether, and I really believe he even forgot to speak to his hostess.\r\nHe did not once look at Liza--not because he did not want to, but I am\r\ncertain because he did not notice her either.","And suddenly, after the\r\nbrief silence that followed Yulia Mihailovna's invitation to open the\r\nmeeting without loss of time, Liza's musical voice, intentionally loud,\r\nwas heard. She called to Stavrogin.\r\n\r\n\"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, a captain who calls himself a relation of\r\nyours, the brother of your wife, and whose name is Lebyadkin, keeps\r\nwriting impertinent letters to me, complaining of you and offering to\r\ntell me some secrets about you.","If he really is a connection of yours,\r\nplease tell him not to annoy me, and save me from this unpleasantness.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a note of desperate challenge in these words--every one\r\nrealised it. The accusation was unmistakable, though perhaps it was a\r\nsurprise to herself. She was like a man who shuts his eyes and throws\r\nhimself from the roof.\r\n\r\nBut Nikolay Stavrogin's answer was even more astounding.","To begin with, it was strange that he was not in the least surprised and\r\nlistened to Liza with unruffled attention. There was no trace of either\r\nconfusion or anger in his face. Simply, firmly, even with an air of\r\nperfect readiness, he answered the fatal question:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have the misfortune to be connected with that man. I have been\r\nthe husband of his sister for nearly five years. You may be sure I will\r\ngive him your message as soon as possible, and I'll answer for it that\r\nhe shan't annoy you again.","\"\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the horror that was reflected on the face of\r\nVarvara Petrovna. With a distracted air she got up from her seat,\r\nlifting up her right hand as though to ward off a blow. Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch looked at her, looked at Liza, at the spectators, and\r\nsuddenly smiled with infinite disdain; he walked deliberately out of the\r\nroom. Every one saw how Liza leapt up from the sofa as soon as he\r\nturned to go and unmistakably made a movement to run after him.","But she\r\ncontrolled herself and did not run after him; she went quietly out of\r\nthe room without saying a word or even looking at anyone, accompanied,\r\nof course, by Mavriky Nikolaevitch, who rushed after her.\r\n\r\nThe uproar and the gossip that night in the town I will not attempt to\r\ndescribe. Varvara Petrovna shut herself up in her town house and Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch, it was said, went straight to Skvoreshniki without\r\nseeing his mother.","Stepan Trofimovitch sent me that evening to _cette\r\nch√®re amie_ to implore her to allow him to come to her, but she would not\r\nsee me. He was terribly overwhelmed; he shed tears. \"Such a marriage!\r\nSuch a marriage! Such an awful thing in the family!\" he kept repeating.\r\nHe remembered Karmazinov, however, and abused him terribly. He set\r\nto work vigorously to prepare for the reading too and--the artistic\r\ntemperament!--rehearsed before the looking-glass and went over all the\r\njokes and witticisms uttered in the course of his life which he had\r\nwritten down in a separate notebook, to insert into his reading next\r\nday.","\"My dear, I do this for the sake of a great idea,\" he said to me,\r\nobviously justifying himself. \"_Cher ami,_ I have been stationary for\r\ntwenty-five years and suddenly I've begun to move--whither, I know\r\nnot--but I've begun to move....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE FETE--FIRST PART\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe f√™te took place in spite of all the perplexities of the preceding\r\n\"Shpigulin\" day.","I believe that even if Lembke had died the previous\r\nnight, the f√™te would still have taken place next morning--so peculiar\r\nwas the significance Yulia Mihailovna attached to it. Alas! up to the\r\nlast moment she was blind and had no inkling of the state of public\r\nfeeling. No one believed at last that the festive day would pass without\r\nsome tremendous scandal, some \"catastrophe\" as some people expressed it,\r\nrubbing their hands in anticipation.","Many people, it is true, tried to\r\nassume a frowning and diplomatic countenance; but, speaking generally,\r\nevery Russian is inordinately delighted at any public scandal and\r\ndisorder. It is true that we did feel something much more serious\r\nthan the mere craving for a scandal: there was a general feeling\r\nof irritation, a feeling of implacable resentment; every one seemed\r\nthoroughly disgusted with everything.","A kind of bewildered cynicism, a\r\nforced, as it were, strained cynicism was predominant in every one. The\r\nonly people who were free from bewilderment were the ladies, and they\r\nwere clear on only one point: their remorseless detestation of Yulia\r\nMihailovna. Ladies of all shades of opinion were agreed in this. And\r\nshe, poor dear, had no suspicion; up to the last hour she was persuaded\r\nthat she was \"surrounded by followers,\" and that they were still\r\n\"fanatically devoted to her.","\"\r\n\r\nI have already hinted that some low fellows of different sorts had\r\nmade their appearance amongst us. In turbulent times of upheaval or\r\ntransition low characters always come to the front everywhere. I am\r\nnot speaking now of the so-called \"advanced\" people who are always in a\r\nhurry to be in advance of every one else (their absorbing anxiety) and\r\nwho always have some more or less definite, though often very stupid,\r\naim.","No, I am speaking only of the riff-raff. In every period of\r\ntransition this riff-raff, which exists in every society, rises to the\r\nsurface, and is not only without any aim but has not even a symptom of\r\nan idea, and merely does its utmost to give expression to uneasiness and\r\nimpatience. Moreover, this riff-raff almost always falls unconsciously\r\nunder the control of the little group of \"advanced people\" who do act\r\nwith a definite aim, and this little group can direct all this rabble\r\nas it pleases, if only it does not itself consist of absolute idiots,\r\nwhich, however, is sometimes the case.","It is said among us now that it\r\nis all over, that Pyotr Stepanovitch was directed by the _Internationale,_\r\nand Yulia Mihailovna by Pyotr Stepanovitch, while she controlled, under\r\nhis rule, a rabble of all sorts. The more sober minds amongst us wonder\r\nat themselves now, and can't understand how they came to be so foolish\r\nat the time.\r\n\r\nWhat constituted the turbulence of our time and what transition it was\r\nwe were passing through I don't know, nor I think does anyone, unless\r\nit were some of those visitors of ours.","Yet the most worthless fellows\r\nsuddenly gained predominant influence, began loudly criticising\r\neverything sacred, though till then they had not dared to open their\r\nmouths, while the leading people, who had till then so satisfactorily\r\nkept the upper hand, began listening to them and holding their peace,\r\nsome even simpered approval in a most shameless way. People like\r\nLyamshin and Telyatnikov, like Gogol's Tentyotnikov, drivelling\r\nhome-bred editions of Radishtchev, wretched little Jews with a mournful\r\nbut haughty smile, guffawing foreigners, poets of advanced tendencies\r\nfrom the capital, poets who made up with peasant coats and tarred boots\r\nfor the lack of tendencies or talents, majors and colonels who ridiculed\r\nthe senselessness of the service, and who would have been ready for an\r\nextra rouble to unbuckle their swords, and take jobs as railway clerks;\r\ngenerals who had abandoned their duties to become lawyers; advanced\r\nmediators, advancing merchants, innumerable divinity students, women\r\nwho were the embodiment of the woman question--all these suddenly gained\r\ncomplete sway among us and over whom? Over the club, the venerable\r\nofficials, over generals with wooden legs, over the very strict and\r\ninaccessible ladies of our local society.","Since even Varvara Petrovna\r\nwas almost at the beck and call of this rabble, right up to the time\r\nof the catastrophe with her son, our other local Minervas may well be\r\npardoned for their temporary aberration. Now all this is attributed,\r\nas I have mentioned already, to the _Internationale._ This idea has taken\r\nsuch root that it is given as the explanation to visitors from other\r\nparts. Only lately councillor Kubrikov, a man of sixty-two, with the\r\nStanislav Order on his breast, came forward uninvited and confessed in\r\na voice full of feeling that he had beyond a shadow of doubt been for\r\nfully three months under the influence of the _Internationale.","_ When with\r\nevery deference for his years and services he was invited to be more\r\ndefinite, he stuck firmly to his original statement, though he could\r\nproduce no evidence except that \"he had felt it in all his feelings,\" so\r\nthat they cross-examined him no further.\r\n\r\nI repeat again, there was still even among us a small group who held\r\nthemselves aloof from the beginning, and even locked themselves up.","But\r\nwhat lock can stand against a law of nature? Daughters will grow up even\r\nin the most careful families, and it is essential for grown-up daughters\r\nto dance.\r\n\r\nAnd so all these people, too, ended by subscribing to the governesses'\r\nfund.\r\n\r\nThe ball was assumed to be an entertainment so brilliant, so\r\nunprecedented; marvels were told about it; there were rumours of princes\r\nfrom a distance with lorgnettes; of ten stewards, all young dandies,\r\nwith rosettes on their left shoulder; of some Petersburg people who\r\nwere setting the thing going; there was a rumour that Karmazinov had\r\nconsented to increase the subscriptions to the fund by reading his _Merci_\r\nin the costume of the governesses of the district; that there would be\r\na literary quadrille all in costume, and every costume would symbolise\r\nsome special line of thought; and finally that \"honest Russian thought\"\r\nwould dance in costume--which would certainly be a complete novelty in\r\nitself.","Who could resist subscribing? Every one subscribed.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe programme of the f√™te was divided into two parts: the literary\r\nmatin√©e from midday till four o'clock, and afterwards a ball from ten\r\no'clock onwards through the night. But in this very programme there lay\r\nconcealed germs of disorder. In the first place, from the very beginning\r\na rumour had gained ground among the public concerning a luncheon\r\nimmediately after the literary matin√©e, or even while it was going\r\non, during an interval arranged expressly for it--a free luncheon, of\r\ncourse, which would form part of the programme and be accompanied by\r\nchampagne.","The immense price of the tickets (three roubles) tended to\r\nconfirm this rumour. \"As though one would subscribe for nothing? The\r\nf√™te is arranged for twenty-four hours, so food must be provided. People\r\nwill get hungry.\" This was how people reasoned in the town. I must admit\r\nthat Yulia Mihailovna did much to confirm this disastrous rumour by her\r\nown heedlessness. A month earlier, under the first spell of the great\r\nproject, she would babble about it to anyone she met; and even sent a\r\nparagraph to one of the Petersburg papers about the toasts and speeches\r\narranged for her f√™te.","What fascinated her most at that time was\r\nthe idea of these toasts; she wanted to propose them herself and was\r\ncontinually composing them in anticipation. They were to make clear what\r\nwas their banner (what was it? I don't mind betting that the poor dear\r\ncomposed nothing after all), they were to get into the Petersburg and\r\nMoscow papers, to touch and fascinate the higher powers and then to\r\nspread the idea over all the provinces of Russia, rousing people to\r\nwonder and imitation.","But for toasts, champagne was essential, and as champagne can't be\r\ndrunk on an empty stomach, it followed that a lunch was essential too.\r\nAfterwards, when by her efforts a committee had been formed and had\r\nattacked the subject more seriously, it was proved clearly to her at\r\nonce that if they were going to dream of banquets there would be very\r\nlittle left for the governesses, however well people subscribed.","There\r\nwere two ways out of the difficulty: either Belshazzar's feast with\r\ntoasts and speeches, and ninety roubles for the governesses, or a\r\nconsiderable sum of money with the f√™te only as a matter of form to\r\nraise it. The committee, however, only wanted to scare her, and had of\r\ncourse worked out a third course of action, which was reasonable and\r\ncombined the advantages of both, that is, a very decent f√™te in every\r\nrespect only without champagne, and so yielding a very respectable sum,\r\nmuch more than ninety roubles.","But Yulia Mihailovna would not agree to\r\nit: her proud spirit revolted from paltry compromise. She decided at\r\nonce that if the original idea could not be carried out they should rush\r\nto the opposite extreme, that is, raise an enormous subscription that\r\nwould be the envy of other provinces. \"The public must understand,\"\r\nshe said at the end of her flaming speech to the committee, \"that\r\nthe attainment of an object of universal human interest is infinitely\r\nloftier than the corporeal enjoyments of the passing moment, that the\r\nf√™te in its essence is only the proclamation of a great idea, and so we\r\nought to be content with the most frugal German ball simply as a symbol,\r\nthat is, if we can't dispense with this detestable ball altogether,\"\r\nso great was the aversion she suddenly conceived for it.","But she was\r\npacified at last. It was then that \"the literary quadrille\" and the\r\nother √¶sthetic items were invented and proposed as substitutes for the\r\ncorporeal enjoyments. It was then that Karmazinov finally consented to\r\nread _Merci_ (until then he had only tantalised them by his hesitation) and\r\nso eradicate the very idea of victuals from the minds of our incontinent\r\npublic. So the ball was once more to be a magnificent function, though\r\nin a different style.","And not to be too ethereal it was decided that tea\r\nwith lemon and round biscuits should be served at the beginning of the\r\nball, and later on \"orchade\" and lemonade and at the end even ices--but\r\nnothing else. For those who always and everywhere are hungry and, still\r\nmore, thirsty, they might open a buffet in the farthest of the suite of\r\nrooms and put it in charge of Prohorovitch, the head cook of the club,\r\nwho would, subject to the strict supervision of the committee, serve\r\nwhatever was wanted, at a fixed charge, and a notice should be put up\r\non the door of the hall that refreshments were extra.","But on the morning\r\nthey decided not to open the buffet at all for fear of disturbing the\r\nreading, though the buffet would have been five rooms off the White Hall\r\nin which Karmazinov had consented to read _Merci._\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the committee, and even the most practical people\r\nin it, attached enormous consequence to this reading. As for people\r\nof poetical tendencies, the marshal's wife, for instance, informed\r\nKarmazinov that after the reading she would immediately order a marble\r\nslab to be put up in the wall of the White Hall with an inscription\r\nin gold letters, that on such a day and year, here, in this place, the\r\ngreat writer of Russia and of Europe had read _Merci_ on laying aside his\r\npen, and so had for the first time taken leave of the Russian public\r\nrepresented by the leading citizens of our town, and that this\r\ninscription would be read by all at the ball, that is, only five hours\r\nafter _Merci_ had been read.","I know for a fact that Karmazinov it was who\r\ninsisted that there should be no buffet in the morning on any account,\r\nwhile he was reading, in spite of some protests from members of the\r\ncommittee that this was rather opposed to our way of doing things.\r\n\r\nThis was the position of affairs, while in the town people were still\r\nreckoning on a Belshazzar feast, that is, on refreshments provided by\r\nthe committee; they believed in this to the last hour.","Even the young\r\nladies were dreaming of masses of sweets and preserves, and something\r\nmore beyond their imagination. Every one knew that the subscriptions had\r\nreached a huge sum, that all the town was struggling to go, that people\r\nwere driving in from the surrounding districts, and that there were\r\nnot tickets enough. It was known, too, that there had been some large\r\nsubscriptions apart from the price paid for tickets: Varvara Petrovna,\r\nfor instance, had paid three hundred roubles for her ticket and had\r\ngiven almost all the flowers from her conservatory to decorate the room.","The marshal's wife, who was a member of the committee, provided the\r\nhouse and the lighting; the club furnished the music, the attendants,\r\nand gave up Prohorovitch for the whole day. There were other\r\ncontributions as well, though lesser ones, so much so indeed that the\r\nidea was mooted of cutting down the price of tickets from three roubles\r\nto two. Indeed, the committee were afraid at first that three roubles\r\nwould be too much for young ladies to pay, and suggested that they might\r\nhave family tickets, so that every family should pay for one daughter\r\nonly, while the other young ladies of the family, even if there were a\r\ndozen specimens, should be admitted free.","But all their apprehensions\r\nturned out to be groundless: it was just the young ladies who did come.\r\nEven the poorest clerks brought their girls, and it was quite evident\r\nthat if they had had no girls it would never have occurred to them to\r\nsubscribe for tickets. One insignificant little secretary brought all\r\nhis seven daughters, to say nothing of his wife and a niece into the\r\nbargain, and every one of these persons held in her hand an entrance\r\nticket that cost three roubles.","It may be imagined what an upheaval it made in the town! One has only to\r\nremember that as the f√™te was divided into two parts every lady needed\r\ntwo costumes for the occasion--a morning one for the matin√©e and a\r\nball dress for the evening. Many middle-class people, as it appeared\r\nafterwards, had pawned everything they had for that day, even the family\r\nlinen, even the sheets, and possibly the mattresses, to the Jews, who\r\nhad been settling in our town in great numbers during the previous two\r\nyears and who became more and more numerous as time went on.","Almost all\r\nthe officials had asked for their salary in advance, and some of the\r\nlandowners sold beasts they could ill spare, and all simply to bring\r\ntheir ladies got up as marchionesses, and to be as good as anybody. The\r\nmagnificence of dresses on this occasion was something unheard of in our\r\nneighbourhood. For a fortnight beforehand the town was overflowing with\r\nfunny stories which were all brought by our wits to Yulia Mihailovna's\r\ncourt.","Caricatures were passed from hand to hand. I have seen some\r\ndrawings of the sort myself, in Yulia Mihailovna's album. All this\r\nreached the ears of the families who were the source of the jokes; I\r\nbelieve this was the cause of the general hatred of Yulia Mihailovna\r\nwhich had grown so strong in the town. People swear and gnash their\r\nteeth when they think of it now. But it was evident, even at the time,\r\nthat if the committee were to displease them in anything, or if anything\r\nwent wrong at the ball, the outburst of indignation would be something\r\nsurprising.","That's why every one was secretly expecting a scandal; and\r\nif it was so confidently expected, how could it fail to come to pass?\r\n\r\nThe orchestra struck up punctually at midday. Being one of the stewards,\r\nthat is, one of the twelve \"young men with a rosette,\" I saw with my own\r\neyes how this day of ignominious memory began. It began with an enormous\r\ncrush at the doors. How was it that everything, including the police,\r\nwent wrong that day? I don't blame the genuine public: the fathers of\r\nfamilies did not crowd, nor did they push against anyone, in spite of\r\ntheir position.","On the contrary, I am told that they were disconcerted\r\neven in the street, at the sight of the crowd shoving in a way unheard\r\nof in our town, besieging the entry and taking it by assault, instead\r\nof simply going in. Meanwhile the carriages kept driving up, and at last\r\nblocked the street. Now, at the time I write, I have good grounds for\r\naffirming that some of the lowest rabble of our town were brought in\r\nwithout tickets by Lyamshin and Liputin, possibly, too, by other people\r\nwho were stewards like me.","Anyway, some complete strangers, who had come\r\nfrom the surrounding districts and elsewhere, were present. As soon as\r\nthese savages entered the hall they began asking where the buffet was,\r\nas though they had been put up to it beforehand, and learning that\r\nthere was no buffet they began swearing with brutal directness, and an\r\nunprecedented insolence; some of them, it is true, were drunk when they\r\ncame.","Some of them were dazed like savages at the splendour of the\r\nhall, as they had never seen anything like it, and subsided for a minute\r\ngazing at it open-mouthed. This great White Hall really was magnificent,\r\nthough the building was falling into decay: it was of immense size, with\r\ntwo rows of windows, with an old-fashioned ceiling covered with gilt\r\ncarving, with a gallery with mirrors on the walls, red and white\r\ndraperies, marble statues (nondescript but still statues) with heavy old\r\nfurniture of the Napoleonic period, white and gold, upholstered in red\r\nvelvet.","At the moment I am describing, a high platform had been put\r\nup for the literary gentlemen who were to read, and the whole hall was\r\nfilled with chairs like the parterre of a theatre with wide aisles for\r\nthe audience.\r\n\r\nBut after the first moments of surprise the most senseless questions and\r\nprotests followed. \"Perhaps we don't care for a reading.... We've paid\r\nour money.... The audience has been impudently swindled.","... This is our\r\nentertainment, not the Lembkes!\" They seemed, in fact, to have been\r\nlet in for this purpose. I remember specially an encounter in which the\r\nprinceling with the stand-up collar and the face of a Dutch doll, whom I\r\nhad met the morning before at Yulia Mihailovna's, distinguished himself.\r\nHe had, at her urgent request, consented to pin a rosette on his left\r\nshoulder and to become one of our stewards.","It turned out that this dumb\r\nwax figure could act after a fashion of his own, if he could not talk.\r\nWhen a colossal pockmarked captain, supported by a herd of rabble\r\nfollowing at his heels, pestered him by asking \"which way to the\r\nbuffet?\" he made a sign to a police sergeant. His hint was promptly\r\nacted upon, and in spite of the drunken captain's abuse he was\r\ndragged out of the hall. Meantime the genuine public began to make its\r\nappearance, and stretched in three long files between the chairs.","The\r\ndisorderly elements began to subside, but the public, even the most\r\n\"respectable\" among them, had a dissatisfied and perplexed air; some of\r\nthe ladies looked positively scared.\r\n\r\nAt last all were seated; the music ceased. People began blowing their\r\nnoses and looking about them. They waited with too solemn an air--which\r\nis always a bad sign. But nothing was to be seen yet of the Lembkes.\r\nSilks, velvets, diamonds glowed and sparkled on every side; whiffs of\r\nfragrance filled the air.","The men were wearing all their decorations,\r\nand the old men were even in uniform. At last the marshal's wife came in\r\nwith Liza. Liza had never been so dazzlingly charming or so splendidly\r\ndressed as that morning. Her hair was done up in curls, her eyes\r\nsparkled, a smile beamed on her face. She made an unmistakable\r\nsensation: people scrutinised her and whispered about her. They said\r\nthat she was looking for Stavrogin, but neither Stavrogin nor Varvara\r\nPetrovna were there.","At the time I did not understand the expression\r\nof her face: why was there so much happiness, such joy, such energy and\r\nstrength in that face? I remembered what had happened the day before and\r\ncould not make it out.\r\n\r\nBut still the Lembkes did not come. This was distinctly a blunder. I\r\nlearned that Yulia Mihailovna waited till the last minute for Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch, without whom she could not stir a step, though she never\r\nadmitted it to herself.","I must mention, in parenthesis, that on the\r\nprevious day Pyotr Stepanovitch had at the last meeting of the committee\r\ndeclined to wear the rosette of a steward, which had disappointed her\r\ndreadfully, even to the point of tears. To her surprise and, later on,\r\nher extreme discomfiture (to anticipate things) he vanished for the\r\nwhole morning and did not make his appearance at the literary matin√©e at\r\nall, so that no one met him till evening.","At last the audience began\r\nto manifest unmistakable signs of impatience. No one appeared on the\r\nplatform either. The back rows began applauding, as in a theatre. The\r\nelderly gentlemen and the ladies frowned. \"The Lembkes are really giving\r\nthemselves unbearable airs.\" Even among the better part of the audience\r\nan absurd whisper began to gain ground that perhaps there would not be a\r\nf√™te at all, that Lembke perhaps was really unwell, and so on and so\r\non.","But, thank God, the Lembkes at last appeared, she was leaning on\r\nhis arm; I must confess I was in great apprehension myself about\r\ntheir appearance. But the legends were disproved, and the truth\r\nwas triumphant. The audience seemed relieved. Lembke himself seemed\r\nperfectly well. Every one, I remember, was of that opinion, for it\r\ncan be imagined how many eyes were turned on him. I may mention,\r\nas characteristic of our society, that there were very few of the\r\nbetter-class people who saw reason to suppose that there was anything\r\nwrong with him; his conduct seemed to them perfectly normal, and so much\r\nso that the action he had taken in the square the morning before was\r\naccepted and approved.","\"That's how it should have been from the first,\" the higher officials\r\ndeclared. \"If a man begins as a philanthropist he has to come to the\r\nsame thing in the end, though he does not see that it was necessary\r\nfrom the point of view of philanthropy itself\"--that, at least, was the\r\nopinion at the club. They only blamed him for having lost his temper.\r\n\"It ought to have been done more coolly, but there, he is a new man,\"\r\nsaid the authorities.","All eyes turned with equal eagerness to Yulia Mihailovna. Of course no\r\none has the right to expect from me an exact account in regard to one\r\npoint: that is a mysterious, a feminine question. But I only know one\r\nthing: on the evening of the previous day she had gone into Andrey\r\nAntonovitch's study and was there with him till long after midnight.\r\nAndrey Antonovitch was comforted and forgiven.","The husband and wife came\r\nto a complete understanding, everything was forgotten, and when at\r\nthe end of the interview Lembke went down on his knees, recalling with\r\nhorror the final incident of the previous night, the exquisite hand,\r\nand after it the lips of his wife, checked the fervent flow of penitent\r\nphrases of the chivalrously delicate gentleman who was limp with\r\nemotion. Every one could see the happiness in her face.","She walked in\r\nwith an open-hearted air, wearing a magnificent dress. She seemed to\r\nbe at the very pinnacle of her heart's desires, the f√™te--the goal and\r\ncrown of her diplomacy--was an accomplished fact. As they walked\r\nto their seats in front of the platform, the Lembkes bowed in all\r\ndirections and responded to greetings. They were at once surrounded. The\r\nmarshal's wife got up to meet them.\r\n\r\nBut at that point a horrid misunderstanding occurred; the orchestra,\r\napropos of nothing, struck up a flourish, not a triumphal march of any\r\nkind, but a simple flourish such as was played at the club when some\r\none's health was drunk at an official dinner.","I know now that Lyamshin,\r\nin his capacity of steward, had arranged this, as though in honour of\r\nthe Lembkes' entrance. Of course he could always excuse it as a blunder\r\nor excessive zeal.... Alas! I did not know at the time that they no\r\nlonger cared even to find excuses, and that all such considerations were\r\nfrom that day a thing of the past. But the flourish was not the end of\r\nit: in the midst of the vexatious astonishment and the smiles of the\r\naudience there was a sudden \"hurrah\" from the end of the hall and from\r\nthe gallery also, apparently in Lembke's honour.","The hurrahs were few,\r\nbut I must confess they lasted for some time. Yulia Mihailovna flushed,\r\nher eyes flashed. Lembke stood still at his chair, and turning towards\r\nthe voices sternly and majestically scanned the audience.... They\r\nhastened to make him sit down. I noticed with dismay the same dangerous\r\nsmile on his face as he had worn the morning before, in his wife's\r\ndrawing-room, when he stared at Stepan Trofimovitch before going up to\r\nhim.","It seemed to me that now, too, there was an ominous, and, worst of\r\nall, a rather comic expression on his countenance, the expression of a\r\nman resigned to sacrifice himself to satisfy his wife's lofty aims....\r\nYulia Mihailovna beckoned to me hurriedly, and whispered to me to run\r\nto Karmazinov and entreat him to begin. And no sooner had I turned away\r\nthan another disgraceful incident, much more unpleasant than the first,\r\ntook place.","On the platform, the empty platform, on which till that moment all eyes\r\nand all expectations were fastened, and where nothing was to be seen but\r\na small table, a chair in front of it, and on the table a glass of water\r\non a silver salver--on the empty platform there suddenly appeared the\r\ncolossal figure of Captain Lebyadkin wearing a dress-coat and a white\r\ntie. I was so astounded I could not believe my eyes.","The captain seemed\r\nconfused and remained standing at the back of the platform. Suddenly\r\nthere was a shout in the audience, \"Lebyadkin! You?\" The captain's\r\nstupid red face (he was hopelessly drunk) expanded in a broad vacant\r\ngrin at this greeting. He raised his hand, rubbed his forehead with it,\r\nshook his shaggy head and, as though making up his mind to go through\r\nwith it, took two steps forward and suddenly went off into a series\r\nof prolonged, blissful, gurgling, but not loud guffaws, which made him\r\nscrew up his eyes and set all his bulky person heaving.","This spectacle\r\nset almost half the audience laughing, twenty people applauded. The\r\nserious part of the audience looked at one another gloomily; it all\r\nlasted only half a minute, however. Liputin, wearing his steward's\r\nrosette, ran on to the platform with two servants; they carefully took\r\nthe captain by both arms, while Liputin whispered something to him.\r\nThe captain scowled, muttered \"Ah, well, if that's it!\" waved his hand,\r\nturned his huge back to the public and vanished with his escort.","But a\r\nminute later Liputin skipped on to the platform again. He was wearing\r\nthe sweetest of his invariable smiles, which usually suggested vinegar\r\nand sugar, and carried in his hands a sheet of note-paper. With tiny but\r\nrapid steps he came forward to the edge of the platform.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said, addressing the public, \"through our\r\ninadvertency there has arisen a comical misunderstanding which has been\r\nremoved; but I've hopefully undertaken to do something at the earnest\r\nand most respectful request of one of our local poets.","Deeply touched by\r\nthe humane and lofty object... in spite of his appearance... the object\r\nwhich has brought us all together... to wipe away the tears of the poor\r\nbut well-educated girls of our province... this gentleman, I mean this\r\nlocal poet... although desirous of preserving his incognito, would\r\ngladly have heard his poem read at the beginning of the ball... that is,\r\nI mean, of the matin√©e.","Though this poem is not in the programme...\r\nfor it has only been received half an hour ago... yet it has seemed to\r\n_us_\"--(Us? Whom did he mean by us? I report his confused and incoherent\r\nspeech word for word)--\"that through its remarkable na√Øvet√© of feeling,\r\ntogether with its equally remarkable gaiety, the poem might well be\r\nread, that is, not as something serious, but as something appropriate to\r\nthe occasion, that is to the idea.",".. especially as some lines... And I\r\nwanted to ask the kind permission of the audience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Read it!\" boomed a voice at the back of the hall.\r\n\r\n\"Then I am to read it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Read it, read it!\" cried many voices.\r\n\r\n\"With the permission of the audience I will read it,\" Liputin minced\r\nagain, still with the same sugary smile. He still seemed to hesitate,\r\nand I even thought that he was rather excited.","These people are\r\nsometimes nervous in spite of their impudence. A divinity student would\r\nhave carried it through without winking, but Liputin did, after all,\r\nbelong to the last generation.\r\n\r\n\"I must say, that is, I have the honour to say by way of preface, that\r\nit is not precisely an ode such as used to be written for f√™tes, but is\r\nrather, so to say, a jest, but full of undoubted feeling, together with\r\nplayful humour, and, so to say, the most realistic truthfulness.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Read it, read it!\"\r\n\r\nHe unfolded the paper. No one of course was in time to stop him.\r\nBesides, he was wearing his steward's badge. In a ringing voice he\r\ndeclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"To the local governesses of the Fatherland from the poet at the f√™te:\r\n\r\n     \"Governesses all, good morrow,\r\n     Triumph on this festive day.\r\n     Retrograde or vowed George-Sander--\r\n     Never mind, just frisk away!\"\r\n\r\n\"But that's Lebyadkin's! Lebyadkin's!\" cried several voices.","There was\r\nlaughter and even applause, though not from very many.\r\n\r\n     \"Teaching French to wet-nosed children,\r\n     You are glad enough to think\r\n     You can catch a worn-out sexton--\r\n     Even he is worth a wink!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah! hurrah!\"\r\n\r\n     \"But in these great days of progress,\r\n     Ladies, to your sorrow know,\r\n     You can't even catch a sexton,\r\n     If you have not got a 'dot'.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure, to be sure, that's realism.","You can't hook a husband\r\nwithout a 'dot'!\"\r\n\r\n     \"But, henceforth, since through our feasting\r\n     Capital has flowed from all,\r\n     And we send you forth to conquest\r\n     Dancing, dowried from this hall--\r\n     Retrograde or vowed George-Sander,\r\n     Never mind, rejoice you may,\r\n     You're a governess with a dowry,\r\n     Spit on all and frisk away!\"\r\n\r\nI must confess I could not believe my ears.","The insolence of it was so\r\nunmistakable that there was no possibility of excusing Liputin on\r\nthe ground of stupidity. Besides, Liputin was by no means stupid. The\r\nintention was obvious, to me, anyway; they seemed in a hurry to create\r\ndisorder. Some lines in these idiotic verses, for instance the last,\r\nwere such that no stupidity could have let them pass. Liputin himself\r\nseemed to feel that he had undertaken too much; when he had achieved\r\nhis exploit he was so overcome by his own impudence that he did not even\r\nleave the platform but remained standing, as though there were something\r\nmore he wanted to say.","He had probably imagined that it would somehow\r\nproduce a different effect; but even the group of ruffians who had\r\napplauded during the reading suddenly sank into silence, as though they,\r\ntoo, were overcome. What was silliest of all, many of them took the\r\nwhole episode seriously, that is, did not regard the verses as a lampoon\r\nbut actually thought it realistic and true as regards the governesses--a\r\npoem with a tendency, in fact.","But the excessive freedom of the verses\r\nstruck even them at last; as for the general public they were not only\r\nscandalised but obviously offended. I am sure I am not mistaken as to\r\nthe impression. Yulia Mihailovna said afterwards that in another moment\r\nshe would have fallen into a swoon. One of the most respectable old\r\ngentlemen helped his old wife on to her feet, and they walked out of the\r\nhall accompanied by the agitated glances of the audience.","Who knows,\r\nthe example might have infected others if Karmazinov himself, wearing a\r\ndress-coat and a white tie and carrying a manuscript, in his hand, had\r\nnot appeared on the platform at that moment. Yulia Mihailovna turned\r\nan ecstatic gaze at him as on her deliverer.... But I was by that time\r\nbehind the scenes. I was in quest of Liputin.\r\n\r\n\"You did that on purpose!\" I said, seizing him indignantly by the arm.","\"I assure you I never thought...\" he began, cringing and lying at once,\r\npretending to be unhappy. \"The verses had only just been brought and I\r\nthought that as an amusing pleasantry....\"\r\n\r\n\"You did not think anything of the sort. You can't really think that\r\nstupid rubbish an amusing pleasantry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are simply lying, and it wasn't brought to you just now. You helped\r\nLebyadkin to compose it yourself, yesterday very likely, to create a\r\nscandal.","The last verse must have been yours, the part about the sexton\r\ntoo. Why did he come on in a dress-coat? You must have meant him to read\r\nit, too, if he had not been drunk?\"\r\n\r\nLiputin looked at me coldly and ironically.\r\n\r\n\"What business is it of yours?\" he asked suddenly with strange calm.\r\n\r\n\"What business is it of mine? You are wearing the steward's badge,\r\ntoo.... Where is Pyotr Stepanovitch?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, somewhere here; why do you ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because now I see through it.","It's simply a plot against Yulia\r\nMihailovna so as to ruin the day by a scandal....\"\r\n\r\nLiputin looked at me askance again.\r\n\r\n\"But what is it to you?\" he said, grinning. He shrugged his shoulders\r\nand walked away.\r\n\r\nIt came over me with a rush. All my suspicions were confirmed. Till\r\nthen, I had been hoping I was mistaken! What was I to do? I was on the\r\npoint of asking the advice of Stepan Trofimovitch, but he was standing\r\nbefore the looking-glass, trying on different smiles, and continually\r\nconsulting a piece of paper on which he had notes.","He had to go\r\non immediately after Karmazinov, and was not in a fit state for\r\nconversation. Should I run to Yulia Mihailovna? But it was too soon\r\nto go to her: she needed a much sterner lesson to cure her of\r\nher conviction that she had \"a following,\" and that every one was\r\n\"fanatically devoted\" to her. She would not have believed me, and would\r\nhave thought I was dreaming. Besides, what help could she be? \"Eh,\" I\r\nthought, \"after all, what business is it of mine? I'll take off my\r\nbadge and go home _when it begins.","_\" That was my mental phrase, \"when it\r\nbegins\"; I remember it.\r\n\r\nBut I had to go and listen to Karmazinov. Taking a last look round\r\nbehind the scenes, I noticed that a good number of outsiders, even women\r\namong them, were flitting about, going in and out. \"Behind the scenes\"\r\nwas rather a narrow space completely screened from the audience by a\r\ncurtain and communicating with other rooms by means of a passage.","Here\r\nour readers were awaiting their turns. But I was struck at that moment\r\nby the reader who was to follow Stepan Trofimovitch. He, too, was some\r\nsort of professor (I don't know to this day exactly what he was) who had\r\nvoluntarily left some educational institution after a disturbance among\r\nthe students, and had arrived in the town only a few days before. He,\r\ntoo, had been recommended to Yulia Mihailovna, and she had received him\r\nwith reverence.","I know now that he had only spent one evening in her\r\ncompany before the reading; he had not spoken all that evening, had\r\nlistened with an equivocal smile to the jests and the general tone of\r\nthe company surrounding Yulia Mihailovna, and had made an unpleasant\r\nimpression on every one by his air of haughtiness, and at the same\r\ntime almost timorous readiness to take offence. It was Yulia Mihailovna\r\nherself who had enlisted his services.","Now he was walking from corner to\r\ncorner, and, like Stepan Trofimovitch, was muttering to himself, though\r\nhe looked on the ground instead of in the looking-glass. He was not\r\ntrying on smiles, though he often smiled rapaciously. It was obvious\r\nthat it was useless to speak to him either. He looked about forty, was\r\nshort and bald, had a greyish beard, and was decently dressed. But what\r\nwas most interesting about him was that at every turn he took he threw\r\nup his right fist, brandished it above his head and suddenly brought it\r\ndown again as though crushing an antagonist to atoms.","He went through\r\nthis by-play every moment. It made me uncomfortable. I hastened away to\r\nlisten to Karmazinov.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThere was a feeling in the hall that something was wrong again. Let me\r\nstate to begin with that I have the deepest reverence for genius, but\r\nwhy do our geniuses in the decline of their illustrious years behave\r\nsometimes exactly like little boys? What though he was Karmazinov, and\r\ncame forward with as much dignity as five _Kammerherrs_ rolled into one?\r\nHow could he expect to keep an audience like ours listening for a whole\r\nhour to a single paper? I have observed, in fact, that however big a\r\ngenius a man may be, he can't monopolise the attention of an audience at\r\na frivolous literary matin√©e for more than twenty minutes with impunity.","The entrance of the great writer was received, indeed, with the utmost\r\nrespect: even the severest elderly men showed signs of approval and\r\ninterest, and the ladies even displayed some enthusiasm. The applause\r\nwas brief, however, and somehow uncertain and not unanimous. Yet there\r\nwas no unseemly behaviour in the back rows, till Karmazinov began to\r\nspeak, not that anything very bad followed then, but only a sort of\r\nmisunderstanding.","I have mentioned already that he had rather a shrill\r\nvoice, almost feminine in fact, and at the same time a genuinely\r\naristocratic lisp. He had hardly articulated a few words when someone\r\nhad the effrontery to laugh aloud--probably some ignorant simpleton who\r\nknew nothing of the world, and was congenitally disposed to laughter.\r\nBut there was nothing like a hostile demonstration; on the contrary\r\npeople said \"sh-h!\" and the offender was crushed.","But Mr. Karmazinov,\r\nwith an affected air and intonation, announced that \"at first he had\r\ndeclined absolutely to read.\" (Much need there was to mention it!)\r\n\"There are some lines which come so deeply from the heart that it is\r\nimpossible to utter them aloud, so that these holy things cannot be laid\r\nbefore the public\"--(Why lay them then?)--\"but as he had been begged\r\nto do so, he was doing so, and as he was, moreover, laying down his\r\npen forever, and had sworn to write no more, he had written this last\r\nfarewell; and as he had sworn never, on any inducement, to read anything\r\nin public,\" and so on, and so on, all in that style.","But all that would not have mattered; every one knows what authors'\r\nprefaces are like, though, I may observe, that considering the lack of\r\nculture of our audience and the irritability of the back rows, all this\r\nmay have had an influence. Surely it would have been better to have\r\nread a little story, a short tale such as he had written in the\r\npast--over-elaborate, that is, and affected, but sometimes witty.","It\r\nwould have saved the situation. No, this was quite another story! It was\r\na regular oration! Good heavens, what wasn't there in it! I am positive\r\nthat it would have reduced to rigidity even a Petersburg audience, let\r\nalone ours. Imagine an article that would have filled some thirty pages\r\nof print of the most affected, aimless prattle; and to make matters\r\nworse, the gentleman read it with a sort of melancholy condescension\r\nas though it were a favour, so that it was almost insulting to the\r\naudience.","The subject.... Who could make it out? It was a sort of\r\ndescription of certain impressions and reminiscences. But of what? And\r\nabout what? Though the leading intellects of the province did their\r\nutmost during the first half of the reading, they could make nothing\r\nof it, and they listened to the second part simply out of politeness.\r\nA great deal was said about love, indeed, of the love of the genius for\r\nsome person, but I must admit it made rather an awkward impression.","For\r\nthe great writer to tell us about his first kiss seemed to my mind a\r\nlittle incongruous with his short and fat little figure... Another thing\r\nthat was offensive; these kisses did not occur as they do with the rest\r\nof mankind. There had to be a framework of gorse (it had to be gorse or\r\nsome such plant that one must look up in a flora) and there had to be a\r\ntint of purple in the sky, such as no mortal had ever observed before,\r\nor if some people had seen it, they had never noticed it, but he seemed\r\nto say, \"I have seen it and am describing it to you, fools, as if it\r\nwere a most ordinary thing.","\" The tree under which the interesting couple\r\nsat had of course to be of an orange colour. They were sitting somewhere\r\nin Germany. Suddenly they see Pompey or Cassius on the eve of a battle,\r\nand both are penetrated by a thrill of ecstasy. Some wood-nymph squeaked\r\nin the bushes. Gluck played the violin among the reeds. The title of the\r\npiece he was playing was given in full, but no one knew it, so that one\r\nwould have had to look it up in a musical dictionary.","Meanwhile a fog\r\ncame on, such a fog, such a fog, that it was more like a million pillows\r\nthan a fog. And suddenly everything disappears and the great genius is\r\ncrossing the frozen Volga in a thaw. Two and a half pages are filled\r\nwith the crossing, and yet he falls through the ice. The genius is\r\ndrowning--you imagine he was drowned? Not a bit of it; this was simply\r\nin order that when he was drowning and at his last gasp, he might catch\r\nsight of a bit of ice, the size of a pea, but pure and crystal \"as a\r\nfrozen tear,\" and in that tear was reflected Germany, or more accurately\r\nthe sky of Germany, and its iridescent sparkle recalled to his mind the\r\nvery tear which \"dost thou remember, fell from thine eyes when we were\r\nsitting under that emerald tree, and thou didst cry out joyfully: 'There\r\nis no crime!' 'No,' I said through my tears, 'but if that is so, there\r\nare no righteous either.","' We sobbed and parted forever.\" She went off\r\nsomewhere to the sea coast, while he went to visit some caves, and then\r\nhe descends and descends and descends for three years under Suharev\r\nTower in Moscow, and suddenly in the very bowels of the earth, he finds\r\nin a cave a lamp, and before the lamp a hermit. The hermit is praying.\r\nThe genius leans against a little barred window, and suddenly hears a\r\nsigh.","Do you suppose it was the hermit sighing? Much he cares about the\r\nhermit! Not a bit of it, this sigh simply reminds him of her first sigh,\r\nthirty-seven years before, \"in Germany, when, dost thou remember, we sat\r\nunder an agate tree and thou didst say to me, 'Why love? See ochra is\r\ngrowing all around and I love thee; but the ochra will cease to grow,\r\nand I shall cease to love.'\" Then the fog comes on again, Hoffman\r\nappears on the scene, the wood-nymph whistles a tune from Chopin, and\r\nsuddenly out of the fog appears Ancus Marcius over the roofs of Rome,\r\nwearing a laurel wreath.","\"A chill of ecstasy ran down our backs and we\r\nparted forever\"--and so on and so on.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I am not reporting it quite right and don't know how to report\r\nit, but the drift of the babble was something of that sort. And after\r\nall, how disgraceful this passion of our great intellects for jesting in\r\na superior way really is! The great European philosopher, the great man\r\nof science, the inventor, the martyr--all these who labour and are heavy\r\nladen, are to the great Russian genius no more than so many cooks in his\r\nkitchen.","He is the master and they come to him, cap in hand, awaiting\r\norders. It is true he jeers superciliously at Russia too, and there\r\nis nothing he likes better than exhibiting the bankruptcy of Russia in\r\nevery relation before the great minds of Europe, but as regards himself,\r\nno, he is at a higher level than all the great minds of Europe; they are\r\nonly material for his jests. He takes another man's idea, tacks on to it\r\nits antithesis, and the epigram is made.","There is such a thing as crime,\r\nthere is no such thing as crime; there is no such thing as justice,\r\nthere are no just men; atheism, Darwinism, the Moscow bells.... But\r\nalas, he no longer believes in the Moscow bells; Rome, laurels.... But\r\nhe has no belief in laurels even.... We have a conventional attack of\r\nByronic spleen, a grimace from Heine, something of Petchorin--and the\r\nmachine goes on rolling, whistling, at full speed.","\"But you may praise\r\nme, you may praise me, that I like extremely; it's only in a manner of\r\nspeaking that I lay down the pen; I shall bore you three hundred times\r\nmore, you'll grow weary of reading me....\"\r\n\r\nOf course it did not end without trouble; but the worst of it was that\r\nit was his own doing. People had for some time begun shuffling their\r\nfeet, blowing their noses, coughing, and doing everything that people\r\ndo when a lecturer, whoever he may be, keeps an audience for longer than\r\ntwenty minutes at a literary matin√©e.","But the genius noticed nothing of\r\nall this. He went on lisping and mumbling, without giving a thought to\r\nthe audience, so that every one began to wonder. Suddenly in a back row\r\na solitary but loud voice was heard:\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord, what nonsense!\"\r\n\r\nThe exclamation escaped involuntarily, and I am sure was not intended\r\nas a demonstration. The man was simply worn out. But Mr. Karmazinov\r\nstopped, looked sarcastically at the audience, and suddenly lisped with\r\nthe deportment of an aggrieved _kammerherr.","_\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I've been boring you dreadfully, gentlemen?\"\r\n\r\nThat was his blunder, that he was the first to speak; for provoking an\r\nanswer in this way he gave an opening for the rabble to speak, too, and\r\neven legitimately, so to say, while if he had restrained himself, people\r\nwould have gone on blowing their noses and it would have passed off\r\nsomehow. Perhaps he expected applause in response to his question, but\r\nthere was no sound of applause; on the contrary, every one seemed to\r\nsubside and shrink back in dismay.","\"You never did see Ancus Marcius, that's all brag,\" cried a voice that\r\nsounded full of irritation and even nervous exhaustion.\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" another voice agreed at once. \"There are no such things as\r\nghosts nowadays, nothing but natural science. Look it up in a scientific\r\nbook.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, there was nothing I expected less than such objections,\"\r\nsaid Karmazinov, extremely surprised. The great genius had completely\r\nlost touch with his Fatherland in Karlsruhe.","\"Nowadays it's outrageous to say that the world stands on three fishes,\"\r\na young lady snapped out suddenly. \"You can't have gone down to the\r\nhermit's cave, Karmazinov. And who talks about hermits nowadays?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, what surprises me most of all is that you take it all so\r\nseriously. However... however, you are perfectly right. No one has\r\ngreater respect for truth and realism than I have.","...\"\r\n\r\nThough he smiled ironically he was tremendously overcome. His face\r\nseemed to express: \"I am not the sort of man you think, I am on your\r\nside, only praise me, praise me more, as much as possible, I like it\r\nextremely....\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he cried, completely mortified at last, \"I see that my poor\r\npoem is quite out of place here. And, indeed, I am out of place here\r\nmyself, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"You threw at the crow and you hit the cow,\" some fool, probably drunk,\r\nshouted at the top of his voice, and of course no notice ought to\r\nhave been taken of him.","It is true there was a sound of disrespectful\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\"A cow, you say?\" Karmazinov caught it up at once, his voice grew\r\nshriller and shriller. \"As for crows and cows, gentlemen, I will\r\nrefrain. I've too much respect for any audience to permit myself\r\ncomparisons, however harmless; but I did think...\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better be careful, sir,\" someone shouted from a back row.\r\n\r\n\"But I had supposed that laying aside my pen and saying farewell to my\r\nreaders, I should be heard.","..\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, we want to hear you, we want to,\" a few voices from the front\r\nrow plucked up spirit to exclaim at last.\r\n\r\n\"Read, read!\" several enthusiastic ladies' voices chimed in, and at last\r\nthere was an outburst of applause, sparse and feeble, it is true.\r\n\r\n\"Believe me, Karmazinov, every one looks on it as an honour...\" the\r\nmarshal's wife herself could not resist saying.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Karmazinov!\" cried a fresh young voice in the back of the hall\r\nsuddenly.","It was the voice of a very young teacher from the district\r\nschool who had only lately come among us, an excellent young man, quiet\r\nand gentlemanly. He stood up in his place. \"Mr. Karmazinov, if I had\r\nthe happiness to fall in love as you have described to us, I really\r\nshouldn't refer to my love in an article intended for public\r\nreading....\" He flushed red all over.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" cried Karmazinov, \"I have finished.","I will omit\r\nthe end and withdraw. Only allow me to read the six last lines:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear reader, farewell!\" he began at once from the manuscript\r\nwithout sitting down again in his chair. \"Farewell, reader; I do not\r\ngreatly insist on our parting friends; what need to trouble you,\r\nindeed. You may abuse me, abuse me as you will if it affords you any\r\nsatisfaction. But best of all if we forget one another forever.","And\r\nif you all, readers, were suddenly so kind as to fall on your knees and\r\nbegin begging me with tears, 'Write, oh, write for us, Karmazinov--for\r\nthe sake of Russia, for the sake of posterity, to win laurels,' even\r\nthen I would answer you, thanking you, of course, with every courtesy,\r\n'No, we've had enough of one another, dear fellow-countrymen, _merci!_\r\nIt's time we took our separate ways!' _Merci, merci, merci!_\"\r\n\r\nKarmazinov bowed ceremoniously, and, as red as though he had been\r\ncooked, retired behind the scenes.","\"Nobody would go down on their knees; a wild idea!\"\r\n\r\n\"What conceit!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's only humour,\" someone more reasonable suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Spare me your humour.\"\r\n\r\n\"I call it impudence, gentlemen!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he's finished now, anyway!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ech, what a dull show!\"\r\n\r\nBut all these ignorant exclamations in the back rows (though they were\r\nconfined to the back rows) were drowned in applause from the other half\r\nof the audience.","They called for Karmazinov. Several ladies with Yulia\r\nMihailovna and the marshal's wife crowded round the platform. In Yulia\r\nMihailovna's hands was a gorgeous laurel wreath resting on another\r\nwreath of living roses on a white velvet cushion.\r\n\r\n\"Laurels!\" Karmazinov pronounced with a subtle and rather sarcastic\r\nsmile. \"I am touched, of course, and accept with real emotion this\r\nwreath prepared beforehand, but still fresh and unwithered, but I assure\r\nyou, mesdames, that I have suddenly become so realistic that I feel\r\nlaurels would in this age be far more appropriate in the hands of a\r\nskilful cook than in mine.","...\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, a cook is more useful,\" cried the divinity student, who had been\r\nat the \"meeting\" at Virginsky's.\r\n\r\nThere was some disorder. In many rows people jumped up to get a better\r\nview of the presentation of the laurel wreath.\r\n\r\n\"I'd give another three roubles for a cook this minute,\" another voice\r\nassented loudly, too loudly; insistently, in fact.\r\n\r\n\"So would I.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible there's no buffet?.","..\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, it's simply a swindle....\"\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, however, that all these unbridled gentlemen still\r\nstood in awe of our higher officials and of the police superintendent,\r\nwho was present in the hall. Ten minutes later all had somehow got back\r\ninto their places, but there was not the same good order as before.\r\nAnd it was into this incipient chaos that poor Stepan Trofimovitch was\r\nthrust.","IV\r\n\r\nI ran out to him behind the scenes once more, and had time to warn him\r\nexcitedly that in my opinion the game was up, that he had better not\r\nappear at all, but had better go home at once on the excuse of his usual\r\nailment, for instance, and I would take off my badge and come with him.\r\nAt that instant he was on his way to the platform; he stopped suddenly,\r\nand haughtily looking me up and down he pronounced solemnly:\r\n\r\n\"What grounds have you, sir, for thinking me capable of such baseness?\"\r\n\r\nI drew back.","I was as sure as twice two make four that he would not get\r\noff without a catastrophe. Meanwhile, as I stood utterly dejected, I saw\r\nmoving before me again the figure of the professor, whose turn it was to\r\nappear after Stepan Trofimovitch, and who kept lifting up his fist\r\nand bringing it down again with a swing. He kept walking up and down,\r\nabsorbed in himself and muttering something to himself with a diabolical\r\nbut triumphant smile.","I somehow almost unintentionally went up to him.\r\nI don't know what induced me to meddle again. \"Do you know,\" I said,\r\n\"judging from many examples, if a lecturer keeps an audience for more\r\nthan twenty minutes it won't go on listening. No celebrity is able to\r\nhold his own for half an hour.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped short and seemed almost quivering with resentment. Infinite\r\ndisdain was expressed in his countenance.","\"Don't trouble yourself,\" he muttered contemptuously and walked on. At\r\nthat moment Stepan Trofimovitch's voice rang out in the hall.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hang you all,\" I thought, and ran to the hall.\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch took his seat in the lecturer's chair in the midst\r\nof the still persisting disorder. He was greeted by the first rows with\r\nlooks which were evidently not over-friendly. (Of late, at the club,\r\npeople almost seemed not to like him, and treated him with much less\r\nrespect than formerly.",") But it was something to the good that he was not\r\nhissed. I had had a strange idea in my head ever since the previous\r\nday: I kept fancying that he would be received with hisses as soon as\r\nhe appeared. They scarcely noticed him, however, in the disorder. What\r\ncould that man hope for if Karmazinov was treated like this? He was\r\npale; it was ten years since he had appeared before an audience. From\r\nhis excitement and from all that I knew so well in him, it was clear to\r\nme that he, too, regarded his present appearance on the platform as a\r\nturning-point of his fate, or something of the kind.","That was just what\r\nI was afraid of. The man was dear to me. And what were my feelings when\r\nhe opened his lips and I heard his first phrase?\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he pronounced suddenly, as though resolved to\r\nventure everything, though in an almost breaking voice. \"Ladies and\r\ngentlemen! Only this morning there lay before me one of the illegal\r\nleaflets that have been distributed here lately, and I asked myself for\r\nthe hundredth time, 'Wherein lies its secret?'\"\r\n\r\nThe whole hall became instantly still, all looks were turned to him,\r\nsome with positive alarm.","There was no denying, he knew how to secure\r\ntheir interest from the first word. Heads were thrust out from behind\r\nthe scenes; Liputin and Lyamshin listened greedily. Yulia Mihailovna\r\nwaved to me again.\r\n\r\n\"Stop him, whatever happens, stop him,\" she whispered in agitation.\r\nI could only shrug my shoulders: how could one stop a man resolved to\r\nventure everything? Alas, I understood what was in Stepan Trofimovitch's\r\nmind.","\"Ha ha, the manifestoes!\" was whispered in the audience; the whole hall\r\nwas stirred.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, I've solved the whole mystery. The whole secret\r\nof their effect lies in their stupidity.\" (His eyes flashed.) \"Yes,\r\ngentlemen, if this stupidity were intentional, pretended and calculated,\r\noh, that would be a stroke of genius! But we must do them justice:\r\nthey don't pretend anything.","It's the barest, most simple-hearted,\r\nmost shallow stupidity. _C'est la b√™tise dans son essence la plus pure,\r\nquelque chose comme un simple chimique._ If it were expressed ever so\r\nlittle more cleverly, every one would see at once the poverty of this\r\nshallow stupidity. But as it is, every one is left wondering: no one\r\ncan believe that it is such elementary stupidity. 'It's impossible that\r\nthere's nothing more in it,' every one says to himself and tries to\r\nfind the secret of it, sees a mystery in it, tries to read between the\r\nlines--the effect is attained! Oh, never has stupidity been so solemnly\r\nrewarded, though it has so often deserved it.","... For, _en parenthese,_\r\nstupidity is of as much service to humanity as the loftiest genius....\"\r\n\r\n\"Epigram of 1840\" was commented, in a very modest voice, however, but it\r\nwas followed by a general outbreak of noise and uproar.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, hurrah! I propose a toast to stupidity!\" cried\r\nStepan Trofimovitch, defying the audience in a perfect frenzy.\r\n\r\nI ran up on the pretext of pouring out some water for him.","\"Stepan Trofimovitch, leave off, Yulia Mihailovna entreats you to.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you leave me alone, idle young man,\" he cried out at me at the top\r\nof his voice. I ran away. \"Messieurs,\" he went on, \"why this excitement,\r\nwhy the outcries of indignation I hear? I have come forward with an\r\nolive branch. I bring you the last word, for in this business I have the\r\nlast word--and we shall be reconciled.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Down with him!\" shouted some.\r\n\r\n\"Hush, let him speak, let him have his say!\" yelled another section. The\r\nyoung teacher was particularly excited; having once brought himself to\r\nspeak he seemed now unable to be silent.\r\n\r\n\"Messieurs, the last word in this business--is forgiveness. I, an old\r\nman at the end of my life, I solemnly declare that the spirit of life\r\nbreathes in us still, and there is still a living strength in the young\r\ngeneration.","The enthusiasm of the youth of today is as pure and bright\r\nas in our age. All that has happened is a change of aim, the replacing\r\nof one beauty by another! The whole difficulty lies in the question\r\nwhich is more beautiful, Shakespeare or boots, Raphael or petroleum?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's treachery!\" growled some.\r\n\r\n\"Compromising questions!\"\r\n\r\n_\"Agent provocateur!\"_\r\n\r\n\"But I maintain,\" Stepan Trofimovitch shrilled at the utmost pitch of\r\nexcitement, \"I maintain that Shakespeare and Raphael are more precious\r\nthan the emancipation of the serfs, more precious than Nationalism, more\r\nprecious than Socialism, more precious than the young generation, more\r\nprecious than chemistry, more precious than almost all humanity because\r\nthey are the fruit, the real fruit of all humanity and perhaps the\r\nhighest fruit that can be.","A form of beauty already attained, but for\r\nthe attaining of which I would not perhaps consent to live.... Oh,\r\nheavens!\" he cried, clasping his hands, \"ten years ago I said the same\r\nthing from the platform in Petersburg, exactly the same thing, in the\r\nsame words, and in just the same way they did not understand it, they\r\nlaughed and hissed as now; shallow people, what is lacking in you that\r\nyou cannot understand? But let me tell you, let me tell you, without the\r\nEnglish, life is still possible for humanity, without Germany, life is\r\npossible, without the Russians it is only too possible, without science,\r\nwithout bread, life is possible--only without beauty it is impossible,\r\nfor there will be nothing left in the world.","That's the secret at the\r\nbottom of everything, that's what history teaches! Even science would\r\nnot exist a moment without beauty--do you know that, you who laugh--it\r\nwill sink into bondage, you won't invent a nail even!... I won't yield an\r\ninch!\" he shouted absurdly in confusion, and with all his might banged\r\nhis fist on the table.\r\n\r\nBut all the while that he was shrieking senselessly and incoherently,\r\nthe disorder in the hall increased.","Many people jumped up from their\r\nseats, some dashed forward, nearer to the platform. It all happened much\r\nmore quickly than I describe it, and there was no time to take steps,\r\nperhaps no wish to, either.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right for you, with everything found for you, you pampered\r\ncreatures!\" the same divinity student bellowed at the foot of the\r\nplatform, grinning with relish at Stepan Trofimovitch, who noticed it\r\nand darted to the very edge of the platform.","\"Haven't I, haven't I just declared that the enthusiasm of the young\r\ngeneration is as pure and bright as it was, and that it is coming to\r\ngrief through being deceived only in the forms of beauty! Isn't that\r\nenough for you? And if you consider that he who proclaims this is a\r\nfather crushed and insulted, can one--oh, shallow hearts--can one\r\nrise to greater heights of impartiality and fairness?.",".. Ungrateful...\r\nunjust.... Why, why can't you be reconciled!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he burst into hysterical sobs. He wiped away his dropping tears with\r\nhis fingers. His shoulders and breast were heaving with sobs. He was\r\nlost to everything in the world.\r\n\r\nA perfect panic came over the audience, almost all got up from their\r\nseats. Yulia Mihailovna, too, jumped up quickly, seizing her husband by\r\nthe arm and pulling him up too.","... The scene was beyond all belief.\r\n\r\n\"Stepan Trofimovitch!\" the divinity student roared gleefully. \"There's\r\nFedka the convict wandering about the town and the neighbourhood,\r\nescaped from prison. He is a robber and has recently committed another\r\nmurder. Allow me to ask you: if you had not sold him as a recruit\r\nfifteen years ago to pay a gambling debt, that is, more simply, lost\r\nhim at cards, tell me, would he have got into prison? Would he have cut\r\nmen's throats now, in his struggle for existence? What do you say, Mr.","√Üsthete?\"\r\n\r\nI decline to describe the scene that followed. To begin with there was a\r\nfurious volley of applause. The applause did not come from all--probably\r\nfrom some fifth part of the audience--but they applauded furiously. The\r\nrest of the public made for the exit, but as the applauding part of the\r\naudience kept pressing forward towards the platform, there was a regular\r\nblock. The ladies screamed, some of the girls began to cry and asked to\r\ngo home.","Lembke, standing up by his chair, kept gazing wildly about him.\r\nYulia Mihailovna completely lost her head--for the first time during her\r\ncareer amongst us. As for Stepan Trofimovitch, for the first moment\r\nhe seemed literally crushed by the divinity student's words, but he\r\nsuddenly raised his arms as though holding them out above the public and\r\nyelled:\r\n\r\n\"I shake the dust from off my feet and I curse you.","... It's the end, the\r\nend....\"\r\n\r\nAnd turning, he ran behind the scenes, waving his hands menacingly.\r\n\r\n\"He has insulted the audience!... Verhovensky!\" the angry section\r\nroared. They even wanted to rush in pursuit of him. It was impossible to\r\nappease them, at the moment, any way, and--a final catastrophe broke\r\nlike a bomb on the assembly and exploded in its midst: the third reader,\r\nthe maniac who kept waving his fist behind the scenes, suddenly ran\r\non to the platform.","He looked like a perfect madman. With a broad,\r\ntriumphant smile, full of boundless self-confidence, he looked round at\r\nthe agitated hall and he seemed to be delighted at the disorder. He was\r\nnot in the least disconcerted at having to speak in such an uproar, on\r\nthe contrary, he was obviously delighted. This was so obvious that it\r\nattracted attention at once.\r\n\r\n\"What's this now?\" people were heard asking.","\"Who is this? Sh-h! What\r\ndoes he want to say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" the maniac shouted with all his might, standing\r\nat the very edge of the platform and speaking with almost as shrill,\r\nfeminine a voice as Karmazinov's, but without the aristocratic lisp.\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen! Twenty years ago, on the eve of war with half\r\nEurope, Russia was regarded as an ideal country by officials of all\r\nranks! Literature was in the service of the censorship; military drill\r\nwas all that was taught at the universities; the troops were trained\r\nlike a ballet, and the peasants paid the taxes and were mute under the\r\nlash of serfdom.","Patriotism meant the wringing of bribes from the quick\r\nand the dead. Those who did not take bribes were looked upon as rebels\r\nbecause they disturbed the general harmony. The birch copses were\r\nextirpated in support of discipline. Europe trembled.... But never in\r\nthe thousand years of its senseless existence had Russia sunk to such\r\nignominy....\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his fist, waved it ecstatically and menacingly over his head\r\nand suddenly brought it down furiously, as though pounding an adversary\r\nto powder.","A frantic yell rose from the whole hall, there was a\r\ndeafening roar of applause; almost half the audience was applauding:\r\ntheir enthusiasm was excusable. Russia was being put to shame publicly,\r\nbefore every one. Who could fail to roar with delight?\r\n\r\n\"This is the real thing! Come, this is something like! Hurrah! Yes, this\r\nis none of your √¶sthetics!\"\r\n\r\nThe maniac went on ecstatically:\r\n\r\n\"Twenty years have passed since then.","Universities have been opened and\r\nmultiplied. Military drill has passed into a legend; officers are too\r\nfew by thousands, the railways have eaten up all the capital and have\r\ncovered Russia as with a spider's web, so that in another fifteen years\r\none will perhaps get somewhere. Bridges are rarely on fire, and fires in\r\ntowns occur only at regular intervals, in turn, at the proper season.\r\nIn the law courts judgments are as wise as Solomon's, and the jury only\r\ntake bribes through the struggle for existence, to escape starvation.","The serfs are free, and flog one another instead of being flogged by\r\nthe land-owners. Seas and oceans of vodka are consumed to support the\r\nbudget, and in Novgorod, opposite the ancient and useless St. Sophia,\r\nthere has been solemnly put up a colossal bronze globe to celebrate a\r\nthousand years of disorder and confusion; Europe scowls and begins to\r\nbe uneasy again.... Fifteen years of reforms! And yet never even in the\r\nmost grotesque periods of its madness has Russia sunk.","..\"\r\n\r\nThe last words could not be heard in the roar of the crowd. One could\r\nsee him again raise his arm and bring it down triumphantly again.\r\nEnthusiasm was beyond all bounds: people yelled, clapped their hands,\r\neven some of the ladies shouted: \"Enough, you can't beat that!\" Some\r\nmight have been drunk. The orator scanned them all and seemed revelling\r\nin his own triumph. I caught a glimpse of Lembke in indescribable\r\nexcitement, pointing something out to somebody.","Yulia Mihailovna, with a\r\npale face, said something in haste to the prince, who had run up to her.\r\nBut at that moment a group of six men, officials more or less, burst on\r\nto the platform, seized the orator and dragged him behind the scenes. I\r\ncan't understand how he managed to tear himself away from them, but he\r\ndid escape, darted up to the edge of the platform again and succeeded in\r\nshouting again, at the top of his voice, waving his fist: \"But never has\r\nRussia sunk.","..\"\r\n\r\nBut he was dragged away again. I saw some fifteen men dash behind the\r\nscenes to rescue him, not crossing the platform but breaking down the\r\nlight screen at the side of it.... I saw afterwards, though I could\r\nhardly believe my eyes, the girl student (Virginsky's sister) leap on\r\nto the platform with the same roll under her arm, dressed as before,\r\nas plump and rosy as ever, surrounded by two or three women and two or\r\nthree men, and accompanied by her mortal enemy, the schoolboy.","I even\r\ncaught the phrase:\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, I've come to call attention to the sufferings\r\nof poor students and to rouse them to a general protest...\"\r\n\r\nBut I ran away. Hiding my badge in my pocket I made my way from the\r\nhouse into the street by back passages which I knew of. First of all, of\r\ncourse, I went to Stepan Trofimovitch's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. THE END OF THE FETE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nHE WOULD NOT SEE ME.","He had shut himself up and was writing. At my\r\nrepeated knocks and appeals he answered through the door:\r\n\r\n\"My friend, I have finished everything. Who can ask anything more of\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't finished anything, you've only helped to make a mess of the\r\nwhole thing. For God's sake, no epigrams, Stepan Trofimovitch! Open the\r\ndoor. We must take steps; they may still come and insult you....\"\r\n\r\nI thought myself entitled to be particularly severe and even rigorous.","I was afraid he might be going to do something still more mad. But to my\r\nsurprise I met an extraordinary firmness.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be the first to insult me then. I thank you for the past, but\r\nI repeat I've done with all men, good and bad. I am writing to Darya\r\nPavlovna, whom I've forgotten so unpardonably till now. You may take it\r\nto her to-morrow, if you like, now _merci_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stepan Trofimovitch, I assure you that the matter is more serious\r\nthan you think.","Do you think that you've crushed someone there? You've\r\npulverised no one, but have broken yourself to pieces like an empty\r\nbottle.\" (Oh, I was coarse and discourteous, I remember it with\r\nregret.) \"You've absolutely no reason to write to Darya Pavlovna... and\r\nwhat will you do with yourself without me? What do you understand about\r\npractical life? I expect you are plotting something else? You'll simply\r\ncome to grief again if you go plotting something more.","...\"\r\n\r\nHe rose and came close up to the door.\r\n\r\n\"You've not been long with them, but you've caught the infection of\r\ntheir tone and language. _Dieu vous pardonne, mon ami, et Dieu vous\r\ngarde._ But I've always seen in you the germs of delicate feeling, and\r\nyou will get over it perhaps--_apr√®s le temps,_ of course, like all of us\r\nRussians. As for what you say about my impracticability, I'll remind you\r\nof a recent idea of mine: a whole mass of people in Russia do nothing\r\nwhatever but attack other people's impracticability with the utmost fury\r\nand with the tiresome persistence of flies in the summer, accusing every\r\none of it except themselves.","_Cher,_ remember that I am excited, and\r\ndon't distress me. Once more _merci_ for everything, and let us part like\r\nKarmazinov and the public; that is, let us forget each other with as\r\nmuch generosity as we can. He was posing in begging his former readers\r\nso earnestly to forget him; _quant √† moi,_ I am not so conceited, and I\r\nrest my hopes on the youth of your inexperienced heart. How should you\r\nremember a useless old man for long? 'Live more,' my friend, as Nastasya\r\nwished me on my last name-day _(ces pauvres gens ont quelquefois des\r\nmots charmants et pleins de philosophie).","_ I do not wish you much\r\nhappiness--it will bore you. I do not wish you trouble either, but,\r\nfollowing the philosophy of the peasant, I will repeat simply 'live\r\nmore' and try not to be much bored; this useless wish I add from myself.\r\nWell, good-bye, and good-bye for good. Don't stand at my door, I will\r\nnot open it.\"\r\n\r\nHe went away and I could get nothing more out of him. In spite of his\r\n\"excitement,\" he spoke smoothly, deliberately, with weight, obviously\r\ntrying to be impressive.","Of course he was rather vexed with me and was\r\navenging himself indirectly, possibly even for the yesterday's \"prison\r\ncarts\" and \"floors that give way.\" His tears in public that morning, in\r\nspite of a triumph of a sort, had put him, he knew, in rather a comic\r\nposition, and there never was a man more solicitous of dignity and\r\npunctilio in his relations with his friends than Stepan Trofimovitch.","Oh, I don't blame him. But this fastidiousness and irony which he\r\npreserved in spite of all shocks reassured me at the time. A man who was\r\nso little different from his ordinary self was, of course, not in the\r\nmood at that moment for anything tragic or extraordinary. So I reasoned\r\nat the time, and, heavens, what a mistake I made! I left too much out of\r\nmy reckoning.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of events I will quote the few first lines of the letter\r\nto Darya Pavlovna, which she actually received the following day:\r\n\r\n\"_Mon enfant,_ my hand trembles, but I've done with everything.","You were\r\nnot present at my last struggle: you did not come to that matin√©e, and\r\nyou did well to stay away. But you will be told that in our Russia,\r\nwhich has grown so poor in men of character, one man had the courage to\r\nstand up and, in spite of deadly menaces showered on him from all\r\nsides, to tell the fools the truth, that is, that they are fools. _Oh,\r\nce sont--des pauvres petits vauriens et rien de plus, des\r\npetits_--fools--_voil√† le mot!_ The die is cast; I am going from this town\r\nforever and I know not whither.","Every one I loved has turned from me.\r\nBut you, you are a pure and na√Øve creature; you, a gentle being whose\r\nlife has been all but linked with mine at the will of a capricious and\r\nimperious heart; you who looked at me perhaps with contempt when I shed\r\nweak tears on the eve of our frustrated marriage; you, who cannot in any\r\ncase look on me except as a comic figure--for you, for you is the last\r\ncry of my heart, for you my last duty, for you alone! I cannot leave\r\nyou forever thinking of me as an ungrateful fool, a churlish egoist, as\r\nprobably a cruel and ungrateful heart--whom, alas, I cannot forget--is\r\nevery day describing me to you.","...\"\r\n\r\nAnd so on and so on, four large pages.\r\n\r\nAnswering his \"I won't open\" with three bangs with my fist on the door,\r\nand shouting after him that I was sure he would send Nastasya for me\r\nthree times that day, but I would not come, I gave him up and ran off to\r\nYulia Mihailovna.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThere I was the witness of a revolting scene: the poor woman was\r\ndeceived to her face, and I could do nothing.","Indeed, what could I say\r\nto her? I had had time to reconsider things a little and reflect that\r\nI had nothing to go upon but certain feelings and suspicious\r\npresentiments. I found her in tears, almost in hysterics, with\r\ncompresses of eau-de-Cologne and a glass of water. Before her stood\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch, who talked without stopping, and the prince, who\r\nheld his tongue as though it had been under a lock.","With tears and\r\nlamentations she reproached Pyotr Stepanovitch for his \"desertion.\" I\r\nwas struck at once by the fact that she ascribed the whole failure,\r\nthe whole ignominy of the matin√©e, everything in fact, to Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch's absence.\r\n\r\nIn him I observed an important change: he seemed a shade too anxious,\r\nalmost serious. As a rule he never seemed serious; he was always\r\nlaughing, even when he was angry, and he was often angry.","Oh, he was\r\nangry now! He was speaking coarsely, carelessly, with vexation and\r\nimpatience. He said that he had been taken ill at Gaganov's lodging,\r\nwhere he had happened to go early in the morning. Alas, the poor woman\r\nwas so anxious to be deceived again! The chief question which I found\r\nbeing discussed was whether the ball, that is, the whole second half of\r\nthe f√™te, should or should not take place.","Yulia Mihailovna could not be\r\ninduced to appear at the ball \"after the insults she had received that\r\nmorning\"; in other words, her heart was set on being compelled to do so,\r\nand by him, by Pyotr Stepanovitch. She looked upon him as an oracle, and\r\nI believe if he had gone away she would have taken to her bed at once.\r\nBut he did not want to go away; he was desperately anxious that the ball\r\nshould take place and that Yulia Mihailovna should be present at it.","\"Come, what is there to cry about? Are you set on having a scene? On\r\nventing your anger on somebody? Well, vent it on me; only make haste\r\nabout it, for the time is passing and you must make up your mind. We\r\nmade a mess of it with the matin√©e; we'll pick up on the ball. Here, the\r\nprince thinks as I do. Yes, if it hadn't been for the prince, how would\r\nthings have ended there?\"\r\n\r\nThe prince had been at first opposed to the ball (that is, opposed to\r\nYulia Mihailovna's appearing at it; the ball was bound to go on in any\r\ncase), but after two or three such references to his opinion he began\r\nlittle by little to grunt his acquiescence.","I was surprised too at the extraordinary rudeness of Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch's tone. Oh, I scout with indignation the contemptible\r\nslander which was spread later of some supposed liaison between Yulia\r\nMihailovna and Pyotr Stepanovitch. There was no such thing, nor could\r\nthere be. He gained his ascendency over her from the first only by\r\nencouraging her in her dreams of influence in society and in the\r\nministry, by entering into her plans, by inventing them for her, and\r\nworking upon her with the grossest flattery.","He had got her completely\r\ninto his toils and had become as necessary to her as the air she\r\nbreathed. Seeing me, she cried, with flashing eyes:\r\n\r\n\"Here, ask him. He kept by my side all the while, just like the prince\r\ndid. Tell me, isn't it plain that it was all a preconcerted plot, a\r\nbase, designing plot to damage Andrey Antonovitch and me as much as\r\npossible? Oh, they had arranged it beforehand.","They had a plan! It's a\r\nparty, a regular party.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are exaggerating as usual. You've always some romantic notion in\r\nyour head. But I am glad to see Mr....\" (He pretended to have forgotten\r\nmy name.) \"He'll give us his opinion.\"\r\n\r\n\"My opinion,\" I hastened to put in, \"is the same as Yulia Mihailovna's.\r\nThe plot is only too evident. I have brought you these ribbons, Yulia\r\nMihailovna. Whether the ball is to take place or not is not my business,\r\nfor it's not in my power to decide; but my part as steward is over.","Forgive my warmth, but I can't act against the dictates of common sense\r\nand my own convictions.\"\r\n\r\n\"You hear! You hear!\" She clasped her hands.\r\n\r\n\"I hear, and I tell you this.\" He turned to me. \"I think you must\r\nhave eaten something which has made you all delirious. To my thinking,\r\nnothing has happened, absolutely nothing but what has happened before\r\nand is always liable to happen in this town.","A plot, indeed! It was an\r\nugly failure, disgracefully stupid. But where's the plot? A plot against\r\nYulia Mihailovna, who has spoiled them and protected them and fondly\r\nforgiven them all their schoolboy pranks! Yulia Mihailovna! What have I\r\nbeen hammering into you for the last month continually? What did I warn\r\nyou? What did you want with all these people--what did you want with\r\nthem? What induced you to mix yourself up with these fellows? What was\r\nthe motive, what was the object of it? To unite society? But, mercy on\r\nus! will they ever be united?\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you warn me? On the contrary, you approved of it, you even\r\ninsisted on it.","... I confess I am so surprised.... You brought all sorts\r\nof strange people to see me yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, I opposed you; I did not approve of it. As for\r\nbringing them to see you, I certainly did, but only after they'd got\r\nin by dozens and only of late to make up 'the literary quadrille'--we\r\ncouldn't get on without these rogues. Only I don't mind betting that a\r\ndozen or two more of the same sort were let in without tickets to-day.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a doubt of it,\" I agreed.\r\n\r\n\"There, you see, you are agreeing already. Think what the tone has been\r\nlately here--I mean in this wretched town. It's nothing but insolence,\r\nimpudence; it's been a crying scandal all the time. And who's been\r\nencouraging it? Who's screened it by her authority? Who's upset them\r\nall? Who has made all the small fry huffy? All their family secrets are\r\ncaricatured in your album.","Didn't you pat them on the back, your poets\r\nand caricaturists? Didn't you let Lyamshin kiss your hand? Didn't a\r\ndivinity student abuse an actual state councillor in your presence and\r\nspoil his daughter's dress with his tarred boots? Now, can you wonder\r\nthat the public is set against you?\"\r\n\r\n\"But that's all your doing, yours! Oh, my goodness!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I warned you. We quarrelled. Do you hear, we quarrelled?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you are lying to my face!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it's easy for you to say that.","You need a victim to vent your\r\nwrath on. Well, vent it on me as I've said already. I'd better appeal to\r\nyou, Mr....\" (He was still unable to recall my name.) \"We'll reckon\r\non our fingers. I maintain that, apart from Liputin, there was nothing\r\npreconcerted, nothing! I will prove it, but first let us analyse\r\nLiputin. He came forward with that fool Lebyadkin's verses. Do you\r\nmaintain that that was a plot? But do you know it might simply have\r\nstruck Liputin as a clever thing to do.","Seriously, seriously. He simply\r\ncame forward with the idea of making every one laugh and entertaining\r\nthem--his protectress Yulia Mihailovna first of all. That was all. Don't\r\nyou believe it? Isn't that in keeping with all that has been going\r\non here for the last month? Do you want me to tell the whole truth? I\r\ndeclare that under other circumstances it might have gone off all right.\r\nIt was a coarse joke--well, a bit strong, perhaps; but it was amusing,\r\nyou know, wasn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What! You think what Liputin did was clever?\" Yulia Mihailovna cried\r\nin intense indignation.","\"Such stupidity, such tactlessness, so\r\ncontemptible, so mean! It was intentional! Oh, you are saying it on\r\npurpose! I believe after that you are in the plot with them yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I was behind the scenes, I was in hiding, I set it all going.\r\nBut if I were in the plot--understand that, anyway--it wouldn't have\r\nended with Liputin. So according to you I had arranged with my papa too\r\nthat he should cause such a scene on purpose? Well, whose fault is it\r\nthat my papa was allowed to read? Who tried only yesterday to prevent\r\nyou from allowing it, only yesterday?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Oh, hier il avait tant d'esprit,_ I was so reckoning on him; and then he\r\nhas such manners.","I thought with him and Karmazinov... Only think!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, only think. But in spite of _tant d'esprit_ papa has made things\r\nworse, and if I'd known beforehand that he'd make such a mess of it, I\r\nshould certainly not have persuaded you yesterday to keep the goat\r\nout of the kitchen garden, should I--since I am taking part in this\r\nconspiracy against your f√™te that you are so positive about? And yet I\r\ndid try to dissuade you yesterday; I tried to because I foresaw it.","To\r\nforesee everything was, of course, impossible; he probably did not know\r\nhimself a minute before what he would fire off--these nervous old men\r\ncan't be reckoned on like other people. But you can still save\r\nthe situation: to satisfy the public, send to him to-morrow by\r\nadministrative order, and with all the ceremonies, two doctors to\r\ninquire into his health. Even to-day, in fact, and take him straight to\r\nthe hospital and apply cold compresses.","Every one would laugh, anyway,\r\nand see that there was nothing to take offence at. I'll tell people\r\nabout it in the evening at the ball, as I am his son. Karmazinov is\r\nanother story. He was a perfect ass and dragged out his article for a\r\nwhole hour. He certainly must have been in the plot with me! 'I'll make\r\na mess of it too,' he thought, 'to damage Yulia Mihailovna.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Karmazinov! _Quelle honte!_ I was burning, burning with shame for his\r\naudience!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I shouldn't have burnt, but have cooked him instead.","The audience\r\nwas right, you know. Who was to blame for Karmazinov, again? Did I foist\r\nhim upon you? Was I one of his worshippers? Well, hang him! But the\r\nthird maniac, the political--that's a different matter. That was every\r\none's blunder, not only my plot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, don't speak of it! That was awful, awful! That was my fault,\r\nentirely my fault!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it was, but I don't blame you for that.","No one can control\r\nthem, these candid souls! You can't always be safe from them, even in\r\nPetersburg. He was recommended to you, and in what terms too! So you\r\nwill admit that you are bound to appear at the ball to-night. It's an\r\nimportant business. It was you put him on to the platform. You must make\r\nit plain now to the public that you are not in league with him, that\r\nthe fellow is in the hands of the police, and that you were in some\r\ninexplicable way deceived.","You ought to declare with indignation that\r\nyou were the victim of a madman. Because he is a madman and nothing\r\nmore. That's how you must put it about him. I can't endure these people\r\nwho bite. I say worse things perhaps, but not from the platform, you\r\nknow. And they are talking about a senator too.\"\r\n\r\n\"What senator? Who's talking?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand it myself, you know. Do you know anything about a\r\nsenator, Yulia Mihailovna?\"\r\n\r\n\"A senator?\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, they are convinced that a senator has been appointed to be\r\ngovernor here, and that you are being superseded from Petersburg.","I've\r\nheard it from lots of people.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've heard it too,\" I put in.\r\n\r\n\"Who said so?\" asked Yulia Mihailovna, flushing all over.\r\n\r\n\"You mean, who said so first? How can I tell? But there it is, people\r\nsay so. Masses of people are saying so. They were saying so yesterday\r\nparticularly. They are all very serious about it, though I can't make it\r\nout. Of course the more intelligent and competent don't talk, but even\r\nsome of those listen.","\"\r\n\r\n\"How mean! And... how stupid!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's just why you must make your appearance, to show these\r\nfools.\"\r\n\r\n\"I confess I feel myself that it's my duty, but... what if there's\r\nanother disgrace in store for us? What if people don't come? No one will\r\ncome, you know, no one!\"\r\n\r\n\"How hot you are! They not come! What about the new clothes? What about\r\nthe girls' dresses? I give you up as a woman after that! Is that your\r\nknowledge of human nature?\"\r\n\r\n\"The marshal's wife won't come, she won't.","\"\r\n\r\n\"But, after all, what has happened? Why won't they come?\" he cried at\r\nlast with angry impatience.\r\n\r\n\"Ignominy, disgrace--that's what's happened. I don't know what to call\r\nit, but after it I can't face people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? How are you to blame for it, after all? Why do you take the blame\r\nof it on yourself? Isn't it rather the fault of the audience, of\r\nyour respectable residents, your patresfamilias? They ought to have\r\ncontrolled the roughs and the rowdies--for it was all the work of roughs\r\nand rowdies, nothing serious.","You can never manage things with the\r\npolice alone in any society, anywhere. Among us every one asks for\r\na special policeman to protect him wherever he goes. People don't\r\nunderstand that society must protect itself. And what do our\r\npatresfamilias, the officials, the wives and daughters, do in such\r\ncases? They sit quiet and sulk. In fact there's not enough social\r\ninitiative to keep the disorderly in check.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that's the simple truth! They sit quiet, sulk and... gaze about\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if it's the truth, you ought to say so aloud, proudly, sternly,\r\njust to show that you are not defeated, to those respectable residents\r\nand mothers of families. Oh, you can do it; you have the gift when your\r\nhead is clear. You will gather them round you and say it aloud. And\r\nthen a paragraph in the _Voice_ and the _Financial News.","_ Wait a bit, I'll\r\nundertake it myself, I'll arrange it all for you. Of course there must\r\nbe more superintendence: you must look after the buffet; you must ask\r\nthe prince, you must ask Mr.... You must not desert us, monsieur, just\r\nwhen we have to begin all over again. And finally, you must appear\r\narm-in-arm with Andrey Antonovitch.... How is Andrey Antonovitch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how unjustly, how untruly, how cruelly you have always judged that\r\nangelic man!\" Yulia Mihailovna cried in a sudden, outburst, almost with\r\ntears, putting her handkerchief to her eyes.","Pyotr Stepanovitch was positively taken aback for the moment. \"Good\r\nheavens! I.... What have I said? I've always...\"\r\n\r\n\"You never have, never! You have never done him justice.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no understanding a woman,\" grumbled Pyotr Stepanovitch, with a\r\nwry smile.\r\n\r\n\"He is the most sincere, the most delicate, the most angelic of men! The\r\nmost kind-hearted of men!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, really, as for kind-heartedness.",".. I've always done him\r\njustice....\"\r\n\r\n\"Never! But let us drop it. I am too awkward in my defence of him.\r\nThis morning that little Jesuit, the marshal's wife, also dropped some\r\nsarcastic hints about what happened yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she has no thoughts to spare for yesterday now, she is full of\r\nto-day. And why are you so upset at her not coming to the ball to-night?\r\nOf course, she won't come after getting mixed up in such a scandal.","Perhaps it's not her fault, but still her reputation... her hands are\r\nsoiled.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean; I don't understand? Why are her hands soiled?\" Yulia\r\nMihailovna looked at him in perplexity.\r\n\r\n\"I don't vouch for the truth of it, but the town is ringing with the\r\nstory that it was she brought them together.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean? Brought whom together?\"\r\n\r\n\"What, do you mean to say you don't know?\" he exclaimed with\r\nwell-simulated wonder.","\"Why Stavrogin and Lizaveta Nikolaevna.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? How?\" we all cried out at once.\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible you don't know? Phew! Why, it is quite a tragic romance:\r\nLizaveta Nikolaevna was pleased to get out of that lady's carriage\r\nand get straight into Stavrogin's carriage, and slipped off with 'the\r\nlatter' to Skvoreshniki in full daylight. Only an hour ago, hardly an\r\nhour.\"\r\n\r\nWe were flabbergasted.","Of course we fell to questioning him, but to our\r\nwonder, although he \"happened\" to be a witness of the scene himself,\r\nhe could give us no detailed account of it. The thing seemed to have\r\nhappened like this: when the marshal's wife was driving Liza and Mavriky\r\nNikolaevitch from the matin√©e to the house of Praskovya Ivanovna (whose\r\nlegs were still bad) they saw a carriage waiting a short distance, about\r\ntwenty-five paces, to one side of the front door.","When Liza jumped out,\r\nshe ran straight to this carriage; the door was flung open and shut\r\nagain; Liza called to Mavriky Nikolaevitch, \"Spare me,\" and the carriage\r\ndrove off at full speed to Skvoreshniki. To our hurried questions\r\nwhether it was by arrangement? Who was in the carriage? Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch answered that he knew nothing about it; no doubt it had\r\nbeen arranged, but that he did not see Stavrogin himself; possibly the\r\nold butler, Alexey Yegorytch, might have been in the carriage.","To the\r\nquestion \"How did he come to be there, and how did he know for a fact\r\nthat she had driven to Skvoreshniki?\" he answered that he happened to be\r\npassing and, at seeing Liza, he had run up to the carriage (and yet he\r\ncould not make out who was in it, an inquisitive man like him!) and\r\nthat Mavriky Nikolaevitch, far from setting off in pursuit, had not\r\neven tried to stop Liza, and had even laid a restraining hand on the\r\nmarshal's wife, who was shouting at the top of her voice: \"She is going\r\nto Stavrogin, to Stavrogin.","\" At this point I lost patience, and cried\r\nfuriously to Pyotr Stepanovitch:\r\n\r\n\"It's all your doing, you rascal! This was what you were doing this\r\nmorning. You helped Stavrogin, you came in the carriage, you helped her\r\ninto it... it was you, you, you! Yulia Mihailovna, he is your enemy; he\r\nwill be your ruin too! Beware of him!\"\r\n\r\nAnd I ran headlong out of the house. I wonder myself and cannot make out\r\nto this day how I came to say that to him.","But I guessed quite right:\r\nit had all happened almost exactly as I said, as appeared later. What\r\nstruck me most was the obviously artificial way in which he broke\r\nthe news. He had not told it at once on entering the house as an\r\nextraordinary piece of news, but pretended that we knew without his\r\ntelling us which was impossible in so short a time. And if we had known\r\nit, we could not possibly have refrained from mentioning it till he\r\nintroduced the subject.","Besides, he could not have heard yet that the\r\ntown was \"ringing with gossip\" about the marshal's wife in so short a\r\ntime. Besides, he had once or twice given a vulgar, frivolous smile\r\nas he told the story, probably considering that we were fools and\r\ncompletely taken in.\r\n\r\nBut I had no thought to spare for him; the central fact I believed, and\r\nran from Yulia Mihailovna's, beside myself. The catastrophe cut me\r\nto the heart.","I was wounded almost to tears; perhaps I did shed\r\nsome indeed. I was at a complete loss what to do. I rushed to Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch's, but the vexatious man still refused to open the door.\r\nNastasya informed me, in a reverent whisper, that he had gone to bed,\r\nbut I did not believe it. At Liza's house I succeeded in questioning the\r\nservants. They confirmed the story of the elopement, but knew nothing\r\nthemselves.","There was great commotion in the house; their mistress had\r\nbeen attacked by fainting fits, and Mavriky Nikolaevitch was with her.\r\nI did not feel it possible to ask for Mavriky Nikolaevitch. To my\r\ninquiries about Pyotr Stepanovitch they told me that he had been in and\r\nout continually of late, sometimes twice in the day. The servants were\r\nsad, and showed particular respectfulness in speaking of Liza; they were\r\nfond of her.","That she was ruined, utterly ruined, I did not doubt;\r\nbut the psychological aspect of the matter I was utterly unable to\r\nunderstand, especially after her scene with Stavrogin the previous day.\r\nTo run about the town and inquire at the houses of acquaintances, who\r\nwould, of course, by now have heard the news and be rejoicing at it,\r\nseemed to me revolting, besides being humiliating for Liza. But, strange\r\nto say, I ran to see Darya Pavlovna, though I was not admitted (no one\r\nhad been admitted into the house since the previous morning).","I don't\r\nknow what I could have said to her and what made me run to her. From her\r\nI went to her brother's. Shatov listened sullenly and in silence. I may\r\nobserve that I found him more gloomy than I had ever seen him before; he\r\nwas awfully preoccupied and seemed only to listen to me with an effort.\r\nHe said scarcely anything and began walking up and down his cell from\r\ncorner to corner, treading more noisily than usual.","As I was going down\r\nthe stairs he shouted after me to go to Liputin's: \"There you'll hear\r\neverything.\" Yet I did not go to Liputin's, but after I'd gone a good\r\nway towards home I turned back to Shatov's again, and, half opening the\r\ndoor without going in, suggested to him laconically and with no kind of\r\nexplanation, \"Won't you go to Marya Timofyevna to-day?\" At this Shatov\r\nswore at me, and I went away.","I note here that I may not forget it that\r\nhe did purposely go that evening to the other end of the town to see\r\nMarya Timofyevna, whom he had not seen for some time. He found her in\r\nexcellent health and spirits and Lebyadkin dead drunk, asleep on the\r\nsofa in the first room. This was at nine o'clock. He told me so himself\r\nnext day when we met for a moment in the street. Before ten o'clock I\r\nmade up my mind to go to the ball, but not in the capacity of a steward\r\n(besides my rosette had been left at Yulia Mihailovna's).","I was tempted\r\nby irresistible curiosity to listen, without asking any questions,\r\nto what people were saying in the town about all that had happened. I\r\nwanted, too, to have a look at Yulia Mihailovna, if only at a distance.\r\nI reproached myself greatly that I had left her so abruptly that\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAll that night, with its almost grotesque incidents, and the terrible\r\n_d√©nouement_ that followed in the early morning, still seems to me like a\r\nhideous nightmare, and is, for me at least, the most painful chapter\r\nin my chronicle.","I was late for the ball, and it was destined to end\r\nso quickly that I arrived not long before it was over. It was eleven\r\no'clock when I reached the entrance of the marshal's house, where the\r\nsame White Hall in which the matin√©e had taken place had, in spite of\r\nthe short interval between, been cleared and made ready to serve as the\r\nchief ballroom for the whole town, as we expected, to dance in.","But far\r\nas I had been that morning from expecting the ball to be a success, I\r\nhad had no presentiment of the full truth. Not one family of the\r\nhigher circles appeared; even the subordinate officials of rather more\r\nconsequence were absent--and this was a very striking fact. As for\r\nladies and girls, Pyotr Stepanovitch's arguments (the duplicity of which\r\nwas obvious now) turned out to be utterly incorrect: exceedingly few\r\nhad come; to four men there was scarcely one lady--and what ladies\r\nthey were! Regimental ladies of a sort, three doctors' wives with\r\ntheir daughters, two or three poor ladies from the country, the seven\r\ndaughters and the niece of the secretary whom I have mentioned already,\r\nsome wives of tradesmen, of post-office clerks and other small fry--was\r\nthis what Yulia Mihailovna expected? Half the tradespeople even were\r\nabsent.","As for the men, in spite of the complete absence of all persons\r\nof consequence, there was still a crowd of them, but they made a\r\ndoubtful and suspicious impression. There were, of course, some quiet\r\nand respectful officers with their wives, some of the most docile\r\nfathers of families, like that secretary, for instance, the father of\r\nhis seven daughters. All these humble, insignificant people had come, as\r\none of these gentlemen expressed it, because it was \"inevitable.","\" But,\r\non the other hand, the mass of free-and-easy people and the mass too of\r\nthose whom Pyotr Stepanovitch and I had suspected of coming in without\r\ntickets, seemed even bigger than in the afternoon. So far they were all\r\nsitting in the refreshment bar, and had gone straight there on arriving,\r\nas though it were the meeting-place they had agreed upon. So at least it\r\nseemed to me. The refreshment bar had been placed in a large room,\r\nthe last of several opening out of one another.","Here Prohoritch was\r\ninstalled with all the attractions of the club cuisine and with a\r\ntempting display of drinks and dainties. I noticed several persons whose\r\ncoats were almost in rags and whose get-up was altogether suspicious and\r\nutterly unsuitable for a ball. They had evidently been with great pains\r\nbrought to a state of partial sobriety which would not last long; and\r\ngoodness knows where they had been brought from, they were not local\r\npeople.","I knew, of course, that it was part of Yulia Mihailovna's idea\r\nthat the ball should be of the most democratic character, and that \"even\r\nworking people and shopmen should not be excluded if any one of that\r\nclass chanced to pay for a ticket.\" She could bravely utter such words\r\nin her committee with absolute security that none of the working people\r\nof our town, who all lived in extreme poverty, would dream of taking a\r\nticket.","But in spite of the democratic sentiments of the committee, I\r\ncould hardly believe that such sinister-looking and shabby people could\r\nhave been admitted in the regular way. But who could have admitted them,\r\nand with what object? Lyamshin and Liputin had already been deprived of\r\ntheir steward's rosettes, though they were present at the ball, as they\r\nwere taking part in the \"literary quadrille.","\" But, to my amazement,\r\nLiputin's place was taken by the divinity student, who had caused\r\nthe greatest scandal at the matin√©e by his skirmish with Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch; and Lyamshin's was taken by Pyotr Stepanovitch himself.\r\nWhat was to be looked for under the circumstances?\r\n\r\nI tried to listen to the conversation. I was struck by the wildness\r\nof some ideas I heard expressed. It was maintained in one group, for\r\ninstance, that Yulia Mihailovna had arranged Liza's elopement with\r\nStavrogin and had been paid by the latter for doing so.","Even the sum\r\npaid was mentioned. It was asserted that she had arranged the whole f√™te\r\nwith a view to it, and that that was the reason why half the town had\r\nnot turned up at the ball, and that Lembke himself was so upset about it\r\nthat \"his mind had given way,\" and that, crazy as he was, \"she had got\r\nhim in tow.\" There was a great deal of laughter too, hoarse, wild\r\nand significant. Every one was criticising the ball, too, with great\r\nseverity, and abusing Yulia Mihailovna without ceremony.","In fact it was\r\ndisorderly, incoherent, drunken and excited babble, so it was difficult\r\nto put it together and make anything of it. At the same time there were\r\nsimple-hearted people enjoying themselves at the refreshment-bar; there\r\nwere even some ladies of the sort who are surprised and frightened at\r\nnothing, very genial and festive, chiefly military ladies with their\r\nhusbands. They made parties at the little tables, were drinking tea, and\r\nwere very merry.","The refreshment-bar made a snug refuge for almost half\r\nof the guests. Yet in a little time all this mass of people must stream\r\ninto the ballroom. It was horrible to think of it!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the prince had succeeded in arranging three skimpy quadrilles\r\nin the White Hall. The young ladies were dancing, while their parents\r\nwere enjoying watching them. But many of these respectable persons had\r\nalready begun to think how they could, after giving their girls a treat,\r\nget off in good time before \"the trouble began.","\" Absolutely every one\r\nwas convinced that it certainly would begin. It would be difficult for\r\nme to describe Yulia Mihailovna's state of mind. I did not talk to her\r\nthough I went close up to her. She did not respond to the bow I made her\r\non entering; she did not notice me (really did not notice). There was a\r\npainful look in her face and a contemptuous and haughty though restless\r\nand agitated expression in her eyes.","She controlled herself with evident\r\nsuffering--for whose sake, with what object? She certainly ought to have\r\ngone away, still more to have got her husband away, and she remained!\r\nFrom her face one could see that her eyes were \"fully opened,\" and\r\nthat it was useless for her to expect any thing more. She did not even\r\nsummon Pyotr Stepanovitch (he seemed to avoid her; I saw him in the\r\nrefreshment-room, he was extremely lively).","But she remained at the ball\r\nand did not let Andrey Antonovitch leave her side for a moment. Oh, up\r\nto the very last moment, even that morning she would have repudiated any\r\nhint about his health with genuine indignation. But now her eyes were\r\nto be opened on this subject too. As for me, I thought from the first\r\nglance that Andrey Antonovitch looked worse than he had done in the\r\nmorning. He seemed to be plunged into a sort of oblivion and hardly\r\nto know where he was.","Sometimes he looked about him with unexpected\r\nseverity--at me, for instance, twice. Once he tried to say something;\r\nhe began loudly and audibly but did not finish the sentence, throwing\r\na modest old clerk who happened to be near him almost into a panic. But\r\neven this humble section of the assembly held sullenly and timidly\r\naloof from Yulia Mihailovna and at the same time turned upon her husband\r\nexceedingly strange glances, open and staring, quite out of keeping with\r\ntheir habitually submissive demeanour.","\"Yes, that struck me, and I suddenly began to guess about Andrey\r\nAntonovitch,\" Yulia Mihailovna confessed to me afterwards.\r\n\r\nYes, she was to blame again! Probably when after my departure she had\r\nsettled with Pyotr Stepanovitch that there should be a ball and that\r\nshe should be present she must have gone again to the study where Andrey\r\nAntonovitch was sitting, utterly \"shattered\" by the matin√©e; must again\r\nhave used all her fascinations to persuade him to come with her.","But\r\nwhat misery she must have been in now! And yet she did not go away.\r\nWhether it was pride or simply she lost her head, I do not know. In\r\nspite of her haughtiness, she attempted with smiles and humiliation\r\nto enter into conversation with some ladies, but they were confused,\r\nconfined themselves to distrustful monosyllables, \"Yes\" and \"No,\" and\r\nevidently avoided her.\r\n\r\nThe only person of undoubted consequence who was present at the ball was\r\nthat distinguished general whom I have described already, the one who\r\nafter Stavrogin's duel with Gaganov opened the door to public impatience\r\nat the marshal's wife's.","He walked with an air of dignity through the\r\nrooms, looked about, and listened, and tried to appear as though he had\r\ncome rather for the sake of observation than for the sake of enjoying\r\nhimself.... He ended by establishing himself beside Yulia Mihailovna\r\nand not moving a step away from her, evidently trying to keep up her\r\nspirits, and reassure her. He certainly was a most kind-hearted man,\r\nof very high rank, and so old that even compassion from him was not\r\nwounding.","But to admit to herself that this old gossip was venturing to\r\npity her and almost to protect her, knowing that he was doing her honour\r\nby his presence, was very vexatious. The general stayed by her and never\r\nceased chattering.\r\n\r\n\"They say a town can't go on without seven righteous men... seven, I\r\nthink it is, I am not sure of the number fixed.... I don't know how many\r\nof these seven, the certified righteous of the town.",".. have the honour\r\nof being present at your ball. Yet in spite of their presence I begin\r\nto feel unsafe. _Vous me pardonnez, charmante dame, n'est-ce pas?_ I speak\r\nallegorically, but I went into the refreshment-room and I am glad I\r\nescaped alive.... Our priceless Prohoritch is not in his place there,\r\nand I believe his bar will be destroyed before morning. But I am\r\nlaughing. I am only waiting to see what the 'literary quadrille' is\r\ngoing to be like, and then home to bed.","You must excuse a gouty old\r\nfellow. I go early to bed, and I would advise you too to go 'by-by,' as\r\nthey say _aux enfants._ I've come, you know, to have a look at the pretty\r\ngirls... whom, of course, I could meet nowhere in such profusion as\r\nhere. They all live beyond the river and I don't drive out so far.\r\nThere's a wife of an officer... in the chasseurs I believe he is...\r\nwho is distinctly pretty, distinctly, and.",".. she knows it herself. I've\r\ntalked to the sly puss; she is a sprightly one... and the girls too are\r\nfresh-looking; but that's all, there's nothing but freshness. Still,\r\nit's a pleasure to look at them. There are some rosebuds, but their\r\nlips are thick. As a rule there's an irregularity about female beauty\r\nin Russia, and... they are a little like buns.... _vous me pardonnez,\r\nn'est-ce pas?_..",". with good eyes, however, laughing eyes.... These\r\nrose buds are charming for two years when they are young... even for\r\nthree... then they broaden out and are spoilt forever... producing\r\nin their husbands that deplorable indifference which does so much to\r\npromote the woman movement... that is, if I understand it correctly....\r\nH'm! It's a fine hall; the rooms are not badly decorated. It might be\r\nworse.","The music might be much worse.... I don't say it ought to have\r\nbeen. What makes a bad impression is that there are so few ladies. I say\r\nnothing about the dresses. It's bad that that chap in the grey trousers\r\nshould dare to dance the cancan so openly. I can forgive him if he does\r\nit in the gaiety of his heart, and since he is the local chemist....\r\nStill, eleven o'clock is a bit early even for chemists.","There were two\r\nfellows fighting in the refreshment-bar and they weren't turned out. At\r\neleven o'clock people ought to be turned out for fighting, whatever the\r\nstandard of manners.... Three o'clock is a different matter; then one\r\nhas to make concessions to public opinion--if only this ball survives\r\ntill three o'clock. Varvara Petrovna has not kept her word, though, and\r\nhasn't sent flowers. H'm! She has no thoughts for flowers, _pauvre m√®re!_\r\nAnd poor Liza! Have you heard? They say it's a mysterious story.","..\r\nand Stavrogin is to the front again.... H'm! I would have gone home\r\nto bed... I can hardly keep my eyes open. But when is this 'literary\r\nquadrille' coming on?\"\r\n\r\nAt last the \"literary quadrille\" began. Whenever of late there had been\r\nconversation in the town on the ball it had invariably turned on this\r\nliterary quadrille, and as no one could imagine what it would be like,\r\nit aroused extraordinary curiosity.","Nothing could be more unfavourable\r\nto its chance of success, and great was the disappointment.\r\n\r\nThe side doors of the White Hall were thrown open and several masked\r\nfigures appeared. The public surrounded them eagerly. All the occupants\r\nof the refreshment-bar trooped to the last man into the hall. The masked\r\nfigures took their places for the dance. I succeeded in making my way to\r\nthe front and installed myself just behind Yulia Mihailovna, Von Lembke,\r\nand the general.","At this point Pyotr Stepanovitch, who had kept away\r\ntill that time, skipped up to Yulia Mihailovna.\r\n\r\n\"I've been in the refreshment-room all this time, watching,\" he\r\nwhispered, with the air of a guilty schoolboy, which he, however,\r\nassumed on purpose to irritate her even more. She turned crimson with\r\nanger.\r\n\r\n\"You might give up trying to deceive me now at least, insolent man!\"\r\nbroke from her almost aloud, so that it was heard by other people.","Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch skipped away extremely well satisfied with himself.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to imagine a more pitiful, vulgar, dull and\r\ninsipid allegory than this \"literary quadrille.\" Nothing could be\r\nimagined less appropriate to our local society. Yet they say it was\r\nKarmazinov's idea. It was Liputin indeed who arranged it with the help\r\nof the lame teacher who had been at the meeting at Virginsky's.","But\r\nKarmazinov had given the idea and had, it was said, meant to dress up\r\nand to take a special and prominent part in it. The quadrille was\r\nmade up of six couples of masked figures, who were not in fancy dress\r\nexactly, for their clothes were like every one else's. Thus, for\r\ninstance, one short and elderly gentleman wearing a dress-coat--in fact,\r\ndressed like every one else--wore a venerable grey beard, tied on (and this\r\nconstituted his disguise).","As he danced he pounded up and down, taking\r\ntiny and rapid steps on the same spot with a stolid expression of\r\ncountenance. He gave vent to sounds in a subdued but husky bass, and\r\nthis huskiness was meant to suggest one of the well-known papers.\r\nOpposite this figure danced two giants, X and Z, and these letters were\r\npinned on their coats, but what the letters meant remained unexplained.\r\n\"Honest Russian thought\" was represented by a middle-aged gentleman in\r\nspectacles, dress-coat and gloves, and wearing fetters (real fetters).","Under his arm he had a portfolio containing papers relating to some\r\n\"case.\" To convince the sceptical, a letter from abroad testifying to\r\nthe honesty of \"honest Russian thought\" peeped out of his pocket. All\r\nthis was explained by the stewards, as the letter which peeped out of\r\nhis pocket could not be read. \"Honest Russian thought\" had his right\r\nhand raised and in it held a glass as though he wanted to propose a\r\ntoast.","In a line with him on each side tripped a crop-headed Nihilist\r\ngirl; while _vis-√†-vis_ danced another elderly gentleman in a dress-coat\r\nwith a heavy cudgel in his hand. He was meant to represent a formidable\r\nperiodical (not a Petersburg one), and seemed to be saying, \"I'll\r\npound you to a jelly.\" But in spite of his cudgel he could not bear the\r\nspectacles of \"honest Russian thought\" fixed upon him and tried to look\r\naway, and when he did the _pas de deux,_ he twisted, turned, and did not\r\nknow what to do with himself--so terrible, probably, were the stings\r\nof his conscience! I don't remember all the absurd tricks they played,\r\nhowever; it was all in the same style, so that I felt at last painfully\r\nashamed.","And this same expression, as it were, of shame was reflected in\r\nthe whole public, even on the most sullen figures that had come out of\r\nthe refreshment-room. For some time all were silent and gazed with angry\r\nperplexity. When a man is ashamed he generally begins to get angry and\r\nis disposed to be cynical. By degrees a murmur arose in the audience.\r\n\r\n\"What's the meaning of it?\" a man who had come in from the\r\nrefreshment-room muttered in one of the groups.","\"It's silly.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's something literary. It's a criticism of the _Voice_.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that to me?\"\r\n\r\nFrom another group:\r\n\r\n\"Asses!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they are not asses; it's we who are the asses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are you an ass?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not an ass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you are not, I am certainly not.\"\r\n\r\nFrom a third group:\r\n\r\n\"We ought to give them a good smacking and send them flying.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pull down the hall!\"\r\n\r\nFrom a fourth group:\r\n\r\n\"I wonder the Lembkes are not ashamed to look on!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should they be ashamed? You are not.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am ashamed, and he is the governor.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are a pig.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've never seen such a commonplace ball in my life,\" a lady observed\r\nviciously, quite close to Yulia Mihailovna, obviously with the intention\r\nof being overheard. She was a stout lady of forty with rouge on her\r\ncheeks, wearing a bright-coloured silk dress. Almost every one in the\r\ntown knew her, but no one received her.","She was the widow of a civil\r\ncouncillor, who had left her a wooden house and a small pension; but\r\nshe lived well and kept horses. Two months previously she had called on\r\nYulia Mihailovna, but the latter had not received her.\r\n\r\n\"That might have been foreseen,\" she added, looking insolently into\r\nYulia Mihailovna's face.\r\n\r\n\"If you could foresee it, why did you come?\" Yulia Mihailovna could not\r\nresist saying.","\"Because I was too simple,\" the sprightly lady answered instantly, up in\r\narms and eager for the fray; but the general intervened.\r\n\r\n_\"Ch√®re dame\"_--he bent over to Yulia Mihailovna--\"you'd really better be\r\ngoing. We are only in their way and they'll enjoy themselves thoroughly\r\nwithout us. You've done your part, you've opened the ball, now leave\r\nthem in peace. And Andrey Antonovitch doesn't seem to be feeling quite\r\nsatisfactorily.","... To avoid trouble.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was too late.\r\n\r\nAll through the quadrille Andrey Antonovitch gazed at the dancers with a\r\nsort of angry perplexity, and when he heard the comments of the audience\r\nhe began looking about him uneasily. Then for the first time he caught\r\nsight of some of the persons who had come from the refreshment-room;\r\nthere was an expression of extreme wonder in his face. Suddenly there\r\nwas a loud roar of laughter at a caper that was cut in the quadrille.","The editor of the \"menacing periodical, not a Petersburg one,\" who was\r\ndancing with the cudgel in his hands, felt utterly unable to endure\r\nthe spectacled gaze of \"honest Russian thought,\" and not knowing how to\r\nescape it, suddenly in the last figure advanced to meet him standing on\r\nhis head, which was meant, by the way, to typify the continual turning\r\nupside down of common sense by the menacing non-Petersburg gazette.","As\r\nLyamshin was the only one who could walk standing on his head, he had\r\nundertaken to represent the editor with the cudgel. Yulia Mihailovna had\r\nhad no idea that anyone was going to walk on his head. \"They concealed\r\nthat from me, they concealed it,\" she repeated to me afterwards in\r\ndespair and indignation. The laughter from the crowd was, of course,\r\nprovoked not by the allegory, which interested no one, but simply by\r\na man's walking on his head in a swallow-tail coat.","Lembke flew into a\r\nrage and shook with fury.\r\n\r\n\"Rascal!\" he cried, pointing to Lyamshin, \"take hold of the scoundrel,\r\nturn him over... turn his legs... his head... so that his head's up...\r\nup!\"\r\n\r\nLyamshin jumped on to his feet. The laughter grew louder.\r\n\r\n\"Turn out all the scoundrels who are laughing!\" Lembke prescribed\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\nThere was an angry roar and laughter in the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"You can't do like that, your Excellency.","\"\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't abuse the public.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a fool yourself!\" a voice cried suddenly from a corner.\r\n\r\n\"Filibusters!\" shouted someone from the other end of the room.\r\n\r\nLembke looked round quickly at the shout and turned pale. A vacant smile\r\ncame on to his lips, as though he suddenly understood and remembered\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Yulia Mihailovna, addressing the crowd which was\r\npressing round them, as she drew her husband away--\"gentlemen, excuse\r\nAndrey Antonovitch.","Andrey Antonovitch is unwell... excuse... forgive\r\nhim, gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nI positively heard her say \"forgive him.\" It all happened very quickly.\r\nBut I remember for a fact that a section of the public rushed out of\r\nthe hall immediately after those words of Yulia Mihailovna's as though\r\npanic-stricken. I remember one hysterical, tearful feminine shriek:\r\n\r\n\"Ach, the same thing again!\"\r\n\r\nAnd in the retreat of the guests, which was almost becoming a crush,\r\nanother bomb exploded exactly as in the afternoon.","\"Fire! All the riverside quarter is on fire!\"\r\n\r\nI don't remember where this terrible cry rose first, whether it was\r\nfirst raised in the hall, or whether someone ran upstairs from the\r\nentry, but it was followed by such alarm that I can't attempt to\r\ndescribe it. More than half the guests at the ball came from the quarter\r\nbeyond the river, and were owners or occupiers of wooden houses in that\r\ndistrict.","They rushed to the windows, pulled back the curtains in a\r\nflash, and tore down the blinds. The riverside was in flames. The fire,\r\nit is true, was only beginning, but it was in flames in three separate\r\nplaces--and that was what was alarming.\r\n\r\n\"Arson! The Shpigulin men!\" roared the crowd.\r\n\r\nI remember some very characteristic exclamations:\r\n\r\n\"I've had a presentiment in my heart that there'd be arson, I've had a\r\npresentiment of it these last few days!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Shpigulin men, the Shpigulin men, no one else!\"\r\n\r\n\"We were all lured here on purpose to set fire to it!\"\r\n\r\nThis last most amazing exclamation came from a woman; it was an\r\nunintentional involuntary shriek of a housewife whose goods were\r\nburning.","Every one rushed for the door. I won't describe the crush in\r\nthe vestibule over sorting out cloaks, shawls, and pelisses, the shrieks\r\nof the frightened women, the weeping of the young ladies. I doubt\r\nwhether there was any theft, but it was no wonder that in such disorder\r\nsome went away without their wraps because they were unable to find\r\nthem, and this grew into a legend with many additions, long preserved in\r\nthe town.","Lembke and Yulia Mihailovna were almost crushed by the crowd\r\nat the doors.\r\n\r\n\"Stop, every one! Don't let anyone out!\" yelled Lembke, stretching out\r\nhis arms menacingly towards the crowding people.\r\n\r\n\"Every one without exception to be strictly searched at once!\"\r\n\r\nA storm of violent oaths rose from the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"Andrey Antonovitch! Andrey Antonovitch!\" cried Yulia Mihailovna in\r\ncomplete despair.","\"Arrest her first!\" shouted her husband, pointing his finger at her\r\nthreateningly. \"Search her first! The ball was arranged with a view to\r\nthe fire....\"\r\n\r\nShe screamed and fell into a swoon. (Oh, there was no doubt of its being\r\na real one.) The general, the prince, and I rushed to her assistance;\r\nthere were others, even among the ladies, who helped us at that\r\ndifficult moment. We carried the unhappy woman out of this hell to her\r\ncarriage, but she only regained consciousness as she reached the house,\r\nand her first utterance was about Andrey Antonovitch again.","With the\r\ndestruction of all her fancies, the only thing left in her mind was\r\nAndrey Antonovitch. They sent for a doctor. I remained with her for a\r\nwhole hour; the prince did so too. The general, in an access of generous\r\nfeeling (though he had been terribly scared), meant to remain all night\r\n\"by the bedside of the unhappy lady,\" but within ten minutes he fell\r\nasleep in an arm-chair in the drawing-room while waiting for the doctor,\r\nand there we left him.","The chief of the police, who had hurried from the ball to the fire, had\r\nsucceeded in getting Andrey Antonovitch out of the hall after us, and\r\nattempted to put him into Yulia Mihailovna's carriage, trying all he\r\ncould to persuade his Excellency \"to seek repose.\" But I don't know\r\nwhy he did not insist. Andrey Antonovitch, of course, would not hear of\r\nrepose, and was set on going to the fire; but that was not a sufficient\r\nreason.","It ended in his taking him to the fire in his droshky. He told\r\nus afterwards that Lembke was gesticulating all the way and \"shouting\r\norders that it was impossible to obey owing to their unusualness.\" It\r\nwas officially reported later on that his Excellency had at that time\r\nbeen in a delirious condition \"owing to a sudden fright.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no need to describe how the ball ended. A few dozen rowdy\r\nfellows, and with them some ladies, remained in the hall.","There were\r\nno police present. They would not let the orchestra go, and beat\r\nthe musicians who attempted to leave. By morning they had pulled all\r\nProhoritch's stall to pieces, had drunk themselves senseless, danced the\r\nKamarinsky in its unexpurgated form, made the rooms in a shocking mess,\r\nand only towards daybreak part of this hopelessly drunken rabble reached\r\nthe scene of the fire to make fresh disturbances there.","The other part\r\nspent the night in the rooms dead drunk, with disastrous consequences\r\nto the velvet sofas and the floor. Next morning, at the earliest\r\npossibility, they were dragged out by their legs into the street. So\r\nended the f√™te for the benefit of the governesses of our province.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe fire frightened the inhabitants of the riverside just because it\r\nwas evidently a case of arson. It was curious that at the first cry of\r\n\"fire\" another cry was raised that the Shpigulin men had done it.","It\r\nis now well known that three Shpigulin men really did have a share in\r\nsetting fire to the town, but that was all; all the other factory\r\nhands were completely acquitted, not only officially but also by public\r\nopinion. Besides those three rascals (of whom one has been caught and\r\nconfessed and the other two have so far escaped), Fedka the convict\r\nundoubtedly had a hand in the arson. That is all that is known for\r\ncertain about the fire till now; but when it comes to conjectures it's\r\na very different matter.","What had led these three rascals to do it? Had\r\nthey been instigated by anyone? It is very difficult to answer all these\r\nquestions even now.\r\n\r\nOwing to the strong wind, the fact that the houses at the riverside were\r\nalmost all wooden, and that they had been set fire to in three\r\nplaces, the fire spread quickly and enveloped the whole quarter with\r\nextraordinary rapidity. (The fire burnt, however, only at two ends;\r\nat the third spot it was extinguished almost as soon as it began to\r\nburn--of which later.",") But the Petersburg and Moscow papers exaggerated\r\nour calamity. Not more than a quarter, roughly speaking, of the\r\nriverside district was burnt down; possibly less indeed. Our fire\r\nbrigade, though it was hardly adequate to the size and population of the\r\ntown, worked with great promptitude and devotion. But it would not\r\nhave been of much avail, even with the zealous co-operation of the\r\ninhabitants, if the wind had not suddenly dropped towards morning.","When\r\nan hour after our flight from the ball I made my way to the riverside,\r\nthe fire was at its height. A whole street parallel with the river was\r\nin flames. It was as light as day. I won't describe the fire; every one\r\nin Russia knows what it looks like. The bustle and crush was immense in\r\nthe lanes adjoining the burning street. The inhabitants, fully expecting\r\nthe fire to reach their houses, were hauling out their belongings, but\r\nhad not yet left their dwellings, and were waiting meanwhile sitting\r\non their boxes and feather beds under their windows.","Part of the male\r\npopulation were hard at work ruthlessly chopping down fences and even\r\nwhole huts which were near the fire and on the windward side. None\r\nwere crying except the children, who had been waked out of their sleep,\r\nthough the women who had dragged out their chattels were lamenting\r\nin sing-song voices. Those who had not finished their task were still\r\nsilent, busily carrying out their goods.","Sparks and embers were carried\r\na long way in all directions. People put them out as best they could.\r\nSome helped to put the fire out while others stood about, admiring it. A\r\ngreat fire at night always has a thrilling and exhilarating effect.\r\nThis is what explains the attraction of fireworks. But in that case the\r\nartistic regularity with which the fire is presented and the complete\r\nlack of danger give an impression of lightness and playfulness like the\r\neffect of a glass of champagne.","A real conflagration is a very different\r\nmatter. Then the horror and a certain sense of personal danger,\r\ntogether with the exhilarating effect of a fire at night, produce on the\r\nspectator (though of course not in the householder whose goods are being\r\nburnt) a certain concussion of the brain and, as it were, a challenge to\r\nthose destructive instincts which, alas, lie hidden in every heart, even\r\nthat of the mildest and most domestic little clerk.","... This sinister\r\nsensation is almost always fascinating. \"I really don't know whether one\r\ncan look at a fire without a certain pleasure.\" This is word for word\r\nwhat Stepan Trofimovitch said to me one night on returning home after he\r\nhad happened to witness a fire and was still under the influence of the\r\nspectacle. Of course, the very man who enjoys the spectacle will rush\r\ninto the fire himself to save a child or an old woman; but that is\r\naltogether a different matter.","Following in the wake of the crowd of sightseers, I succeeded, without\r\nasking questions, in reaching the chief centre of danger, where at last\r\nI saw Lembke, whom I was seeking at Yulia Mihailovna's request. His\r\nposition was strange and extraordinary. He was standing on the ruins of\r\na fence. Thirty paces to the left of him rose the black skeleton of a\r\ntwo-storied house which had almost burnt out.","It had holes instead of\r\nwindows at each story, its roof had fallen in, and the flames were still\r\nhere and there creeping among the charred beams. At the farther end\r\nof the courtyard, twenty paces away, the lodge, also a two-storied\r\nbuilding, was beginning to burn, and the firemen were doing their utmost\r\nto save it. On the right the firemen and the people were trying to save\r\na rather large wooden building which was not actually burning, though\r\nit had caught fire several times and was inevitably bound to be burnt in\r\nthe end.","Lembke stood facing the lodge, shouting and gesticulating. He\r\nwas giving orders which no one attempted to carry out. It seemed to me\r\nthat every one had given him up as hopeless and left him. Anyway,\r\nthough every one in the vast crowd of all classes, among whom there\r\nwere gentlemen, and even the cathedral priest, was listening to him\r\nwith curiosity and wonder, no one spoke to him or tried to get him away.","Lembke, with a pale face and glittering eyes, was uttering the most\r\namazing things. To complete the picture, he had lost his hat and was\r\nbareheaded.\r\n\r\n\"It's all incendiarism! It's nihilism! If anything is burning, it's\r\nnihilism!\" I heard almost with horror; and though there was nothing to\r\nbe surprised at, yet actual madness, when one sees it, always gives one\r\na shock.\r\n\r\n\"Your Excellency,\" said a policeman, coming up to him, \"what if you were\r\nto try the repose of home?.",".. It's dangerous for your Excellency even to\r\nstand here.\"\r\n\r\nThis policeman, as I heard afterwards, had been told off by the chief\r\nof police to watch over Andrey Antonovitch, to do his utmost to get him\r\nhome, and in case of danger even to use force--a task evidently beyond\r\nthe man's power.\r\n\r\n\"They will wipe away the tears of the people whose houses have been\r\nburnt, but they will burn down the town.","It's all the work of four\r\nscoundrels, four and a half! Arrest the scoundrel! He worms himself into\r\nthe honour of families. They made use of the governesses to burn down\r\nthe houses. It's vile, vile! Aie, what's he about?\" he shouted, suddenly\r\nnoticing a fireman at the top of the burning lodge, under whom the roof\r\nhad almost burnt away and round whom the flames were beginning to flare\r\nup. \"Pull him down! Pull him down! He will fall, he will catch fire, put\r\nhim out!.",".. What is he doing there?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is putting the fire out, your Excellency.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not likely. The fire is in the minds of men and not in the roofs of\r\nhouses. Pull him down and give it up! Better give it up, much better!\r\nLet it put itself out. Aie, who is crying now? An old woman! It's an old\r\nwoman shouting. Why have they forgotten the old woman?\"\r\n\r\nThere actually was an old woman crying on the ground floor of the\r\nburning lodge.","She was an old creature of eighty, a relation of the\r\nshopkeeper who owned the house. But she had not been forgotten; she had\r\ngone back to the burning house while it was still possible, with the\r\ninsane idea of rescuing her feather bed from a corner room which was\r\nstill untouched. Choking with the smoke and screaming with the heat, for\r\nthe room was on fire by the time she reached it, she was still trying\r\nwith her decrepit hands to squeeze her feather bed through a broken\r\nwindow pane.","Lembke rushed to her assistance. Every one saw him run up\r\nto the window, catch hold of one corner of the feather bed and try with\r\nall his might to pull it out. As ill luck would have it, a board fell at\r\nthat moment from the roof and hit the unhappy governor. It did not\r\nkill him, it merely grazed him on the neck as it fell, but Andrey\r\nAntonovitch's career was over, among us at least; the blow knocked him\r\noff his feet and he sank on the ground unconscious.","The day dawned at last, gloomy and sullen. The fire was abating; the\r\nwind was followed by a sudden calm, and then a fine drizzling rain fell.\r\nI was by that time in another part, some distance from where Lembke had\r\nfallen, and here I overheard very strange conversations in the crowd. A\r\nstrange fact had come to light. On the very outskirts of the quarter,\r\non a piece of waste land beyond the kitchen gardens, not less than fifty\r\npaces from any other buildings, there stood a little wooden house which\r\nhad only lately been built, and this solitary house had been on fire at\r\nthe very beginning, almost before any other.","Even had it burnt down, it\r\nwas so far from other houses that no other building in the town could\r\nhave caught fire from it, and, vice versa, if the whole riverside\r\nhad been burnt to the ground, that house might have remained intact,\r\nwhatever the wind had been. It followed that it had caught fire\r\nseparately and independently and therefore not accidentally. But the\r\nchief point was that it was not burnt to the ground, and at daybreak\r\nstrange things were discovered within it.","The owner of this new house,\r\nwho lived in the neighbourhood, rushed up as soon as he saw it in flames\r\nand with the help of his neighbours pulled apart a pile of faggots which\r\nhad been heaped up by the side wall and set fire to. In this way he\r\nsaved the house. But there were lodgers in the house--the captain, who\r\nwas well known in the town, his sister, and their elderly servant, and\r\nthese three persons--the captain, his sister, and their servant--had\r\nbeen murdered and apparently robbed in the night.","(It was here that the\r\nchief of police had gone while Lembke was rescuing the feather bed.)\r\n\r\nBy morning the news had spread and an immense crowd of all classes, even\r\nthe riverside people who had been burnt out had flocked to the waste\r\nland where the new house stood. It was difficult to get there, so dense\r\nwas the crowd. I was told at once that the captain had been found lying\r\ndressed on the bench with his throat cut, and that he must have been\r\ndead drunk when he was killed, so that he had felt nothing, and he had\r\n\"bled like a bull\"; that his sister Marya Timofeyevna had been \"stabbed\r\nall over\" with a knife and she was lying on the floor in the doorway, so\r\nthat probably she had been awake and had fought and struggled with the\r\nmurderer.","The servant, who had also probably been awake, had her skull\r\nbroken. The owner of the house said that the captain had come to see him\r\nthe morning before, and that in his drunken bragging he had shown him a\r\nlot of money, as much as two hundred roubles. The captain's shabby old\r\ngreen pocket-book was found empty on the floor, but Marya Timofeyevna's\r\nbox had not been touched, and the silver setting of the ikon had not\r\nbeen removed either; the captain's clothes, too, had not been disturbed.","It was evident that the thief had been in a hurry and was a man familiar\r\nwith the captain's circumstances, who had come only for money and knew\r\nwhere it was kept. If the owner of the house had not run up at that\r\nmoment the burning faggot stack would certainly have set fire to the\r\nhouse and \"it would have been difficult to find out from the charred\r\ncorpses how they had died.\"\r\n\r\nSo the story was told.","One other fact was added: that the person who\r\nhad taken this house for the Lebyadkins was no other than Mr. Stavrogin,\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch, the son of Varvara Petrovna. He had come\r\nhimself to take it and had had much ado to persuade the owner to let\r\nit, as the latter had intended to use it as a tavern; but Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch was ready to give any rent he asked and had paid for six\r\nmonths in advance.","\"The fire wasn't an accident,\" I heard said in the crowd.\r\n\r\nBut the majority said nothing. People's faces were sullen, but I did\r\nnot see signs of much indignation. People persisted, however, in\r\ngossiping about Stavrogin, saying that the murdered woman was his wife;\r\nthat on the previous day he had \"dishonourably\" abducted a young lady\r\nbelonging to the best family in the place, the daughter of Madame\r\nDrozdov, and that a complaint was to be lodged against him in\r\nPetersburg; and that his wife had been murdered evidently that he might\r\nmarry the young lady.","Skvoreshniki was not more than a mile and a half\r\naway, and I remember I wondered whether I should not let them know the\r\nposition of affairs. I did not notice, however, that there was anyone\r\negging the crowd on and I don't want to accuse people falsely, though I\r\ndid see and recognised at once in the crowd at the fire two or three\r\nof the rowdy lot I had seen in the refreshment-room. I particularly\r\nremember one thin, tall fellow, a cabinet-maker, as I found out later,\r\nwith an emaciated face and a curly head, black as though grimed with\r\nsoot.","He was not drunk, but in contrast to the gloomy passivity of the\r\ncrowd seemed beside himself with excitement. He kept addressing the\r\npeople, though I don't remember his words; nothing coherent that he said\r\nwas longer than \"I say, lads, what do you say to this? Are things to go\r\non like this?\" and so saying he waved his arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. A ROMANCE ENDED\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nFROM THE LARGE BALLROOM of Skvoreshniki (the room in which the last\r\ninterview with Varvara Petrovna and Stepan Trofimovitch had taken place)\r\nthe fire could be plainly seen.","At daybreak, soon after five in the\r\nmorning, Liza was standing at the farthest window on the right looking\r\nintently at the fading glow. She was alone in the room. She was wearing\r\nthe dress she had worn the day before at the matin√©e--a very smart light\r\ngreen dress covered with lace, but crushed and put on carelessly and\r\nwith haste. Suddenly noticing that some of the hooks were undone in\r\nfront she flushed, hurriedly set it right, snatched up from a chair the\r\nred shawl she had flung down when she came in the day before, and put\r\nit round her neck.","Some locks of her luxuriant hair had come loose and\r\nshowed below the shawl on her right shoulder. Her face looked weary and\r\ncareworn, but her eyes glowed under her frowning brows. She went up to\r\nthe window again and pressed her burning forehead against the cold pane.\r\nThe door opened and Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch came in.\r\n\r\n\"I've sent a messenger on horseback,\" he said. \"In ten minutes we shall\r\nhear all about it, meantime the servants say that part of the riverside\r\nquarter has been burnt down, on the right side of the bridge near the\r\nquay.","It's been burning since eleven o'clock; now the fire is going\r\ndown.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not go near the window, but stood three steps behind her; she did\r\nnot turn towards him.\r\n\r\n\"It ought to have been light an hour ago by the calendar, and it's still\r\nalmost night,\" she said irritably.\r\n\r\n\"'Calendars always tell lies,'\" he observed with a polite smile, but,\r\na little ashamed; he made haste to add: \"It's dull to live by the\r\ncalendar, Liza.","\"\r\n\r\nAnd he relapsed into silence, vexed at the ineptitude of the second\r\nsentence. Liza gave a wry smile.\r\n\r\n\"You are in such a melancholy mood that you cannot even find words to\r\nspeak to me. But you need not trouble, there's a point in what you said.\r\nI always live by the calendar. Every step I take is regulated by the\r\ncalendar. Does that surprise you?\"\r\n\r\nShe turned quickly from the window and sat down in a low chair.","\"You sit down, too, please. We haven't long to be together and I want to\r\nsay anything I like.... Why shouldn't you, too, say anything you like?\"\r\n\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch sat beside her and softly, almost timidly took\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n\"What's the meaning of this tone, Liza? Where has it suddenly sprung\r\nfrom? What do you mean by 'we haven't long to be together'? That's the\r\nsecond mysterious phrase since you waked, half an hour ago.","\"\r\n\r\n\"You are beginning to reckon up my mysterious phrases!\" she laughed.\r\n\"Do you remember I told you I was a dead woman when I came in yesterday?\r\nThat you thought fit to forget. To forget or not to notice.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember, Liza. Why dead? You must live.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is that all? You've quite lost your flow of words. I've lived my\r\nhour and that's enough. Do you remember Christopher Ivanovitch?\"\r\n\r\n\"No I don't,\" he answered, frowning.","\"Christopher Ivanovitch at Lausanne? He bored you dreadfully. He always\r\nused to open the door and say, 'I've come for one minute,' and then stay\r\nthe whole day. I don't want to be like Christopher Ivanovitch and stay\r\nthe whole day.\"\r\n\r\nA look of pain came into his face.\r\n\r\n\"Liza, it grieves me, this unnatural language. This affectation must\r\nhurt you, too. What's it for? What's the object of it?\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes glowed.","\"Liza,\" he cried, \"I swear I love you now more than yesterday when you\r\ncame to me!\"\r\n\r\n\"What a strange declaration! Why bring in yesterday and to-day and these\r\ncomparisons?\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't leave me,\" he went on, almost with despair; \"we will go away\r\ntogether, to-day, won't we? Won't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aie, don't squeeze my hand so painfully! Where could we go together\r\nto-day? To 'rise again' somewhere? No, we've made experiments enough.","..\r\nand it's too slow for me; and I am not fit for it; it's too exalted\r\nfor me. If we are to go, let it be to Moscow, to pay visits and\r\nentertain--that's my ideal you know; even in Switzerland I didn't\r\ndisguise from you what I was like. As we can't go to Moscow and pay\r\nvisits since you are married, it's no use talking of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Liza! What happened yesterday!\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened is over!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's impossible! That's cruel!\"\r\n\r\n\"What if it is cruel? You must bear it if it is cruel.","\"\r\n\r\n\"You are avenging yourself on me for yesterday's caprice,\" he muttered\r\nwith an angry smile. Liza flushed.\r\n\r\n\"What a mean thought!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why then did you bestow on me... so great a happiness? Have I the right\r\nto know?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you must manage without rights; don't aggravate the meanness of\r\nyour supposition by stupidity. You are not lucky to-day. By the way, you\r\nsurely can't be afraid of public opinion and that you will be blamed\r\nfor this 'great happiness'? If that's it, for God's sake don't alarm\r\nyourself.","It's not your doing at all and you are not responsible to\r\nanyone. When I opened your door yesterday, you didn't even know who was\r\ncoming in. It was simply my caprice, as you expressed it just now,\r\nand nothing more! You can look every one in the face boldly and\r\ntriumphantly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your words, that laugh, have been making me feel cold with horror for\r\nthe last hour. That 'happiness' of which you speak frantically is\r\nworth.",".. everything to me. How can I lose you now? I swear I loved you\r\nless yesterday. Why are you taking everything from me to-day? Do you\r\nknow what it has cost me, this new hope? I've paid for it with life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your own life or another's?\"\r\n\r\nHe got up quickly.\r\n\r\n\"What does that mean?\" he brought out, looking at her steadily.\r\n\r\n\"Have you paid for it with your life or with mine? is what I mean. Or\r\nhave you lost all power of understanding?\" cried Liza, flushing.","\"Why\r\ndid you start up so suddenly? Why do you stare at me with such a look?\r\nYou frighten me. What is it you are afraid of all the time? I noticed\r\nsome time ago that you were afraid and you are now, this very minute...\r\nGood heavens, how pale you are!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you know anything, Liza, I swear I don't... and I wasn't talking of\r\n_that_ just now when I said that I had paid for it with life....\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand you,\" she brought out, faltering apprehensively.","At last a slow brooding smile came on to his lips. He slowly sat down,\r\nput his elbows on his knees, and covered his face with his hands.\r\n\r\n\"A bad dream and delirium.... We were talking of two different things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what you were talking about.... Do you mean to say you did\r\nnot know yesterday that I should leave you to-day, did you know or not?\r\nDon't tell a lie, did you or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" he said softly.","\"Well then, what would you have? You knew and yet you accepted 'that\r\nmoment' for yourself. Aren't we quits?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me the whole truth,\" he cried in intense distress. \"When you\r\nopened my door yesterday, did you know yourself that it was only for one\r\nhour?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with hatred.\r\n\r\n\"Really, the most sensible person can ask most amazing questions. And\r\nwhy are you so uneasy? Can it be vanity that a woman should leave you\r\nfirst instead of your leaving her? Do you know, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch,\r\nsince I've been with you I've discovered that you are very generous to\r\nme, and it's just that I can't endure from you.","\"\r\n\r\nHe got up from his seat and took a few steps about the room.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, perhaps it was bound to end so.... But how can it all have\r\nhappened?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a question to worry about! Especially as you know the answer\r\nyourself perfectly well, and understand it better than anyone on earth,\r\nand were counting on it yourself. I am a young lady, my heart has been\r\ntrained on the opera, that's how it all began, that's the solution.","\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing in it to fret your vanity. It is all the absolute\r\ntruth. It began with a fine moment which was too much for me to bear.\r\nThe day before yesterday, when I 'insulted' you before every one and you\r\nanswered me so chivalrously, I went home and guessed at once that\r\nyou were running away from me because you were married, and not from\r\ncontempt for me which, as a fashionable young lady, I dreaded more than\r\nanything.","I understood that it was for my sake, for me, mad as I was,\r\nthat you ran away. You see how I appreciate your generosity. Then Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch skipped up to me and explained it all to me at once. He\r\nrevealed to me that you were dominated by a 'great idea,' before which\r\nhe and I were as nothing, but yet that I was a stumbling-block in your\r\npath. He brought himself in, he insisted that we three should work\r\ntogether, and said the most fantastic things about a boat and about\r\nmaple-wood oars out of some Russian song.","I complimented him and told\r\nhim he was a poet, which he swallowed as the real thing. And as apart\r\nfrom him I had known long before that I had not the strength to do\r\nanything for long, I made up my mind on the spot. Well, that's all and\r\nquite enough, and please let us have no more explanations. We might\r\nquarrel. Don't be afraid of anyone, I take it all on myself. I am horrid\r\nand capricious, I was fascinated by that operatic boat, I am a young\r\nlady.",".. but you know I did think that you were dreadfully in love\r\nwith me. Don't despise the poor fool, and don't laugh at the tear that\r\ndropped just now. I am awfully given to crying with self-pity. Come,\r\nthat's enough, that's enough. I am no good for anything and you are\r\nno good for anything; it's as bad for both of us, so let's comfort\r\nourselves with that. Anyway, it eases our vanity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dream and delirium,\" cried Stavrogin, wringing his hands, and pacing\r\nabout the room.","\"Liza, poor child, what have you done to yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've burnt myself in a candle, nothing more. Surely you are not crying,\r\ntoo? You should show less feeling and better breeding....\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, why did you come to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you understand what a ludicrous position you put yourself in in\r\nthe eyes of the world by asking such questions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why have you ruined yourself, so grotesquely and so stupidly, and\r\nwhat's to be done now?\"\r\n\r\n\"And this is Stavrogin, 'the vampire Stavrogin,' as you are called by a\r\nlady here who is in love with you! Listen! I have told you already, I've\r\nput all my life into one hour and I am at peace.","Do the same with\r\nyours... though you've no need to: you have plenty of 'hours' and\r\n'moments' of all sorts before you.\"\r\n\r\n\"As many as you; I give you my solemn word, not one hour more than you!\"\r\n\r\nHe was still walking up and down and did not see the rapid penetrating\r\nglance she turned upon him, in which there seemed a dawning hope. But\r\nthe light died away at the same moment.\r\n\r\n\"If you knew what it costs me that I can't be sincere at this moment,\r\nLiza, if I could only tell you.","..\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me? You want to tell me something, to me? God save me from your\r\nsecrets!\" she broke in almost in terror. He stopped and waited uneasily.\r\n\r\n\"I ought to confess that ever since those days in Switzerland I have\r\nhad a strong feeling that you have something awful, loathsome, some\r\nbloodshed on your conscience... and yet something that would make you\r\nlook very ridiculous. Beware of telling me, if it's true: I shall laugh\r\nyou to scorn.","I shall laugh at you for the rest of your life.... Aie,\r\nyou are turning pale again? I won't, I won't, I'll go at once.\" She\r\njumped up from her chair with a movement of disgust and contempt.\r\n\r\n\"Torture me, punish me, vent your spite on me,\" he cried in despair.\r\n\"You have the full right. I knew I did not love you and yet I ruined\r\nyou! Yes, I accepted the moment for my own; I had a hope... I've had\r\nit a long time.",".. my last hope.... I could not resist the radiance that\r\nflooded my heart when you came in to me yesterday, of yourself, alone,\r\nof your own accord. I suddenly believed.... Perhaps I have faith in it\r\nstill.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will repay such noble frankness by being as frank. I don't want to be\r\na Sister of Mercy for you. Perhaps I really may become a nurse unless I\r\nhappen appropriately to die to-day; but if I do I won't be your nurse,\r\nthough, of course, you need one as much as any crippled creature.","I\r\nalways fancied that you would take me to some place where there was a\r\nhuge wicked spider, big as a man, and we should spend our lives looking\r\nat it and being afraid of it. That's how our love would spend itself.\r\nAppeal to Dashenka; she will go with you anywhere you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you help thinking of her even now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor little spaniel! Give her my greetings. Does she know that even in\r\nSwitzerland you had fixed on her for your old age? What prudence! What\r\nforesight! Aie, who's that?\"\r\n\r\nAt the farther end of the room a door opened a crack; a head was thrust\r\nin and vanished again hurriedly.","\"Is that you, Alexey Yegorytch?\" asked Stavrogin.\r\n\r\n\"No, it's only I.\" Pyotr Stepanovitch thrust himself half in again.\r\n\"How do you do, Lizaveta Nikolaevna? Good morning, anyway. I guessed I\r\nshould find you both in this room. I have come for one moment literally,\r\nNikolay Vsyevolodovitch. I was anxious to have a couple of words with\r\nyou at all costs... absolutely necessary... only a few words!\"\r\n\r\nStavrogin moved towards him but turned back to Liza at the third step.","\"If you hear anything directly, Liza, let me tell you I am to blame for\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\nShe started and looked at him in dismay; but he hurriedly went out.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe room from which Pyotr Stepanovitch had peeped in was a large\r\noval vestibule. Alexey Yegorytch had been sitting there before Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch came in, but the latter sent him away. Stavrogin closed the\r\ndoor after him and stood expectant.","Pyotr Stepanovitch looked rapidly\r\nand searchingly at him.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you know already,\" said Pyotr Stepanovitch hurriedly, his eyes\r\nlooking as though they would dive into Stavrogin's soul, \"then, of\r\ncourse, we are none of us to blame, above all not you, for it's such a\r\nconcatenation... such a coincidence of events... in brief, you can't be\r\nlegally implicated and I've rushed here to tell you so beforehand.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Have they been burnt? murdered?\"\r\n\r\n\"Murdered but not burnt, that's the trouble, but I give you my word of\r\nhonour that it's not been my fault, however much you may suspect me,\r\neh? Do you want the whole truth: you see the idea really did cross my\r\nmind--you hinted it yourself, not seriously, but teasing me (for, of\r\ncourse, you would not hint it seriously), but I couldn't bring myself\r\nto it, and wouldn't bring myself to it for anything, not for a hundred\r\nroubles--and what was there to be gained by it, I mean for me, for\r\nme.","...\" (He was in desperate haste and his talk was like the clacking of a\r\nrattle.) \"But what a coincidence of circumstances: I gave that drunken\r\nfool Lebyadkin two hundred and thirty roubles of my own money (do you\r\nhear, my own money, there wasn't a rouble of yours and, what's more, you\r\nknow it yourself) the day before yesterday, in the evening--do you hear,\r\nnot yesterday after the matin√©e, but the day before yesterday, make a\r\nnote of it: it's a very important coincidence for I did not know for\r\ncertain at that time whether Lizaveta Nikolaevna would come to you or\r\nnot; I gave my own money simply because you distinguished yourself by\r\ntaking it into your head to betray your secret to every one.","Well, I\r\nwon't go into that... that's your affair... your chivalry, but I must\r\nown I was amazed, it was a knock-down blow. And forasmuch as I was\r\nexceeding weary of these tragic stories--and let me tell you, I talk\r\nseriously though I do use Biblical language--as it was all upsetting\r\nmy plans in fact, I made up my mind at any cost, and without your\r\nknowledge, to pack the Lebyadkins off to Petersburg, especially as he\r\nwas set on going himself.","I made one mistake: I gave the money in your\r\nname;--was it a mistake or not? Perhaps it wasn't a mistake, eh? Listen\r\nnow, listen how it has all turned out....\"\r\n\r\nIn the heat of his talk he went close up to Stavrogin and took hold of\r\nthe revers of his coat (really, it may have been on purpose). With a\r\nviolent movement Stavrogin struck him on the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Come, what is it... give over... you'll break my arm.",".. what matters\r\nis the way things have turned out,\" he rattled on, not in the least\r\nsurprised at the blow. \"I forked out the money in the evening on\r\ncondition that his sister and he should set off early next morning; I\r\ntrusted that rascal Liputin with the job of getting them into the train\r\nand seeing them off. But that beast Liputin wanted to play his schoolboy\r\npranks on the public--perhaps you heard? At the matin√©e? Listen, listen:\r\nthey both got drunk, made up verses of which half are Liputin's; he\r\nrigged Lebyadkin out in a dress-coat, assuring me meanwhile that he had\r\npacked him off that morning, but he kept him shut somewhere in a back\r\nroom, till he thrust him on the platform at the matin√©e.","But Lebyadkin\r\ngot drunk quickly and unexpectedly. Then came the scandalous scene you\r\nknow of, and then they got him home more dead than alive, and Liputin\r\nfilched away the two hundred roubles, leaving him only small change. But\r\nit appears unluckily that already that morning Lebyadkin had taken that\r\ntwo hundred roubles out of his pocket, boasted of it and shown it in\r\nundesirable quarters. And as that was just what Fedka was expecting, and\r\nas he had heard something at Kirillov's (do you remember, your hint?) he\r\nmade up his mind to take advantage of it.","That's the whole truth. I\r\nam glad, anyway, that Fedka did not find the money, the rascal was\r\nreckoning on a thousand, you know! He was in a hurry and seems to have\r\nbeen frightened by the fire himself.... Would you believe it, that fire\r\ncame as a thunderbolt for me. Devil only knows what to make of it! It is\r\ntaking things into their own hands.... You see, as I expect so much of\r\nyou I will hide nothing from you: I've long been hatching this idea of a\r\nfire because it suits the national and popular taste; but I was keeping\r\nit for a critical moment, for that precious time when we should all rise\r\nup and.",".. And they suddenly took it into their heads to do it, on their\r\nown initiative, without orders, now at the very moment when we ought to\r\nbe lying low and keeping quiet! Such presumption!... The fact is, I've\r\nnot got to the bottom of it yet, they talk about two Shpigulin men, but\r\nif there are any of _our_ fellows in it, if any one of them has had a hand\r\nin it--so much the worse for him! You see what comes of letting people\r\nget ever so little out of hand! No, this democratic rabble, with\r\nits quintets, is a poor foundation; what we want is one magnificent,\r\ndespotic will, like an idol, resting on something fundamental and\r\nexternal.","... Then the quintets will cringe into obedience and be\r\nobsequiously ready on occasion. But, anyway, though, they are all crying\r\nout now that Stavrogin wanted his wife to be burnt and that that's what\r\ncaused the fire in the town, but...\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, are they all saying that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, not yet, and I must confess I have heard nothing of the sort, but\r\nwhat one can do with people, especially when they've been burnt out! _Vox\r\npopuli vox Dei_.","A stupid rumour is soon set going. But you really have\r\nnothing to be afraid of. From the legal point of view you are all right,\r\nand with your conscience also. For you didn't want it done, did you?\r\nThere's no clue, nothing but the coincidence.... The only thing is Fedka\r\nmay remember what you said that night at Kirillov's (and what made you\r\nsay it?) but that proves nothing and we shall stop Fedka's mouth.","I\r\nshall stop it to-day....\"\r\n\r\n\"And weren't the bodies burnt at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit; that ruffian could not manage anything properly. But I am\r\nglad, anyway, that you are so calm... for though you are not in any way\r\nto blame, even in thought, but all the same.... And you must admit that\r\nall this settles your difficulties capitally: you are suddenly free and\r\na widower and can marry a charming girl this minute with a lot of money,\r\nwho is already yours, into the bargain.","See what can be done by crude,\r\nsimple coincidence--eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you threatening me, you fool?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, leave off, leave off! Here you are, calling me a fool, and what\r\na tone to use! You ought to be glad, yet you... I rushed here on purpose\r\nto let you know in good time.... Besides, how could I threaten you?\r\nAs if I cared for what I could get by threats! I want you to help from\r\ngoodwill and not from fear.","You are the light and the sun.... It's\r\nI who am terribly afraid of you, not you of me! I am not Mavriky\r\nNikolaevitch.... And only fancy, as I flew here in a racing droshky I\r\nsaw Mavriky Nikolaevitch by the fence at the farthest corner of your\r\ngarden... in his greatcoat, drenched through, he must have been sitting\r\nthere all night! Queer goings on! How mad people can be!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mavriky Nikolaevitch? Is that true?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes.","He is sitting by the garden fence. About three hundred paces\r\nfrom here, I think. I made haste to pass him, but he saw me. Didn't you\r\nknow? In that case I am glad I didn't forget to tell you. A man like\r\nthat is more dangerous than anyone if he happens to have a revolver\r\nabout him, and then the night, the sleet, or natural irritability--for\r\nafter all he is in a nice position, ha ha! What do you think? Why is he\r\nsitting there?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is waiting for Lizaveta Nikolaevna, of course.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Well! Why should she go out to him? And... in such rain too... what a\r\nfool!\"\r\n\r\n\"She is just going out to him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh! That's a piece of news! So then... But listen, her position is\r\ncompletely changed now. What does she want with Mavriky now? You\r\nare free, a widower, and can marry her to-morrow. She doesn't know\r\nyet--leave it to me and I'll arrange it all for you. Where is she? We\r\nmust relieve her mind too.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Relieve her mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather! Let's go.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you suppose she won't guess what those dead bodies mean?\" said\r\nStavrogin, screwing up his eyes in a peculiar way.\r\n\r\n\"Of course she won't,\" said Pyotr Stepanovitch with all the confidence\r\nof a perfect simpleton, \"for legally... Ech, what a man you are! What\r\nif she did guess? Women are so clever at shutting their eyes to such\r\nthings, you don't understand women! Apart from it's being altogether\r\nto her interest to marry you now, because there's no denying she's\r\ndisgraced herself; apart from that, I talked to her of 'the boat' and I\r\nsaw that one could affect her by it, so that shows you what the girl is\r\nmade of.","Don't be uneasy, she will step over those dead bodies without\r\nturning a hair--especially as you are not to blame for them; not in the\r\nleast, are you? She will only keep them in reserve to use them against\r\nyou when you've been married two or three years. Every woman saves up\r\nsomething of the sort out of her husband's past when she gets married,\r\nbut by that time... what may not happen in a year? Ha ha!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you've come in a racing droshky, take her to Mavriky Nikolaevitch\r\nnow.","She said just now that she could not endure me and would leave me,\r\nand she certainly will not accept my carriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Can she really be leaving? How can this have come about?\" said\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch, staring stupidly at him.\r\n\r\n\"She's guessed somehow during this night that I don't love her... which\r\nshe knew all along, indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But don't you love her?\" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, with an expression\r\nof extreme surprise.","\"If so, why did you keep her when she came to you\r\nyesterday, instead of telling her plainly like an honourable man that\r\nyou didn't care for her? That was horribly shabby on your part; and how\r\nmean you make me look in her eyes!\"\r\n\r\nStavrogin suddenly laughed.\r\n\r\n\"I am laughing at my monkey,\" he explained at once.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! You saw that I was putting it on!\" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch,\r\nlaughing too, with great enjoyment.","\"I did it to amuse you! Only fancy,\r\nas soon as you came out to me I guessed from your face that you'd been\r\n'unlucky.' A complete fiasco, perhaps. Eh? There! I'll bet anything,\"\r\nhe cried, almost gasping with delight, \"that you've been sitting side by\r\nside in the drawing-room all night wasting your precious time discussing\r\nsomething lofty and elevated.... There, forgive me, forgive me; it's not\r\nmy business.","I felt sure yesterday that it would all end in foolishness.\r\nI brought her to you simply to amuse you, and to show you that you\r\nwouldn't have a dull time with me. I shall be of use to you a hundred\r\ntimes in that way. I always like pleasing people. If you don't want her\r\nnow, which was what I was reckoning on when I came, then...\"\r\n\r\n\"So you brought her simply for my amusement?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to make me kill my wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come.","You've not killed her? What a tragic fellow you are!\r\n\r\n\"It's just the same; you killed her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't kill her! I tell you I had no hand in it.... You are beginning\r\nto make me uneasy, though....\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on. You said, 'if you don't want her now, then... '\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, leave it to me, of course. I can quite easily marry her off to\r\nMavriky Nikolaevitch, though I didn't make him sit down by the fence.","Don't take that notion into your head. I am afraid of him, now. You talk\r\nabout my droshky, but I simply dashed by.... What if he has a revolver?\r\nIt's a good thing I brought mine. Here it is.\" He brought a revolver out\r\nof his pocket, showed it, and hid it again at once. \"I took it as I\r\nwas coming such a long way.... But I'll arrange all that for you in a\r\ntwinkling: her little heart is aching at this moment for Mavriky; it\r\nshould be, anyway.","... And, do you know, I am really rather sorry for\r\nher? If I take her to Mavriky she will begin about you directly; she\r\nwill praise you to him and abuse him to his face. You know the heart of\r\nwoman! There you are, laughing again! I am awfully glad that you are so\r\ncheerful now. Come, let's go. I'll begin with Mavriky right away, and\r\nabout them... those who've been murdered... hadn't we better keep quiet\r\nnow? She'll hear later on, anyway.","\"\r\n\r\n\"What will she hear? Who's been murdered? What were you saying about\r\nMavriky Nikolaevitch?\" said Liza, suddenly opening the door.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! You've been listening?\"\r\n\r\n\"What were you saying just now about Mavriky Nikolaevitch? Has he been\r\nmurdered?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Then you didn't hear? Don't distress yourself, Mavriky Nikolaevitch\r\nis alive and well, and you can satisfy yourself of it in an instant,\r\nfor he is here by the wayside, by the garden fence.",".. and I believe he's\r\nbeen sitting there all night. He is drenched through in his greatcoat!\r\nHe saw me as I drove past.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not true. You said 'murdered.'... Who's been murdered?\" she\r\ninsisted with agonising mistrust.\r\n\r\n\"The only people who have been murdered are my wife, her brother\r\nLebyadkin, and their servant,\" Stavrogin brought out firmly.\r\n\r\nLiza trembled and turned terribly pale.","\"A strange brutal outrage, Lizaveta Nikolaevna. A simple case of\r\nrobbery,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch rattled off at once \"Simply robbery, under\r\ncover of the fire. The crime was committed by Fedka the convict, and it\r\nwas all that fool Lebyadkin's fault for showing every one his\r\nmoney.... I rushed here with the news... it fell on me like a\r\nthunderbolt. Stavrogin could hardly stand when I told him. We were\r\ndeliberating here whether to tell you at once or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, is he telling the truth?\" Liza articulated\r\nfaintly.","\"No; it's false.\"\r\n\r\n\"False?\" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, starting. \"What do you mean by that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Heavens! I shall go mad!\" cried Liza.\r\n\r\n\"Do you understand, anyway, that he is mad now!\" Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\ncried at the top of his voice. \"After all, his wife has just been\r\nmurdered. You see how white he is.... Why, he has been with you the\r\nwhole night. He hasn't left your side a minute. How can you suspect\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, tell me, as before God, are you guilty or not,\r\nand I swear I'll believe your word as though it were God's, and I'll\r\nfollow you to the end of the earth.","Yes, I will. I'll follow you like a\r\ndog.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are you tormenting her, you fantastic creature?\" cried Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch in exasperation. \"Lizaveta Nikolaevna, upon my oath, you\r\ncan crush me into powder, but he is not guilty. On the contrary, it has\r\ncrushed him, and he is raving, you see that. He is not to blame in\r\nany way, not in any way, not even in thought!... It's all the work of\r\nrobbers who will probably be found within a week and flogged.","... It's\r\nall the work of Fedka the convict, and some Shpigulin men, all the town\r\nis agog with it. That's why I say so too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that right? Is that right?\" Liza waited trembling for her final\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n\"I did not kill them, and I was against it, but I knew they were\r\ngoing to be killed and I did not stop the murderers. Leave me, Liza,\"\r\nStavrogin brought out, and he walked into the drawing-room.","Liza hid her face in her hands and walked out of the house. Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch was rushing after her, but at once hurried back and went\r\ninto the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\"So that's your line? That's your line? So there's nothing you are\r\nafraid of?\" He flew at Stavrogin in an absolute fury, muttering\r\nincoherently, scarcely able to find words and foaming at the mouth.\r\n\r\nStavrogin stood in the middle of the room and did not answer a word.","He clutched a lock of his hair in his left hand and smiled helplessly.\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch pulled him violently by the sleeve.\r\n\r\n\"Is it all over with you? So that's the line you are taking? You'll\r\ninform against all of us, and go to a monastery yourself, or to the\r\ndevil.... But I'll do for you, though you are not afraid of me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! That's you chattering!\" said Stavrogin, noticing him at last.","\"Run,\" he said, coming to himself suddenly, \"run after her, order the\r\ncarriage, don't leave her.... Run, run! Take her home so that no one\r\nmay know... and that she mayn't go there... to the bodies... to the\r\nbodies.... Force her to get into the carriage... Alexey Yegorytch!\r\nAlexey Yegorytch!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay, don't shout! By now she is in Mavriky's arms.... Mavriky won't\r\nput her into your carriage..",".. Stay! There's something more important\r\nthan the carriage!\"\r\n\r\nHe seized his revolver again. Stavrogin looked at him gravely.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, kill me,\" he said softly, almost conciliatorily.\r\n\r\n\"Foo. Damn it! What a maze of false sentiment a man can get into!\" said\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch, shaking with rage. \"Yes, really, you ought to be\r\nkilled! She ought simply to spit at you! Fine sort of 'magic boat,'\r\nyou are; you are a broken-down, leaky old hulk!.",".. You ought to pull\r\nyourself together if only from spite! Ech! Why, what difference would it\r\nmake to you since you ask for a bullet through your brains yourself?\"\r\n\r\nStavrogin smiled strangely.\r\n\r\n\"If you were not such a buffoon I might perhaps have said yes now.... If\r\nyou had only a grain of sense...\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a buffoon, but I don't want you, my better half, to be one! Do you\r\nunderstand me?\"\r\n\r\nStavrogin did understand, though perhaps no one else did.","Shatov, for\r\ninstance, was astonished when Stavrogin told him that Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\nhad enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"Go to the devil now, and to-morrow perhaps I may wring something out of\r\nmyself. Come to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes? Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell?... Go to hell. Go to hell.\" And he walked out of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps, after all, it may be for the best,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\nmuttered to himself as he hid the revolver.","III\r\n\r\nHe rushed off to overtake Lizaveta Nikolaevna. She had not got far\r\naway, only a few steps, from the house. She had been detained by Alexey\r\nYegorytch, who was following a step behind her, in a tail coat, and\r\nwithout a hat; his head was bowed respectfully. He was persistently\r\nentreating her to wait for a carriage; the old man was alarmed and\r\nalmost in tears.\r\n\r\n\"Go along. Your master is asking for tea, and there's no one to give it\r\nto him,\" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, pushing him away.","He took Liza's arm.\r\n\r\nShe did not pull her arm away, but she seemed hardly to know what she\r\nwas doing; she was still dazed.\r\n\r\n\"To begin with, you are going the wrong way,\" babbled Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch. \"We ought to go this way, and not by the garden, and,\r\nsecondly, walking is impossible in any case. It's over two miles, and\r\nyou are not properly dressed. If you would wait a second, I came in a\r\ndroshky; the horse is in the yard.","I'll get it instantly, put you in,\r\nand get you home so that no one sees you.\"\r\n\r\n\"How kind you are,\" said Liza graciously.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, not at all. Any humane man in my position would do the same....\"\r\n\r\nLiza looked at him, and was surprised.\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens! Why I thought it was that old man here still.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen. I am awfully glad that you take it like this, because it's\r\nall such a frightfully stupid convention, and since it's come to that,\r\nhadn't I better tell the old man to get the carriage at once.","It's only\r\na matter of ten minutes and we'll turn back and wait in the porch, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want first... where are those murdered people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! What next? That was what I was afraid of.... No, we'd better leave\r\nthose wretched creatures alone; it's no use your looking at them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know where they are. I know that house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well? What if you do know it? Come; it's raining, and there's a fog.\r\n(A nice job this sacred duty I've taken upon myself.",") Listen, Lizaveta\r\nNikolaevna! It's one of two alternatives. Either you come with me in the\r\ndroshky--in that case wait here, and don't take another step, for if we\r\ngo another twenty steps we must be seen by Mavriky Nikolaevitch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mavriky Nikolaevitch! Where? Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you want to go with him, I'll take you a little farther, if\r\nyou like, and show you where he sits, but I don't care to go up to him\r\njust now.","No, thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is waiting for me. Good God!\" she suddenly stopped, and a flush of\r\ncolour flooded her face.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Come now. If he is an unconventional man! You know, Lizaveta\r\nNikolaevna, it's none of my business. I am a complete outsider, and you\r\nknow that yourself. But, still, I wish you well.... If your 'fairy boat'\r\nhas failed you, if it has turned out to be nothing more than a rotten\r\nold hulk, only fit to be chopped up.","..\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! That's fine, that's lovely,\" cried Liza.\r\n\r\n\"Lovely, and yet your tears are falling. You must have spirit. You must\r\nbe as good as a man in every way. In our age, when woman.... Foo, hang\r\nit,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch was on the point of spitting. \"And the chief\r\npoint is that there is nothing to regret. It may all turn out for the\r\nbest. Mavriky Nikolaevitch is a man.... In fact, he is a man of feeling\r\nthough not talkative, but that's a good thing, too, as long as he has no\r\nconventional notions, of course.","...\"\r\n\r\n\"Lovely, lovely!\" Liza laughed hysterically.\r\n\r\n\"Well, hang it all... Lizaveta Nikolaevna,\" said Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\nsuddenly piqued. \"I am simply here on your account.... It's nothing to\r\nme.... I helped you yesterday when you wanted it yourself. To-day ...\r\nwell, you can see Mavriky Nikolaevitch from here; there he's sitting; he\r\ndoesn't see us. I say, Lizaveta Nikolaevna, have you ever read 'Polenka\r\nSaxe'?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the name of a novel, 'Polenka Saxe.","' I read it when I was a\r\nstudent.... In it a very wealthy official of some sort, Saxe, arrested\r\nhis wife at a summer villa for infidelity.... But, hang it; it's no\r\nconsequence! You'll see, Mavriky Nikolaevitch will make you an offer\r\nbefore you get home. He doesn't see us yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ach! Don't let him see us!\" Liza cried suddenly, like a mad creature.\r\n\"Come away, come away! To the woods, to the fields!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she ran back.","\"Lizaveta Nikolaevna, this is such cowardice,\" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch,\r\nrunning after her. \"And why don't you want him to see you? On the\r\ncontrary, you must look him straight in the face, with pride.... If it's\r\nsome feeling about that... some maidenly... that's such a prejudice, so\r\nout of date... But where are you going? Where are you going? Ech! she is\r\nrunning! Better go back to Stavrogin's and take my droshky.","... Where are\r\nyou going? That's the way to the fields! There! She's fallen down!...\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped. Liza was flying along like a bird, not conscious where she\r\nwas going, and Pyotr Stepanovitch was already fifty paces behind her.\r\nShe stumbled over a mound of earth and fell down. At the same moment\r\nthere was the sound of a terrible shout from behind. It came from\r\nMavriky Nikolaevitch, who had seen her flight and her fall, and was\r\nrunning to her across the field.","In a flash Pyotr Stepanovitch had\r\nretired into Stavrogin's gateway to make haste and get into his droshky.\r\n\r\nMavriky Nikolaevitch was already standing in terrible alarm by Liza, who\r\nhad risen to her feet; he was bending over her and holding her hands in\r\nboth of his. All the incredible surroundings of this meeting overwhelmed\r\nhim, and tears were rolling down his cheeks. He saw the woman for whom\r\nhe had such reverent devotion running madly across the fields, at such\r\nan hour, in such weather, with nothing over her dress, the gay dress she\r\nwore the day before now crumpled and muddy from her fall.","... He could\r\nnot utter a word; he took off his greatcoat, and with trembling hands\r\nput it round her shoulders. Suddenly he uttered a cry, feeling that she\r\nhad pressed her lips to his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Liza,\" he cried, \"I am no good for anything, but don't drive me away\r\nfrom you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no! Let us make haste away from here. Don't leave me!\" and, seizing\r\nhis hand, she drew him after her. \"Mavriky Nikolaevitch,\" she suddenly\r\ndropped her voice timidly, \"I kept a bold face there all the time, but\r\nnow I am afraid of death.","I shall die soon, very soon, but I am afraid,\r\nI am afraid to die....\" she whispered, pressing his hand tight.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if there were someone,\" he looked round in despair. \"Some\r\npasser-by! You will get your feet wet, you... will lose your reason!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all right; it's all right,\" she tried to reassure him. \"That's\r\nright. I am not so frightened with you. Hold my hand, lead me.... Where\r\nare we going now? Home? No! I want first to see the people who have been\r\nmurdered.","His wife has been murdered they say, and he says he killed\r\nher himself. But that's not true, is it? I want to see for myself those\r\nthree who've been killed... on my account... it's because of them his\r\nlove for me has grown cold since last night.... I shall see and find out\r\neverything. Make haste, make haste, I know the house... there's a fire\r\nthere.... Mavriky Nikolaevitch, my dear one, don't forgive me in my\r\nshame! Why forgive me? Why are you crying? Give me a blow and kill me\r\nhere in the field, like a dog!\"\r\n\r\n\"No one is your judge now,\" Mavriky Nikolaevitch pronounced firmly.","\"God\r\nforgive you. I least of all can be your judge.\"\r\n\r\nBut it would be strange to describe their conversation. And meanwhile\r\nthey walked hand in hand quickly, hurrying as though they were crazy.\r\nThey were going straight towards the fire. Mavriky Nikolaevitch still\r\nhad hopes of meeting a cart at least, but no one came that way. A mist\r\nof fine, drizzling rain enveloped the whole country, swallowing up every\r\nray of light, every gleam of colour, and transforming everything into\r\none smoky, leaden, indistinguishable mass.","It had long been daylight,\r\nyet it seemed as though it were still night. And suddenly in this cold\r\nfoggy mist there appeared coming towards them a strange and absurd\r\nfigure. Picturing it now I think I should not have believed my eyes if\r\nI had been in Lizaveta Nikolaevna's place, yet she uttered a cry of\r\njoy, and recognised the approaching figure at once. It was Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch. How he had gone off, how the insane, impracticable idea\r\nof his flight came to be carried out, of that later.","I will only mention\r\nthat he was in a fever that morning, yet even illness did not prevent\r\nhis starting. He was walking resolutely on the damp ground. It was\r\nevident that he had planned the enterprise to the best of his ability,\r\nalone with his inexperience and lack of practical sense. He wore\r\n\"travelling dress,\" that is, a greatcoat with a wide patent-leather\r\nbelt, fastened with a buckle and a pair of new high boots pulled over\r\nhis trousers.","Probably he had for some time past pictured a traveller as\r\nlooking like this, and the belt and the high boots with the shining tops\r\nlike a hussar's, in which he could hardly walk, had been ready some time\r\nbefore. A broad-brimmed hat, a knitted scarf, twisted close round his\r\nneck, a stick in his right hand, and an exceedingly small but extremely\r\ntightly packed bag in his left, completed his get-up.","He had, besides,\r\nin the same right hand, an open umbrella. These three objects--the\r\numbrella, the stick, and the bag--had been very awkward to carry for the\r\nfirst mile, and had begun to be heavy by the second.\r\n\r\n\"Can it really be you?\" cried Liza, looking at him with distressed\r\nwonder, after her first rush of instinctive gladness.\r\n\r\n_\"Lise,\"_ cried Stepan Trofimovitch, rushing to her almost in delirium too.","\"_Ch√®re, ch√®re_.... Can you be out, too... in such a fog? You see the glow\r\nof fire. _Vous √™tes malheureuse, n'est-ce pas?_ I see, I see. Don't tell\r\nme, but don't question me either. _Nous sommes tous malheureux mais il\r\nfaut les pardonner tous. Pardonnons, Lise,_ and let us be free forever.\r\nTo be quit of the world and be completely free. _Il faut pardonner,\r\npardonner, et pardonner!\"_\r\n\r\n\"But why are you kneeling down?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, taking leave of the world, I want to take leave of all my past\r\nin your person!\" He wept and raised both her hands to his tear-stained\r\neyes.","\"I kneel to all that was beautiful in my life. I kiss and give\r\nthanks! Now I've torn myself in half; left behind a mad visionary who\r\ndreamed of soaring to the sky. _Vingt-deux ans,_ here. A shattered, frozen\r\nold man. A tutor _chez ce marchand, s'il existe pourtant ce\r\nmarchand...._ But how drenched you are, _Lise!\"_ he cried, jumping on to\r\nhis feet, feeling that his knees too were soaked by the wet earth.","\"And\r\nhow is it possible... you are in such a dress... and on foot, and in\r\nthese fields?... You are crying! _Vous √™tes malheureuse._ Bah, I did hear\r\nsomething.... But where have you come from now?\" He asked hurried\r\nquestions with an uneasy air, looking in extreme bewilderment at Mavriky\r\nNikolaevitch. _\"Mais savez-vous l'heure qu'il est?\"_\r\n\r\n\"Stepan Trofimovitch, have you heard anything about the people who've\r\nbeen murdered?.",".. Is it true? Is it true?\"\r\n\r\n\"These people! I saw the glow of their work all night. They were bound\r\nto end in this....\" His eyes flashed again. \"I am fleeing away from\r\nmadness, from a delirious dream. I am fleeing away to seek for Russia.\r\n_Existe-t-elle, la Russie? Bah! C'est vous, cher capitaine!_\r\nI've never doubted that I should meet you somewhere on some high\r\nadventure.... But take my umbrella, and--why must you be on foot? For\r\nGod's sake, do at least take my umbrella, for I shall hire a carriage\r\nsomewhere in any case.","I am on foot because Stasie (I mean, Nastasya)\r\nwould have shouted for the benefit of the whole street if she'd found out\r\nI was going away. So I slipped away as far as possible incognito. I don't\r\nknow; in the _Voice_ they write of there being brigands everywhere, but I\r\nthought surely I shouldn't meet a brigand the moment I came out on the\r\nroad. _Ch√®re Lise,_ I thought you said something of someone's being\r\nmurdered.","_Oh, mon Dieu!_ You are ill!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along, come along!\" cried Liza, almost in hysterics, drawing\r\nMavriky Nikolaevitch after her again. \"Wait a minute, Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch!\" she came back suddenly to him. \"Stay, poor darling, let\r\nme sign you with the cross. Perhaps, it would be better to put you under\r\ncontrol, but I'd rather make the sign of the cross over you. You, too,\r\npray for 'poor' Liza--just a little, don't bother too much about it.","Mavriky Nikolaevitch, give that baby back his umbrella. You must give it\r\nhim. That's right.... Come, let us go, let us go!\"\r\n\r\nThey reached the fatal house at the very moment when the huge crowd,\r\nwhich had gathered round it, had already heard a good deal of Stavrogin,\r\nand of how much it was to his interest to murder his wife. Yet, I\r\nrepeat, the immense majority went on listening without moving or\r\nuttering a word.","The only people who were excited were bawling drunkards\r\nand excitable individuals of the same sort as the gesticulatory\r\ncabinet-maker. Every one knew the latter as a man really of mild\r\ndisposition, but he was liable on occasion to get excited and to fly off\r\nat a tangent if anything struck him in a certain way. I did not see\r\nLiza and Mavriky Nikolaevitch arrive. Petrified with amazement, I first\r\nnoticed Liza some distance away in the crowd, and I did not at once\r\ncatch sight of Mavriky Nikolaevitch.","I fancy there was a moment when\r\nhe fell two or three steps behind her or was pressed back by the crush.\r\nLiza, forcing her way through the crowd, seeing and noticing nothing\r\nround her, like one in a delirium, like a patient escaped from a\r\nhospital, attracted attention only too quickly, of course. There arose\r\na hubbub of loud talking and at last sudden shouts. Some one bawled out,\r\n\"It's Stavrogin's woman!\" And on the other side, \"It's not enough to\r\nmurder them, she wants to look at them!\" All at once I saw an arm raised\r\nabove her head from behind and suddenly brought down upon it.","Liza fell\r\nto the ground. We heard a fearful scream from Mavriky Nikolaevitch as\r\nhe dashed to her assistance and struck with all his strength the man who\r\nstood between him and Liza. But at that instant the same cabinetmaker\r\nseized him with both arms from behind. For some minutes nothing could be\r\ndistinguished in the scrimmage that followed. I believe Liza got up but\r\nwas knocked down by another blow.","Suddenly the crowd parted and a\r\nsmall space was left empty round Liza's prostrate figure, and Mavriky\r\nNikolaevitch, frantic with grief and covered with blood, was standing\r\nover her, screaming, weeping, and wringing his hands. I don't remember\r\nexactly what followed after; I only remember that they began to carry\r\nLiza away. I ran after her. She was still alive and perhaps still\r\nconscious. The cabinet-maker and three other men in the crowd were\r\nseized.","These three still deny having taken any part in the dastardly\r\ndeed, stubbornly maintaining that they have been arrested by mistake.\r\nPerhaps it's the truth. Though the evidence against the cabinet-maker\r\nis clear, he is so irrational that he is still unable to explain what\r\nhappened coherently. I too, as a spectator, though at some distance,\r\nhad to give evidence at the inquest. I declared that it had all happened\r\nentirely accidentally through the action of men perhaps moved by\r\nill-feeling, yet scarcely conscious of what they were doing--drunk and\r\nirresponsible.","I am of that opinion to this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. THE LAST RESOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHAT MORNING MANY people saw Pyotr Stepanovitch. All who saw him\r\nremembered that he was in a particularly excited state. At two o'clock\r\nhe went to see Gaganov, who had arrived from the country only the day\r\nbefore, and whose house was full of visitors hotly discussing the events\r\nof the previous day. Pyotr Stepanovitch talked more than anyone and made\r\nthem listen to him.","He was always considered among us as a \"chatterbox\r\nof a student with a screw loose,\" but now he talked of Yulia Mihailovna,\r\nand in the general excitement the theme was an enthralling one. As one\r\nwho had recently been her intimate and confidential friend, he disclosed\r\nmany new and unexpected details concerning her; incidentally (and of\r\ncourse unguardedly) he repeated some of her own remarks about persons\r\nknown to all in the town, and thereby piqued their vanity.","He dropped\r\nit all in a vague and rambling way, like a man free from guile driven\r\nby his sense of honour to the painful necessity of clearing up a perfect\r\nmountain of misunderstandings, and so simple-hearted that he hardly knew\r\nwhere to begin and where to leave off. He let slip in a rather unguarded\r\nway, too, that Yulia Mihailovna knew the whole secret of Stavrogin and\r\nthat she had been at the bottom of the whole intrigue.","She had taken\r\nhim in too, for he, Pyotr Stepanovitch, had also been in love with this\r\nunhappy Liza, yet he had been so hoodwinked that he had _almost_ taken her\r\nto Stavrogin himself in the carriage. \"Yes, yes, it's all very well\r\nfor you to laugh, gentlemen, but if only I'd known, if I'd known how it\r\nwould end!\" he concluded. To various excited inquiries about Stavrogin\r\nhe bluntly replied that in his opinion the catastrophe to the Lebyadkins\r\nwas a pure coincidence, and that it was all Lebyadkin's own fault for\r\ndisplaying his money.","He explained this particularly well. One of his\r\nlisteners observed that it was no good his \"pretending\"; that he had\r\neaten and drunk and almost slept at Yulia Mihailovna's, yet now he was\r\nthe first to blacken her character, and that this was by no means such\r\na fine thing to do as he supposed. But Pyotr Stepanovitch immediately\r\ndefended himself.\r\n\r\n\"I ate and drank there not because I had no money, and it's not my fault\r\nthat I was invited there.","Allow me to judge for myself how far I need to\r\nbe grateful for that.\"\r\n\r\nThe general impression was in his favour. \"He may be rather absurd, and\r\nof course he is a nonsensical fellow, yet still he is not responsible\r\nfor Yulia Mihailovna's foolishness. On the contrary, it appears that he\r\ntried to stop her.\"\r\n\r\nAbout two o'clock the news suddenly came that Stavrogin, about whom\r\nthere was so much talk, had suddenly left for Petersburg by the midday\r\ntrain.","This interested people immensely; many of them frowned. Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch was so much struck that I was told he turned quite pale and\r\ncried out strangely, \"Why, how could they have let him go?\" He hurried\r\naway from Gaganov's forthwith, yet he was seen in two or three other\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nTowards dusk he succeeded in getting in to see Yulia Mihailovna though\r\nhe had the greatest pains to do so, as she had absolutely refused to see\r\nhim.","I heard of this from the lady herself only three weeks afterwards,\r\njust before her departure for Petersburg. She gave me no details, but\r\nobserved with a shudder that \"he had on that occasion astounded her\r\nbeyond all belief.\" I imagine that all he did was to terrify her\r\nby threatening to charge her with being an accomplice if she \"said\r\nanything.\" The necessity for this intimidation arose from his plans at\r\nthe moment, of which she, of course, knew nothing; and only later,\r\nfive days afterwards, she guessed why he had been so doubtful of her\r\nreticence and so afraid of a new outburst of indignation on her part.","Between seven and eight o'clock, when it was dark, all the five members\r\nof the quintet met together at Ensign Erkel's lodgings in a little\r\ncrooked house at the end of the town. The meeting had been fixed by\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch himself, but he was unpardonably late, and the\r\nmembers waited over an hour for him. This Ensign Erkel was that young\r\nofficer who had sat the whole evening at Virginsky's with a pencil in\r\nhis hand and a notebook before him.","He had not long been in the town;\r\nhe lodged alone with two old women, sisters, in a secluded by-street and\r\nwas shortly to leave the town; a meeting at his house was less likely\r\nto attract notice than anywhere. This strange boy was distinguished by\r\nextreme taciturnity: he was capable of sitting for a dozen evenings in\r\nsuccession in noisy company, with the most extraordinary conversation\r\ngoing on around him, without uttering a word, though he listened with\r\nextreme attention, watching the speakers with his childlike eyes.","His\r\nface was very pretty and even had a certain look of cleverness. He did\r\nnot belong to the quintet; it was supposed that he had some special job\r\nof a purely practical character. It is known now that he had nothing of\r\nthe sort and probably did not understand his position himself. It was\r\nsimply that he was filled with hero-worship for Pyotr Stepanovitch,\r\nwhom he had only lately met. If he had met a monster of iniquity who had\r\nincited him to found a band of brigands on the pretext of some romantic\r\nand socialistic object, and as a test had bidden him rob and murder the\r\nfirst peasant he met, he would certainly have obeyed and done it.","He had\r\nan invalid mother to whom he sent half of his scanty pay--and how\r\nshe must have kissed that poor little flaxen head, how she must have\r\ntrembled and prayed over it! I go into these details about him because I\r\nfeel very sorry for him.\r\n\r\n\"Our fellows\" were excited. The events of the previous night had made a\r\ngreat impression on them, and I fancy they were in a panic. The simple\r\ndisorderliness in which they had so zealously and systematically taken\r\npart had ended in a way they had not expected.","The fire in the night,\r\nthe murder of the Lebyadkins, the savage brutality of the crowd with\r\nLiza, had been a series of surprises which they had not anticipated in\r\ntheir programme. They hotly accused the hand that had guided them of\r\ndespotism and duplicity. In fact, while they were waiting for Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch they worked each other up to such a point that they\r\nresolved again to ask him for a definite explanation, and if he evaded\r\nagain, as he had done before, to dissolve the quintet and to found\r\ninstead a new secret society \"for the propaganda of ideas\" and on\r\ntheir own initiative on the basis of democracy and equality.","Liputin,\r\nShigalov, and the authority on the peasantry supported this plan;\r\nLyamshin said nothing, though he looked approving. Virginsky hesitated\r\nand wanted to hear Pyotr Stepanovitch first. It was decided to hear\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch, but still he did not come; such casualness added\r\nfuel to the flames. Erkel was absolutely silent and did nothing but\r\norder the tea, which he brought from his landladies in glasses on a\r\ntray, not bringing in the samovar nor allowing the servant to enter.","Pyotr Stepanovitch did not turn up till half-past eight. With rapid\r\nsteps he went up to the circular table before the sofa round which the\r\ncompany were seated; he kept his cap in his hand and refused tea. He\r\nlooked angry, severe, and supercilious. He must have observed at once\r\nfrom their faces that they were \"mutinous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before I open my mouth, you've got something hidden; out with it.\"\r\n\r\nLiputin began \"in the name of all,\" and declared in a voice quivering\r\nwith resentment \"that if things were going on like that they might as\r\nwell blow their brains out.","\" Oh, they were not at all afraid to blow\r\ntheir brains out, they were quite ready to, in fact, but only to serve\r\nthe common cause (a general movement of approbation). So he must be more\r\nopen with them so that they might always know beforehand, \"or else what\r\nwould things be coming to?\" (Again a stir and some guttural sounds.) To\r\nbehave like this was humiliating and dangerous. \"We don't say so because\r\nwe are afraid, but if one acts and the rest are only pawns, then one\r\nwould blunder and all would be lost.","\" (Exclamations. \"Yes, yes.\" General\r\napproval.)\r\n\r\n\"Damn it all, what do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"What connection is there between the common cause and the petty\r\nintrigues of Mr. Stavrogin?\" cried Liputin, boiling over. \"Suppose he\r\nis in some mysterious relation to the centre, if that legendary centre\r\nreally exists at all, it's no concern of ours. And meantime a murder has\r\nbeen committed, the police have been roused; if they follow the thread\r\nthey may find what it starts from.","\"\r\n\r\n\"If Stavrogin and you are caught, we shall be caught too,\" added the\r\nauthority on the peasantry.\r\n\r\n\"And to no good purpose for the common cause,\" Virginsky concluded\r\ndespondently.\r\n\r\n\"What nonsense! The murder is a chance crime; it was committed by Fedka\r\nfor the sake of robbery.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm! Strange coincidence, though,\" said Liputin, wriggling.\r\n\r\n\"And if you will have it, it's all through you.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Through us?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, you, Liputin, had a share in the intrigue yourself;\r\nand the second chief point is, you were ordered to get Lebyadkin away\r\nand given money to do it; and what did you do? If you'd got him away\r\nnothing would have happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"But wasn't it you yourself who suggested the idea that it would be a\r\ngood thing to set him on to read his verses?\"\r\n\r\n\"An idea is not a command.","The command was to get him away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Command! Rather a queer word.... On the contrary, your orders were to\r\ndelay sending him off.\"\r\n\r\n\"You made a mistake and showed your foolishness and self-will. The\r\nmurder was the work of Fedka, and he carried it out alone for the sake\r\nof robbery. You heard the gossip and believed it. You were scared.\r\nStavrogin is not such a fool, and the proof of that is he left the town\r\nat twelve o'clock after an interview with the vice-governor; if there\r\nwere anything in it they would not let him go to Petersburg in broad\r\ndaylight.","\"\r\n\r\n\"But we are not making out that Mr. Stavrogin committed the murder\r\nhimself,\" Liputin rejoined spitefully and unceremoniously. \"He may have\r\nknown nothing about it, like me; and you know very well that I knew\r\nnothing about it, though I am mixed up in it like mutton in a hash.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom are you accusing?\" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, looking at him darkly.\r\n\r\n\"Those whose interest it is to burn down towns.","\"\r\n\r\n\"You make matters worse by wriggling out of it. However, won't you read\r\nthis and pass it to the others, simply as a fact of interest?\"\r\n\r\nHe pulled out of his pocket Lebyadkin's anonymous letter to Lembke and\r\nhanded it to Liputin. The latter read it, was evidently surprised, and\r\npassed it thoughtfully to his neighbour; the letter quickly went the\r\nround.\r\n\r\n\"Is that really Lebyadkin's handwriting?\" observed Shigalov.","\"It is,\" answered Liputin and Tolkatchenko (the authority on the\r\npeasantry).\r\n\r\n\"I simply brought it as a fact of interest and because I knew you were\r\nso sentimental over Lebyadkin,\" repeated Pyotr Stepanovitch, taking the\r\nletter back. \"So it turns out, gentlemen, that a stray Fedka relieves us\r\nquite by chance of a dangerous man. That's what chance does sometimes!\r\nIt's instructive, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\nThe members exchanged rapid glances.","\"And now, gentlemen, it's my turn to ask questions,\" said Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch, assuming an air of dignity. \"Let me know what business you\r\nhad to set fire to the town without permission.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's this! We, we set fire to the town? That is laying the blame on\r\nothers!\" they exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"I quite understand that you carried the game too far,\" Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch persisted stubbornly, \"but it's not a matter of petty\r\nscandals with Yulia Mihailovna.","I've brought you here gentlemen,\r\nto explain to you the greatness of the danger you have so stupidly\r\nincurred, which is a menace to much besides yourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, we, on the contrary, were intending just now to point out\r\nto you the greatness of the despotism and unfairness you have shown\r\nin taking such a serious and also strange step without consulting the\r\nmembers,\" Virginsky, who had been hitherto silent, protested, almost\r\nwith indignation.","\"And so you deny it? But I maintain that you set fire to the town, you\r\nand none but you. Gentlemen, don't tell lies! I have good evidence. By\r\nyour rashness you exposed the common cause to danger. You are only one\r\nknot in an endless network of knots--and your duty is blind obedience to\r\nthe centre. Yet three men of you incited the Shpigulin men to set fire\r\nto the town without the least instruction to do so, and the fire has\r\ntaken place.","\"\r\n\r\n\"What three? What three of us?\"\r\n\r\n\"The day before yesterday, at three o'clock in the night, you,\r\nTolkatchenko, were inciting Fomka Zavyalov at the 'Forget-me-not.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word!\" cried the latter, jumping up, \"I scarcely said a word\r\nto him, and what I did say was without intention, simply because he had\r\nbeen flogged that morning. And I dropped it at once; I saw he was too\r\ndrunk. If you had not referred to it I should not have thought of it\r\nagain.","A word could not set the place on fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are like a man who should be surprised that a tiny spark could blow\r\na whole powder magazine into the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"I spoke in a whisper in his ear, in a corner; how could you have heard\r\nof it?\"\r\n\r\nTolkatchenko reflected suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"I was sitting there under the table. Don't disturb yourselves,\r\ngentlemen; I know every step you take. You smile sarcastically, Mr.","Liputin? But I know, for instance, that you pinched your wife black and\r\nblue at midnight, three days ago, in your bedroom as you were going to\r\nbed.\"\r\n\r\nLiputin's mouth fell open and he turned pale. (It was afterwards found\r\nout that he knew of this exploit of Liputin's from Agafya, Liputin's\r\nservant, whom he had paid from the beginning to spy on him; this only\r\ncame out later.)\r\n\r\n\"May I state a fact?\" said Shigalov, getting up.","\"State it.\"\r\n\r\nShigalov sat down and pulled himself together.\r\n\r\n\"So far as I understand--and it's impossible not to understand it--you\r\nyourself at first and a second time later, drew with great eloquence,\r\nbut too theoretically, a picture of Russia covered with an endless\r\nnetwork of knots. Each of these centres of activity, proselytising\r\nand ramifying endlessly, aims by systematic denunciation to injure the\r\nprestige of local authority, to reduce the villages to confusion,\r\nto spread cynicism and scandals, together with complete disbelief in\r\neverything and an eagerness for something better, and finally, by means\r\nof fires, as a pre-eminently national method, to reduce the country at\r\na given moment, if need be, to desperation.","Are those your words which\r\nI tried to remember accurately? Is that the programme you gave us as the\r\nauthorised representative of the central committee, which is to this day\r\nutterly unknown to us and almost like a myth?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's correct, only you are very tedious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every one has a right to express himself in his own way. Giving us\r\nto understand that the separate knots of the general network already\r\ncovering Russia number by now several hundred, and propounding the\r\ntheory that if every one does his work successfully, all Russia at a\r\ngiven moment, at a signal.","..\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, damn it all, I have enough to do without you!\" cried Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch, twisting in his chair.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I'll cut it short and I'll end simply by asking if we've\r\nseen the disorderly scenes, we've seen the discontent of the people,\r\nwe've seen and taken part in the downfall of local administration, and\r\nfinally, we've seen with our own eyes the town on fire? What do you find\r\namiss? Isn't that your programme? What can you blame us for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Acting on your own initiative!\" Pyotr Stepanovitch cried furiously.","\"While I am here you ought not to have dared to act without my\r\npermission. Enough. We are on the eve of betrayal, and perhaps to-morrow\r\nor to-night you'll be seized. So there. I have authentic information.\"\r\n\r\nAt this all were agape with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"You will be arrested not only as the instigators of the fire, but as a\r\nquintet. The traitor knows the whole secret of the network. So you see\r\nwhat a mess you've made of it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stavrogin, no doubt,\" cried Liputin.","\"What... why Stavrogin?\" Pyotr Stepanovitch seemed suddenly taken aback.\r\n\"Hang it all,\" he cried, pulling himself together at once, \"it's Shatov!\r\nI believe you all know now that Shatov in his time was one of the\r\nsociety. I must tell you that, watching him through persons he does\r\nnot suspect, I found out to my amazement that he knows all about the\r\norganisation of the network and... everything, in fact.","To save\r\nhimself from being charged with having formerly belonged, he will give\r\ninformation against all. He has been hesitating up till now and I have\r\nspared him. Your fire has decided him: he is shaken and will hesitate\r\nno longer. To-morrow we shall be arrested as incendiaries and political\r\noffenders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it true? How does Shatov know?\" The excitement was indescribable.\r\n\r\n\"It's all perfectly true.","I have no right to reveal the source from\r\nwhich I learnt it or how I discovered it, but I tell you what I can\r\ndo for you meanwhile: through one person I can act on Shatov so that\r\nwithout his suspecting it he will put off giving information, but not\r\nmore than for twenty-four hours.\" All were silent.\r\n\r\n\"We really must send him to the devil!\" Tolkatchenko was the first to\r\nexclaim.\r\n\r\n\"It ought to have been done long ago,\" Lyamshin put in malignantly,\r\nstriking the table with his fist.","\"But how is it to be done?\" muttered Liputin. Pyotr Stepanovitch at once\r\ntook up the question and unfolded his plan. The plan was the following\r\nday at nightfall to draw Shatov away to a secluded spot to hand over\r\nthe secret printing press which had been in his keeping and was buried\r\nthere, and there \"to settle things.\" He went into various essential\r\ndetails which we will omit here, and explained minutely Shatov's present\r\nambiguous attitude to the central society, of which the reader knows\r\nalready.","\"That's all very well,\" Liputin observed irresolutely, \"but since it\r\nwill be another adventure... of the same sort... it will make too great\r\na sensation.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt,\" assented Pyotr Stepanovitch, \"but I've provided against\r\nthat. We have the means of averting suspicion completely.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with the same minuteness he told them about Kirillov, of his\r\nintention to shoot himself, and of his promise to wait for a signal from\r\nthem and to leave a letter behind him taking on himself anything they\r\ndictated to him (all of which the reader knows already).","\"His determination to take his own life--a philosophic, or as I should\r\ncall it, insane decision--has become known _there_\" Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\nwent on to explain. \"_There_ not a thread, not a grain of dust is\r\noverlooked; everything is turned to the service of the cause. Foreseeing\r\nhow useful it might be and satisfying themselves that his intention was\r\nquite serious, they had offered him the means to come to Russia (he was\r\nset for some reason on dying in Russia), gave him a commission which he\r\npromised to carry out (and he had done so), and had, moreover, bound him\r\nby a promise, as you already know, to commit suicide only when he was\r\ntold to.","He promised everything. You must note that he belongs to the\r\norganisation on a particular footing and is anxious to be of service;\r\nmore than that I can't tell you. To-morrow, _after Shatov's affair_, I'll\r\ndictate a note to him saying that he is responsible for his death. That\r\nwill seem very plausible: they were friends and travelled together to\r\nAmerica, there they quarrelled; and it will all be explained in the\r\nletter.",".. and... and perhaps, if it seems feasible, we might dictate\r\nsomething more to Kirillov--something about the manifestoes, for\r\ninstance, and even perhaps about the fire. But I'll think about\r\nthat. You needn't worry yourselves, he has no prejudices; he'll sign\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\nThere were expressions of doubt. It sounded a fantastic story. But they\r\nhad all heard more or less about Kirillov; Liputin more than all.","\"He may change his mind and not want to,\" said Shigalov; \"he is a madman\r\nanyway, so he is not much to build upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be uneasy, gentlemen, he will want to,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\nsnapped out. \"I am obliged by our agreement to give him warning the day\r\nbefore, so it must be to-day. I invite Liputin to go with me at once to\r\nsee him and make certain, and he will tell you, gentlemen, when he comes\r\nback--to-day if need be--whether what I say is true.","However,\" he broke\r\noff suddenly with intense exasperation, as though he suddenly felt he\r\nwas doing people like them too much honour by wasting time in persuading\r\nthem, \"however, do as you please. If you don't decide to do it,\r\nthe union is broken up--but solely through your insubordination and\r\ntreachery. In that case we are all independent from this moment. But\r\nunder those circumstances, besides the unpleasantness of Shatov's\r\nbetrayal and its consequences, you will have brought upon yourselves\r\nanother little unpleasantness of which you were definitely warned when\r\nthe union was formed.","As far as I am concerned, I am not much afraid of\r\nyou, gentlemen.... Don't imagine that I am so involved with you.... But\r\nthat's no matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we decide to do it,\" Liputin pronounced.\r\n\r\n\"There's no other way out of it,\" muttered Tolkatchenko, \"and if only\r\nLiputin confirms about Kirillov, then...\r\n\r\n\"I am against it; with all my soul and strength I protest against such a\r\nmurderous decision,\" said Virginsky, standing up.","\"But?\" asked Pyotr Stepanovitch....\r\n\r\n\"_But_ what?\"\r\n\r\n\"You said _but_... and I am waiting.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I did say _but_... I only meant to say that if you decide\r\nto do it, then...\"\r\n\r\n\"Then?\"\r\n\r\nVirginsky did not answer.\r\n\r\n\"I think that one is at liberty to neglect danger to one's own life,\"\r\nsaid Erkel, suddenly opening his mouth, \"but if it may injure the cause,\r\nthen I consider one ought not to dare to neglect danger to one's\r\nlife.","...\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off in confusion, blushing. Absorbed as they all were in their\r\nown ideas, they all looked at him in amazement--it was such a surprise\r\nthat he too could speak.\r\n\r\n\"I am for the cause,\" Virginsky pronounced suddenly.\r\n\r\nEvery one got up. It was decided to communicate once more and make final\r\narrangements at midday on the morrow, though without meeting. The place\r\nwhere the printing press was hidden was announced and each was assigned\r\nhis part and his duty.","Liputin and Pyotr Stepanovitch promptly set off\r\ntogether to Kirillov.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAll our fellows believed that Shatov was going to betray them; but they\r\nalso believed that Pyotr Stepanovitch was playing with them like pawns.\r\nAnd yet they knew, too, that in any case they would all meet on the spot\r\nnext day and that Shatov's fate was sealed. They suddenly felt like\r\nflies caught in a web by a huge spider; they were furious, but they were\r\ntrembling with terror.","Pyotr Stepanovitch, of course, had treated them badly; it might all have\r\ngone off far more harmoniously and easily if he had taken the trouble\r\nto embellish the facts ever so little. Instead of putting the facts in a\r\ndecorous light, as an exploit worthy of ancient Rome or something of the\r\nsort, he simply appealed to their animal fears and laid stress on the\r\ndanger to their own skins, which was simply insulting; of course there\r\nwas a struggle for existence in everything and there was no other\r\nprinciple in nature, they all knew that, but still.","...\r\n\r\nBut Pyotr Stepanovitch had no time to trot out the Romans; he was\r\ncompletely thrown out of his reckoning. Stavrogin's flight had astounded\r\nand crushed him. It was a lie when he said that Stavrogin had seen the\r\nvice-governor; what worried Pyotr Stepanovitch was that Stavrogin had\r\ngone off without seeing anyone, even his mother--and it was certainly\r\nstrange that he had been allowed to leave without hindrance.","(The authorities were called to account for it afterwards.) Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch had been making inquiries all day, but so far had found out\r\nnothing, and he had never been so upset. And how could he, how could he\r\ngive up Stavrogin all at once like this! That was why he could not\r\nbe very tender with the quintet. Besides, they tied his hands: he had\r\nalready decided to gallop after Stavrogin at once; and meanwhile he was\r\ndetained by Shatov; he had to cement the quintet together once for all,\r\nin case of emergency.","\"Pity to waste them, they might be of use.\" That,\r\nI imagine, was his way of reasoning.\r\n\r\nAs for Shatov, Pyotr Stepanovitch was firmly convinced that he would\r\nbetray them. All that he had told the others about it was a lie: he had\r\nnever seen the document nor heard of it, but he thought it as certain as\r\nthat twice two makes four. It seemed to him that what had happened--the\r\ndeath of Liza, the death of Marya Timofyevna--would be too much for\r\nShatov, and that he would make up his mind at once.","Who knows? perhaps\r\nhe had grounds for supposing it. It is known, too, that he hated Shatov\r\npersonally; there had at some time been a quarrel between them, and\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch never forgave an offence. I am convinced, indeed,\r\nthat this was his leading motive.\r\n\r\nWe have narrow brick pavements in our town, and in some streets only\r\nraised wooden planks instead of a pavement. Pyotr Stepanovitch walked\r\nin the middle of the pavement, taking up the whole of it, utterly\r\nregardless of Liputin, who had no room to walk beside him and so had to\r\nhurry a step behind or run in the muddy road if he wanted to speak to\r\nhim.","Pyotr Stepanovitch suddenly remembered how he had lately splashed\r\nthrough the mud to keep pace with Stavrogin, who had walked, as he was\r\ndoing now, taking up the whole pavement. He recalled the whole scene,\r\nand rage choked him.\r\n\r\nBut Liputin, too, was choking with resentment. Pyotr Stepanovitch might\r\ntreat the others as he liked, but him! Why, he knew more than all the\r\nrest, was in closer touch with the work and taking more intimate part\r\nin it than anyone, and hitherto his services had been continual, though\r\nindirect.","Oh, he knew that even now Pyotr Stepanovitch might ruin him _if\r\nit came to the worst._ But he had long hated Pyotr Stepanovitch, and not\r\nbecause he was a danger but because of his overbearing manner. Now, when\r\nhe had to make up his mind to such a deed, he raged inwardly more than\r\nall the rest put together. Alas! he knew that next day \"like a slave\"\r\nhe would be the first on the spot and would bring the others, and if\r\nhe could somehow have murdered Pyotr Stepanovitch before the morrow,\r\nwithout ruining himself, of course, he would certainly have murdered\r\nhim.","Absorbed in his sensations, he trudged dejectedly after his tormentor,\r\nwho seemed to have forgotten his existence, though he gave him a\r\nrude and careless shove with his elbow now and then. Suddenly Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch halted in one of the principal thoroughfares and went into\r\na restaurant.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing?\" cried Liputin, boiling over. \"This is a\r\nrestaurant.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want a beefsteak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word! It is always full of people.","\"\r\n\r\n\"What if it is?\"\r\n\r\n\"But... we shall be late. It's ten o'clock already.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't be too late to go there.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I shall be late! They are expecting me back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let them; but it would be stupid of you to go to them. With all\r\nyour bobbery I've had no dinner. And the later you go to Kirillov's the\r\nmore sure you are to find him.\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch went to a room apart. Liputin sat in an easy chair on\r\none side, angry and resentful, and watched him eating.","Half an hour\r\nand more passed. Pyotr Stepanovitch did not hurry himself; he ate with\r\nrelish, rang the bell, asked for a different kind of mustard, then for\r\nbeer, without saying a word to Liputin. He was pondering deeply. He was\r\ncapable of doing two things at once--eating with relish and pondering\r\ndeeply. Liputin loathed him so intensely at last that he could not tear\r\nhimself away. It was like a nervous obsession.","He counted every morsel\r\nof beefsteak that Pyotr Stepanovitch put into his mouth; he loathed him\r\nfor the way he opened it, for the way he chewed, for the way he smacked\r\nhis lips over the fat morsels, he loathed the steak itself. At last\r\nthings began to swim before his eyes; he began to feel slightly giddy;\r\nhe felt hot and cold run down his spine by turns.\r\n\r\n\"You are doing nothing; read that,\" said Pyotr Stepanovitch suddenly,\r\nthrowing him a sheet of paper.","Liputin went nearer to the candle. The\r\npaper was closely covered with bad handwriting, with corrections in\r\nevery line. By the time he had mastered it Pyotr Stepanovitch had paid\r\nhis bill and was ready to go. When they were on the pavement Liputin\r\nhanded him back the paper.\r\n\r\n\"Keep it; I'll tell you afterwards.... What do you say to it, though?\"\r\n\r\nLiputin shuddered all over.\r\n\r\n\"In my opinion.",".. such a manifesto... is nothing but a ridiculous\r\nabsurdity.\"\r\n\r\nHis anger broke out; he felt as though he were being caught up and\r\ncarried along.\r\n\r\n\"If we decide to distribute such manifestoes,\" he said, quivering\r\nall over, \"we'll make ourselves, contemptible by our stupidity and\r\nincompetence.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm! I think differently,\" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, walking on\r\nresolutely.\r\n\r\n\"So do I; surely it isn't your work?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not your business.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I think too that doggerel, 'A Noble Personality,' is the most utter\r\ntrash possible, and it couldn't have been written by Herzen.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are talking nonsense; it's a good poem.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am surprised, too, for instance,\" said Liputin, still dashing along\r\nwith desperate leaps, \"that it is suggested that we should act so as\r\nto bring everything to the ground. It's natural in Europe to wish to\r\ndestroy everything because there's a proletariat there, but we are only\r\namateurs here and in my opinion are only showing off.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were a Fourierist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fourier says something quite different, quite different.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it's nonsense.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Fourier isn't nonsense.... Excuse me, I can't believe that there\r\nwill be a rising in May.\"\r\n\r\nLiputin positively unbuttoned his coat, he was so hot.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's enough; but now, that I mayn't forget it,\" said Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch, passing with extraordinary coolness to another subject,\r\n\"you will have to print this manifesto with your own hands.","We're going\r\nto dig up Shatov's printing press, and you will take it to-morrow. As\r\nquickly as possible you must print as many copies as you can, and then\r\ndistribute them all the winter. The means will be provided. You must\r\ndo as many copies as possible, for you'll be asked for them from other\r\nplaces.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, excuse me; I can't undertake such a... I decline.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll take it all the same. I am acting on the instructions of the\r\ncentral committee, and you are bound to obey.","\"\r\n\r\n\"And I consider that our centres abroad have forgotten what Russia is\r\nlike and have lost all touch, and that's why they talk such\r\nnonsense.... I even think that instead of many hundreds of quintets in\r\nRussia, we are the only one that exists, and there is no network at\r\nall,\" Liputin gasped finally.\r\n\r\n\"The more contemptible of you, then, to run after the cause without\r\nbelieving in it... and you are running after me now like a mean little\r\ncur.","\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not. We have a full right to break off and found a new\r\nsociety.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fool!\" Pyotr Stepanovitch boomed at him threateningly all of a sudden,\r\nwith flashing eyes.\r\n\r\nThey stood facing one another for some time. Pyotr Stepanovitch turned\r\nand pursued his way confidently.\r\n\r\nThe idea flashed through Liputin's mind, \"Turn and go back; if I don't\r\nturn now I shall never go back.\" He pondered this for ten steps, but at\r\nthe eleventh a new and desperate idea flashed into his mind: he did not\r\nturn and did not go back.","They were approaching Filipov's house, but before reaching it they\r\nturned down a side street, or, to be more accurate, an inconspicuous\r\npath under a fence, so that for some time they had to walk along a steep\r\nslope above a ditch where they could not keep their footing without\r\nholding the fence. At a dark corner in the slanting fence Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch took out a plank, leaving a gap, through which he promptly\r\nscrambled.","Liputin was surprised, but he crawled through after him; then\r\nthey replaced the plank after them. This was the secret way by which\r\nFedka used to visit Kirillov.\r\n\r\n\"Shatov mustn't know that we are here,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch whispered\r\nsternly to Liputin.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nKirillov was sitting on his leather sofa drinking tea, as he always was\r\nat that hour. He did not get up to meet them, but gave a sort of start\r\nand looked at the new-comers anxiously.","\"You are not mistaken,\" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, \"it's just that I've\r\ncome about.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, to-morrow... about this time.\" And he hurriedly sat down at\r\nthe table, watching Kirillov's agitation with some uneasiness. But the\r\nlatter had already regained his composure and looked as usual.\r\n\r\n\"These people still refuse to believe in you. You are not vexed at my\r\nbringing Liputin?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-day I am not vexed; to-morrow I want to be alone.","\"\r\n\r\n\"But not before I come, and therefore in my presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should prefer not in your presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"You remember you promised to write and to sign all I dictated.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care. And now will you be here long?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have to see one man and to remain half an hour, so whatever you say I\r\nshall stay that half-hour.\"\r\n\r\nKirillov did not speak. Liputin meanwhile sat down on one side under the\r\nportrait of the bishop.","That last desperate idea gained more and more\r\npossession of him. Kirillov scarcely noticed him. Liputin had heard\r\nof Kirillov's theory before and always laughed at him; but now he was\r\nsilent and looked gloomily round him.\r\n\r\n\"I've no objection to some tea,\" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, moving up.\r\n\"I've just had some steak and was reckoning on getting tea with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Drink it. You can have some if you like.","\"\r\n\r\n\"You used to offer it to me,\" observed Pyotr Stepanovitch sourly.\r\n\r\n\"That's no matter. Let Liputin have some too.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I... can't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't want to or can't?\" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, turning quickly to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"I am not going to here,\" Liputin said expressively.\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch frowned.\r\n\r\n\"There's a flavour of mysticism about that; goodness knows what to make\r\nof you people!\"\r\n\r\nNo one answered; there was a full minute of silence.","\"But I know one thing,\" he added abruptly, \"that no superstition will\r\nprevent any one of us from doing his duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has Stavrogin gone?\" asked Kirillov.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's done well.\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch's eyes gleamed, but he restrained himself.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care what you think as long as every one keeps his word.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll keep my word.\"\r\n\r\n\"I always knew that you would do your duty like an independent and\r\nprogressive man.","\"\r\n\r\n\"You are an absurd fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be; I am very glad to amuse you. I am always glad if I can\r\ngive people pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very anxious I should shoot myself and are afraid I might\r\nsuddenly not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see, it was your own doing--connecting your plan with our\r\nwork. Reckoning on your plan we have already done something, so that you\r\ncouldn't refuse now because you've let us in for it.","\"\r\n\r\n\"You've no claim at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand, I understand; you are perfectly free, and we don't come\r\nin so long as your free intention is carried out.\"\r\n\r\n\"And am I to take on myself all the nasty things you've done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Kirillov, are you afraid? If you want to cry off, say so at\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ask because you are making so many inquiries.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Asking questions again?\"\r\n\r\nKirillov scanned him contemptuously.","\"You see,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch went on, getting angrier and angrier, and\r\nunable to take the right tone, \"you want me to go away, to be alone, to\r\nconcentrate yourself, but all that's a bad sign for you--for you above\r\nall. You want to think a great deal. To my mind you'd better not think.\r\nAnd really you make me uneasy.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's only one thing I hate, that at such a moment I should have a\r\nreptile like you beside me.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that doesn't matter. I'll go away at the time and stand on the\r\nsteps if you like. If you are so concerned about trifles when it comes\r\nto dying, then... it's all a very bad sign. I'll go out on to the\r\nsteps and you can imagine I know nothing about it, and that I am a man\r\ninfinitely below you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not infinitely; you've got abilities, but there's a lot you don't\r\nunderstand because you are a low man.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Delighted, delighted. I told you already I am delighted to provide\r\nentertainment... at such a moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't understand anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is, I... well, I listen with respect, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can do nothing; even now you can't hide your petty spite, though\r\nit's not to your interest to show it. You'll make me cross, and then I\r\nmay want another six months.\" Pyotr Stepanovitch looked at his watch.","\"I never understood your theory, but I know you didn't invent it for our\r\nsakes, so I suppose you would carry it out apart from us. And I know too\r\nthat you haven't mastered the idea but the idea has mastered you, so you\r\nwon't put it off.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? The idea has mastered me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And not I mastered the idea? That's good. You have a little sense. Only\r\nyou tease me and I am proud.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a good thing, that's a good thing.","Just what you need, to be\r\nproud.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough. You've drunk your tea; go away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn it all, I suppose I must\"--Pyotr Stepanovitch got up--\"though\r\nit's early. Listen, Kirillov. Shall I find that man--you know whom I\r\nmean--at Myasnitchiha's? Or has she too been lying?\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't find him, because he is here and not there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here! Damn it all, where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sitting in the kitchen, eating and drinking.","\"\r\n\r\n\"How dared he?\" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch, flushing angrily. \"It was his\r\nduty to wait... what nonsense! He has no passport, no money!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. He came to say good-bye; he is dressed and ready. He\r\nis going away and won't come back. He says you are a scoundrel and he\r\ndoesn't want to wait for your money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha ha! He is afraid that I'll... But even now I can... if... Where is\r\nhe, in the kitchen?\"\r\n\r\nKirillov opened a side door into a tiny dark room; from this room three\r\nsteps led straight to the part of the kitchen where the cook's bed was\r\nusually put, behind the partition.","Here, in the corner under the ikons,\r\nFedka was sitting now, at a bare deal table. Before him stood a\r\npint bottle, a plate of bread, and some cold beef and potatoes on an\r\nearthenware dish. He was eating in a leisurely way and was already half\r\ndrunk, but he was wearing his sheep-skin coat and was evidently ready\r\nfor a journey. A samovar was boiling the other side of the screen, but\r\nit was not for Fedka, who had every night for a week or more zealously\r\nblown it up and got it ready for \"Alexey Nilitch, for he's such a habit\r\nof drinking tea at nights.","\" I am strongly disposed to believe that,\r\nas Kirillov had not a cook, he had cooked the beef and potatoes that\r\nmorning with his own hands for Fedka.\r\n\r\n\"What notion is this?\" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch, whisking into the room.\r\n\"Why didn't you wait where you were ordered?\"\r\n\r\nAnd swinging his fist, he brought it down heavily on the table.\r\n\r\nFedka assumed an air of dignity.\r\n\r\n\"You wait a bit, Pyotr Stepanovitch, you wait a bit,\" he began, with a\r\nswaggering emphasis on each word, \"it's your first duty to understand\r\nhere that you are on a polite visit to Mr.","Kirillov, Alexey Nilitch,\r\nwhose boots you might clean any day, because beside you he is a man of\r\nculture and you are only--foo!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he made a jaunty show of spitting to one side. Haughtiness and\r\ndetermination were evident in his manner, and a certain very threatening\r\nassumption of argumentative calm that suggested an outburst to follow.\r\nBut Pyotr Stepanovitch had no time to realise the danger, and it did not\r\nfit in with his preconceived ideas.","The incidents and disasters of the\r\nday had quite turned his head. Liputin, at the top of the three steps,\r\nstared inquisitively down from the little dark room.\r\n\r\n\"Do you or don't you want a trustworthy passport and good money to go\r\nwhere you've been told? Yes or no?\"\r\n\r\n\"D'you see, Pyotr Stepanovitch, you've been deceiving me from the first,\r\nand so you've been a regular scoundrel to me. For all the world like a\r\nfilthy human louse--that's how I look on you.","You've promised me a lot\r\nof money for shedding innocent blood and swore it was for Mr. Stavrogin,\r\nthough it turns out to be nothing but your want of breeding. I didn't\r\nget a farthing out of it, let alone fifteen hundred, and Mr. Stavrogin\r\nhit you in the face, which has come to our ears. Now you are threatening\r\nme again and promising me money--what for, you don't say. And I\r\nshouldn't wonder if you are sending me to Petersburg to plot some\r\nrevenge in your spite against Mr.","Stavrogin, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch,\r\nreckoning on my simplicity. And that proves you are the chief murderer.\r\nAnd do you know what you deserve for the very fact that in the depravity\r\nof your heart you've given up believing in God Himself, the true\r\nCreator? You are no better than an idolater and are on a level with\r\nthe Tatar and the Mordva. Alexey Nilitch, who is a philosopher, has\r\nexpounded the true God, the Creator, many a time to you, as well as the\r\ncreation of the world and the fate that's to come and the transformation\r\nof every sort of creature and every sort of beast out of the Apocalypse,\r\nbut you've persisted like a senseless idol in your deafness and your\r\ndumbness and have brought Ensign Erkel to the same, like the veriest\r\nevil seducer and so-called atheist.","...\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you drunken dog! He strips the ikons of their setting and then\r\npreaches about God!\"\r\n\r\n\"D'you see, Pyotr Stepanovitch, I tell you truly that I have stripped\r\nthe ikons, but I only took out the pearls; and how do you know? Perhaps\r\nmy own tear was transformed into a pearl in the furnace of the Most High\r\nto make up for my sufferings, seeing I am just that very orphan, having\r\nno daily refuge.","Do you know from the books that once, in ancient times,\r\na merchant with just such tearful sighs and prayers stole a pearl from\r\nthe halo of the Mother of God, and afterwards, in the face of all the\r\npeople, laid the whole price of it at her feet, and the Holy Mother\r\nsheltered him with her mantle before all the people, so that it was a\r\nmiracle, and the command was given through the authorities to write it\r\nall down word for word in the Imperial books.","And you let a mouse in,\r\nso you insulted the very throne of God. And if you were not my natural\r\nmaster, whom I dandled in my arms when I was a stripling, I would have\r\ndone for you now, without budging from this place!\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch flew into a violent rage.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, have you seen Stavrogin to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you dare to question me. Mr. Stavrogin is fairly amazed at you,\r\nand he had no share in it even in wish, let alone instructions or giving\r\nmoney.","You've presumed with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll get the money and you'll get another two thousand in Petersburg,\r\nwhen you get there, in a lump sum, and you'll get more.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are lying, my fine gentleman, and it makes me laugh to see how\r\neasily you are taken in. Mr. Stavrogin stands at the top of the ladder\r\nabove you, and you yelp at him from below like a silly puppy dog, while\r\nhe thinks it would be doing you an honour to spit at you.","\"\r\n\r\n\"But do you know,\" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch in a rage, \"that I won't\r\nlet you stir a step from here, you scoundrel, and I'll hand you straight\r\nover to the police.\"\r\n\r\nFedka leapt on to his feet and his eyes gleamed with fury. Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch pulled out his revolver. Then followed a rapid and\r\nrevolting scene: before Pyotr Stepanovitch could take aim, Fedka swung\r\nround and in a flash struck him on the cheek with all his might.","Then\r\nthere was the thud of a second blow, a third, then a fourth, all on the\r\ncheek. Pyotr Stepanovitch was dazed; with his eyes starting out of his\r\nhead, he muttered something, and suddenly crashed full length to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\"There you are; take him,\" shouted Fedka with a triumphant swagger; he\r\ninstantly took up his cap, his bag from under the bench, and was gone.\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch lay gasping and unconscious.","Liputin even imagined\r\nthat he had been murdered. Kirillov ran headlong into the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\"Water!\" he cried, and ladling some water in an iron dipper from a\r\nbucket, he poured it over the injured man's head. Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\nstirred, raised his head, sat up, and looked blankly about him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, how are you?\" asked Kirillov. Pyotr Stepanovitch looked at him\r\nintently, still not recognising him; but seeing Liputin peeping in from\r\nthe kitchen, he smiled his hateful smile and suddenly got up, picking up\r\nhis revolver from the floor.","\"If you take it into your head to run away to-morrow like that scoundrel\r\nStavrogin,\" he cried, pouncing furiously on Kirillov, pale, stammering,\r\nand hardly able to articulate his words, \"I'll hang you... like a\r\nfly... or crush you... if it's at the other end of the world... do you\r\nunderstand!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he held the revolver straight at Kirillov's head; but almost at the\r\nsame minute, coming completely to himself, he drew back his hand, thrust\r\nthe revolver into his pocket, and without saying another word ran out of\r\nthe house.","Liputin followed him. They clambered through the same gap and\r\nagain walked along the slope holding to the fence. Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\nstrode rapidly down the street so that Liputin could scarcely keep up\r\nwith him. At the first crossing he suddenly stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" He turned to Liputin with a challenge.\r\n\r\nLiputin remembered the revolver and was still trembling all over after\r\nthe scene he had witnessed; but the answer seemed to come of itself\r\nirresistibly from his tongue:\r\n\r\n\"I think.",".. I think that...\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see what Fedka was drinking in the kitchen?\"\r\n\r\n\"What he was drinking? He was drinking vodka.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then, let me tell you it's the last time in his life he will drink\r\nvodka. I recommend you to remember that and reflect on it. And now go to\r\nhell; you are not wanted till to-morrow. But mind now, don't be a fool!\"\r\n\r\nLiputin rushed home full speed.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nHe had long had a passport in readiness made out in a false name.","It\r\nseems a wild idea that this prudent little man, the petty despot of\r\nhis family, who was, above all things, a sharp man of business and a\r\ncapitalist, and who was an official too (though he was a Fourierist),\r\nshould long before have conceived the fantastic project of procuring\r\nthis passport in case of emergency, that he might escape abroad by means\r\nof it _if_... he did admit the possibility of this if, though no doubt he\r\nwas never able himself to formulate what this _if_ might mean.","But now it suddenly formulated itself, and in a most unexpected way.\r\nThat desperate idea with which he had gone to Kirillov's after that\r\n\"fool\" he had heard from Pyotr Stepanovitch on the pavement, had been\r\nto abandon everything at dawn next day and to emigrate abroad. If anyone\r\ndoubts that such fantastic incidents occur in everyday Russian life,\r\neven now, let him look into the biographies of all the Russian exiles\r\nabroad.","Not one of them escaped with more wisdom or real justification.\r\nIt has always been the unrestrained domination of phantoms and nothing\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nRunning home, he began by locking himself in, getting out his travelling\r\nbag, and feverishly beginning to pack. His chief anxiety was the\r\nquestion of money, and how much he could rescue from the impending\r\nruin--and by what means. He thought of it as \"rescuing,\" for it seemed\r\nto him that he could not linger an hour, and that by daylight he must\r\nbe on the high road.","He did not know where to take the train either; he\r\nvaguely determined to take it at the second or third big station from\r\nthe town, and to make his way there on foot, if necessary. In that way,\r\ninstinctively and mechanically he busied himself in his packing with a\r\nperfect whirl of ideas in his head--and suddenly stopped short, gave it\r\nall up, and with a deep groan stretched himself on the sofa.","He felt clearly, and suddenly realised that he might escape, but that\r\nhe was by now utterly incapable of deciding whether he ought to make off\r\n_before or after_ Shatov's death; that he was simply a lifeless body, a\r\ncrude inert mass; that he was being moved by an awful outside power; and\r\nthat, though he had a passport to go abroad, that though he could run\r\naway from Shatov (otherwise what need was there of such haste?), yet he\r\nwould run away, not from Shatov, not before his murder, but _after_ it,\r\nand that that was determined, signed, and sealed.","In insufferable distress, trembling every instant and wondering at\r\nhimself, alternately groaning aloud and numb with terror, he managed to\r\nexist till eleven o'clock next morning locked in and lying on the sofa;\r\nthen came the shock he was awaiting, and it at once determined him. When\r\nhe unlocked his door and went out to his household at eleven o'clock\r\nthey told him that the runaway convict and brigand, Fedka, who was a\r\nterror to every one, who had pillaged churches and only lately been\r\nguilty of murder and arson, who was being pursued and could not be\r\ncaptured by our police, had been found at daybreak murdered, five miles\r\nfrom the town, at a turning off the high road, and that the whole town\r\nwas talking of it already.","He rushed headlong out of the house at once\r\nto find out further details, and learned, to begin with, that Fedka, who\r\nhad been found with his skull broken, had apparently been robbed and,\r\nsecondly, that the police already had strong suspicion and even good\r\ngrounds for believing that the murderer was one of the Shpigulin men\r\ncalled Fomka, the very one who had been his accomplice in murdering the\r\nLebyadkins and setting fire to their house, and that there had been a\r\nquarrel between them on the road about a large sum of money stolen from\r\nLebyadkin, which Fedka was supposed to have hidden.","Liputin ran to Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch's lodgings and succeeded in learning at the back door, on\r\nthe sly, that though Pyotr Stepanovitch had not returned home till about\r\none o'clock at night, he had slept there quietly all night till eight\r\no'clock next morning. Of course, there could be no doubt that there was\r\nnothing extraordinary about Fedka's death, and that such careers usually\r\nhave such an ending; but the coincidence of the fatal words that \"it was\r\nthe last time Fedka would drink vodka,\" with the prompt fulfilment of\r\nthe prediction, was so remarkable that Liputin no longer hesitated.","The\r\nshock had been given; it was as though a stone had fallen upon him and\r\ncrushed him forever. Returning home, he thrust his travelling-bag under\r\nthe bed without a word, and in the evening at the hour fixed he was the\r\nfirst to appear at the appointed spot to meet Shatov, though it's true\r\nhe still had his passport in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. A WANDERER\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE CATASTROPHE WITH Liza and the death of Marya Timofyevna made an\r\noverwhelming impression on Shatov.","I have already mentioned that that\r\nmorning I met him in passing; he seemed to me not himself. He told me\r\namong other things that on the evening before at nine o'clock (that\r\nis, three hours before the fire had broken out) he had been at Marya\r\nTimofyevna's. He went in the morning to look at the corpses, but as far\r\nas I know gave no evidence of any sort that morning. Meanwhile, towards\r\nthe end of the day there was a perfect tempest in his soul, and.",".. I\r\nthink I can say with certainty that there was a moment at dusk when he\r\nwanted to get up, go out and tell everything. What that _everything_ was,\r\nno one but he could say. Of course he would have achieved nothing, and\r\nwould have simply betrayed himself. He had no proofs whatever with which\r\nto convict the perpetrators of the crime, and, indeed, he had nothing\r\nbut vague conjectures to go upon, though to him they amounted to\r\ncomplete certainty.","But he was ready to ruin himself if he could only\r\n\"crush the scoundrels\"--his own words. Pyotr Stepanovitch had guessed\r\nfairly correctly at this impulse in him, and he knew himself that he\r\nwas risking a great deal in putting off the execution of his new\r\nawful project till next day. On his side there was, as usual, great\r\nself-confidence and contempt for all these \"wretched creatures\" and for\r\nShatov in particular.","He had for years despised Shatov for his \"whining\r\nidiocy,\" as he had expressed it in former days abroad, and he was\r\nabsolutely confident that he could deal with such a guileless creature,\r\nthat is, keep an eye on him all that day, and put a check on him at the\r\nfirst sign of danger. Yet what saved \"the scoundrels\" for a short time\r\nwas something quite unexpected which they had not foreseen....\r\n\r\nTowards eight o'clock in the evening (at the very time when the quintet\r\nwas meeting at Erkel's, and waiting in indignation and excitement for\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch) Shatov was lying in the dark on his bed with a\r\nheadache and a slight chill; he was tortured by uncertainty, he was\r\nangry, he kept making up his mind, and could not make it up finally, and\r\nfelt, with a curse, that it would all lead to nothing.","Gradually he sank\r\ninto a brief doze and had something like a nightmare. He dreamt that\r\nhe was lying on his bed, tied up with cords and unable to stir, and\r\nmeantime he heard a terrible banging that echoed all over the house, a\r\nbanging on the fence, at the gate, at his door, in Kirillov's lodge,\r\nso that the whole house was shaking, and a far-away familiar voice that\r\nwrung his heart was calling to him piteously.","He suddenly woke and sat\r\nup in bed. To his surprise the banging at the gate went on, though\r\nnot nearly so violent as it had seemed in his dream. The knocks were\r\nrepeated and persistent, and the strange voice \"that wrung his heart\"\r\ncould still be heard below at the gate, though not piteously but angrily\r\nand impatiently, alternating with another voice, more restrained and\r\nordinary. He jumped up, opened the casement pane and put his head out.","\"Who's there?\" he called, literally numb with terror.\r\n\r\n\"If you are Shatov,\" the answer came harshly and resolutely from below,\r\n\"be so good as to tell me straight out and honestly whether you agree to\r\nlet me in or not?\"\r\n\r\nIt was true: he recognised the voice!\r\n\r\n\"Marie!... Is it you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, Marya Shatov, and I assure you I can't keep the driver a\r\nminute longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"This minute... I'll get a candle,\" Shatov cried faintly.","Then he rushed\r\nto look for the matches. The matches, as always happens at such moments,\r\ncould not be found. He dropped the candlestick and the candle on the\r\nfloor and as soon as he heard the impatient voice from below again, he\r\nabandoned the search and dashed down the steep stairs to open the gate.\r\n\r\n\"Be so good as to hold the bag while I settle with this blockhead,\" was\r\nhow Madame Marya Shatov greeted him below, and she thrust into his hands\r\na rather light cheap canvas handbag studded with brass nails, of Dresden\r\nmanufacture.","She attacked the driver with exasperation.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to tell you, you are asking too much. If you've been driving\r\nme for an extra hour through these filthy streets, that's your fault,\r\nbecause it seems you didn't know where to find this stupid street and\r\nimbecile house. Take your thirty kopecks and make up your mind that\r\nyou'll get nothing more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ech, lady, you told me yourself Voznesensky Street and this is\r\nBogoyavlensky; Voznesensky is ever so far away.","You've simply put the\r\nhorse into a steam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Voznesensky, Bogoyavlensky--you ought to know all those stupid names\r\nbetter than I do, as you are an inhabitant; besides, you are unfair, I\r\ntold you first of all Filipov's house and you declared you knew it. In\r\nany case you can have me up to-morrow in the local court, but now I beg\r\nyou to let me alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, here's another five kopecks.\" With eager haste Shatov pulled a\r\nfive-kopeck piece out of his pocket and gave it to the driver.","\"Do me a favour, I beg you, don't dare to do that!\" Madame Shatov flared\r\nup, but the driver drove off and Shatov, taking her hand, drew her\r\nthrough the gate.\r\n\r\n\"Make haste, Marie, make haste... that's no matter, and... you are wet\r\nthrough. Take care, we go up here--how sorry I am there's no light--the\r\nstairs are steep, hold tight, hold tight! Well, this is my room. Excuse\r\nmy having no light.",".. One minute!\"\r\n\r\nHe picked up the candlestick but it was a long time before the matches\r\nwere found. Madame Shatov stood waiting in the middle of the room,\r\nsilent and motionless.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God, here they are at last!\" he cried joyfully, lighting up the\r\nroom. Marya Shatov took a cursory survey of his abode.\r\n\r\n\"They told me you lived in a poor way, but I didn't expect it to be\r\nas bad as this,\" she pronounced with an air of disgust, and she moved\r\ntowards the bed.","\"Oh, I am tired!\" she sat down on the hard bed, with an exhausted air.\r\n\"Please put down the bag and sit down on the chair yourself. Just as you\r\nlike though; you are in the way standing there. I have come to you for\r\na time, till I can get work, because I know nothing of this place and I\r\nhave no money. But if I shall be in your way I beg you again, be so good\r\nas to tell me so at once, as you are bound to do if you are an honest\r\nman.","I could sell something to-morrow and pay for a room at an hotel,\r\nbut you must take me to the hotel yourself.... Oh, but I am tired!\"\r\n\r\nShatov was all of a tremor.\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't, Marie, you mustn't go to an hotel! An hotel! What for?\r\nWhat for?\"\r\n\r\nHe clasped his hands imploringly....\r\n\r\n\"Well, if I can get on without the hotel... I must, any way, explain the\r\nposition. Remember, Shatov, that we lived in Geneva as man and wife for\r\na fortnight and a few days; it's three years since we parted, without\r\nany particular quarrel though.","But don't imagine that I've come back\r\nto renew any of the foolishness of the past. I've come back to look for\r\nwork, and that I've come straight to this town is just because it's all\r\nthe same to me. I've not come to say I am sorry for anything; please\r\ndon't imagine anything so stupid as that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Marie! This is unnecessary, quite unnecessary,\" Shatov muttered\r\nvaguely.\r\n\r\n\"If so, if you are so far developed as to be able to understand that, I\r\nmay allow myself to add, that if I've come straight to you now and am\r\nin your lodging, it's partly because I always thought you were far\r\nfrom being a scoundrel and were perhaps much better than other.","..\r\nblackguards!\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes flashed. She must have had to bear a great deal at the hands of\r\nsome \"blackguards.\"\r\n\r\n\"And please believe me, I wasn't laughing at you just now when I told\r\nyou you were good. I spoke plainly, without fine phrases and I can't\r\nendure them. But that's all nonsense. I always hoped you would have\r\nsense enough not to pester me.... Enough, I am tired.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she bent on him a long, harassed and weary gaze.","Shatov stood\r\nfacing her at the other end of the room, which was five paces away, and\r\nlistened to her timidly with a look of new life and unwonted radiance\r\non his face. This strong, rugged man, all bristles on the surface,\r\nwas suddenly all softness and shining gladness. There was a thrill\r\nof extraordinary and unexpected feeling in his soul. Three years of\r\nseparation, three years of the broken marriage had effaced nothing from\r\nhis heart.","And perhaps every day during those three years he had dreamed\r\nof her, of that beloved being who had once said to him, \"I love you.\"\r\nKnowing Shatov I can say with certainty that he could never have allowed\r\nhimself even to dream that a woman might say to him, \"I love you.\"\r\nHe was savagely modest and chaste, he looked on himself as a perfect\r\nmonster, detested his own face as well as his character, compared\r\nhimself to some freak only fit to be exhibited at fairs.","Consequently\r\nhe valued honesty above everything and was fanatically devoted to his\r\nconvictions; he was gloomy, proud, easily moved to wrath, and sparing\r\nof words. But here was the one being who had loved him for a fortnight\r\n(that he had never doubted, never!), a being he had always considered\r\nimmeasurably above him in spite of his perfectly sober understanding of\r\nher errors; a being to whom he could forgive everything, _everything_ (of\r\nthat there could be no question; indeed it was quite the other way, his\r\nidea was that he was entirely to blame); this woman, this Marya Shatov,\r\nwas in his house, in his presence again.",".. it was almost inconceivable!\r\nHe was so overcome, there was so much that was terrible and at the same\r\ntime so much happiness in this event that he could not, perhaps would\r\nnot--perhaps was afraid to--realise the position. It was a dream. But\r\nwhen she looked at him with that harassed gaze he suddenly understood\r\nthat this woman he loved so dearly was suffering, perhaps had been\r\nwronged. His heart went cold.","He looked at her features with anguish:\r\nthe first bloom of youth had long faded from this exhausted face. It's\r\ntrue that she was still good-looking--in his eyes a beauty, as she had\r\nalways been. In reality she was a woman of twenty-five, rather strongly\r\nbuilt, above the medium height (taller than Shatov), with abundant dark\r\nbrown hair, a pale oval face, and large dark eyes now glittering with\r\nfeverish brilliance.","But the light-hearted, na√Øve and good-natured\r\nenergy he had known so well in the past was replaced now by a sullen\r\nirritability and disillusionment, a sort of cynicism which was not yet\r\nhabitual to her herself, and which weighed upon her. But the chief thing\r\nwas that she was ill, that he could see clearly. In spite of the awe in\r\nwhich he stood of her he suddenly went up to her and took her by both\r\nhands.","\"Marie... you know... you are very tired, perhaps, for God's sake, don't\r\nbe angry.... If you'd consent to have some tea, for instance, eh? Tea\r\npicks one up so, doesn't it? If you'd consent!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why talk about consenting! Of course I consent, what a baby you are\r\nstill. Get me some if you can. How cramped you are here. How cold it\r\nis!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'll get some logs for the fire directly, some logs.",".. I've got\r\nlogs.\" Shatov was all astir. \"Logs... that is... but I'll get tea\r\ndirectly,\" he waved his hand as though with desperate determination and\r\nsnatched up his cap.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going? So you've no tea in the house?\"\r\n\r\n\"There shall be, there shall be, there shall be, there shall be\r\neverything directly.... I...\" he took his revolver from the shelf, \"I'll\r\nsell this revolver directly.",".. or pawn it....\"\r\n\r\n\"What foolishness and what a time that will take! Take my money if\r\nyou've nothing, there's eighty kopecks here, I think; that's all I have.\r\nThis is like a madhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want your money, I don't want it I'll be here directly, in one\r\ninstant. I can manage without the revolver....\"\r\n\r\nAnd he rushed straight to Kirillov's. This was probably two hours before\r\nthe visit of Pyotr Stepanovitch and Liputin to Kirillov.","Though Shatov\r\nand Kirillov lived in the same yard they hardly ever saw each other, and\r\nwhen they met they did not nod or speak: they had been too long \"lying\r\nside by side\" in America....\r\n\r\n\"Kirillov, you always have tea; have you got tea and a samovar?\"\r\n\r\nKirillov, who was walking up and down the room, as he was in the habit\r\nof doing all night, stopped and looked intently at his hurried visitor,\r\nthough without much surprise.","\"I've got tea and sugar and a samovar. But there's no need of the\r\nsamovar, the tea is hot. Sit down and simply drink it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kirillov, we lay side by side in America.... My wife has come to me ...\r\nI... give me the tea.... I shall want the samovar.\"\r\n\r\n\"If your wife is here you want the samovar. But take it later. I've\r\ntwo. And now take the teapot from the table. It's hot, boiling hot. Take\r\neverything, take the sugar, all of it.","Bread... there's plenty of bread;\r\nall of it. There's some veal. I've a rouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give it me, friend, I'll pay it back to-morrow! Ach, Kirillov!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it the same wife who was in Switzerland? That's a good thing. And\r\nyour running in like this, that's a good thing too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kirillov!\" cried Shatov, taking the teapot under his arm and carrying\r\nthe bread and sugar in both hands. \"Kirillov, if.",".. if you could get rid\r\nof your dreadful fancies and give up your atheistic ravings... oh, what\r\na man you'd be, Kirillov!\"\r\n\r\n\"One can see you love your wife after Switzerland. It's a good thing you\r\ndo--after Switzerland. When you want tea, come again. You can come all\r\nnight, I don't sleep at all. There'll be a samovar. Take the rouble,\r\nhere it is. Go to your wife, I'll stay here and think about you and your\r\nwife.","\"\r\n\r\nMarya Shatov was unmistakably pleased at her husband's haste and fell\r\nupon the tea almost greedily, but there was no need to run for the\r\nsamovar; she drank only half a cup and swallowed a tiny piece of bread.\r\nThe veal she refused with disgust and irritation.\r\n\r\n\"You are ill, Marie, all this is a sign of illness,\" Shatov remarked\r\ntimidly as he waited upon her.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I'm ill, please sit down.","Where did you get the tea if you\r\nhaven't any?\"\r\n\r\nShatov told her about Kirillov briefly. She had heard something of him.\r\n\r\n\"I know he is mad; say no more, please; there are plenty of fools. So\r\nyou've been in America? I heard, you wrote.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I... I wrote to you in Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, please talk of something else. Are you a Slavophil in your\r\nconvictions?\"\r\n\r\n\"I... I am not exactly.... Since I cannot be a Russian, I became a\r\nSlavophil.","\" He smiled a wry smile with the effort of one who feels he\r\nhas made a strained and inappropriate jest.\r\n\r\n\"Why, aren't you a Russian?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's all foolishness. Do sit down, I entreat you. Why are you\r\nall over the place? Do you think I am lightheaded? Perhaps I shall be.\r\nYou say there are only you two in the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.... Downstairs...\"\r\n\r\n\"And both such clever people.","What is there downstairs? You said\r\ndownstairs?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why nothing? I want to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only meant to say that now we are only two in the yard, but that the\r\nLebyadkins used to live downstairs....\"\r\n\r\n\"That woman who was murdered last night?\" she started suddenly. \"I heard\r\nof it. I heard of it as soon as I arrived. There was a fire here, wasn't\r\nthere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Marie, yes, and perhaps I am doing a scoundrelly thing this moment\r\nin forgiving the scoundrels.","...\" He stood up suddenly and paced about\r\nthe room, raising his arms as though in a frenzy.\r\n\r\nBut Marie had not quite understood him. She heard his answers\r\ninattentively; she asked questions but did not listen.\r\n\r\n\"Fine things are being done among you! Oh, how contemptible it all is!\r\nWhat scoundrels men all are! But do sit down, I beg you, oh, how you\r\nexasperate me!\" and she let her head sink on the pillow, exhausted.","\"Marie, I won't.... Perhaps you'll lie down, Marie?\" She made no answer\r\nand closed her eyes helplessly. Her pale face looked death-like. She\r\nfell asleep almost instantly. Shatov looked round, snuffed the candle,\r\nlooked uneasily at her face once more, pressed his hands tight in front\r\nof him and walked on tiptoe out of the room into the passage. At the\r\ntop of the stairs he stood in the corner with his face to the wall and\r\nremained so for ten minutes without sound or movement.","He would have\r\nstood there longer, but he suddenly caught the sound of soft cautious\r\nsteps below. Someone was coming up the stairs. Shatov remembered he had\r\nforgotten to fasten the gate.\r\n\r\n\"Who's there?\" he asked in a whisper. The unknown visitor went on slowly\r\nmounting the stairs without answering. When he reached the top he stood\r\nstill; it was impossible to see his face in the dark; suddenly Shatov\r\nheard the cautious question:\r\n\r\n\"Ivan Shatov?\"\r\n\r\nShatov said who he was, but at once held out his hand to check his\r\nadvance.","The latter took his hand, and Shatov shuddered as though he had\r\ntouched some terrible reptile.\r\n\r\n\"Stand here,\" he whispered quickly. \"Don't go in, I can't receive you\r\njust now. My wife has come back. I'll fetch the candle.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he returned with the candle he found a young officer standing\r\nthere; he did not know his name but he had seen him before.\r\n\r\n\"Erkel,\" said the lad, introducing himself.","\"You've seen me at\r\nVirginsky's.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember; you sat writing. Listen,\" said Shatov in sudden excitement,\r\ngoing up to him frantically, but still talking in a whisper. \"You gave\r\nme a sign just now when you took my hand. But you know I can treat all\r\nthese signals with contempt! I don't acknowledge them.... I don't want\r\nthem.... I can throw you downstairs this minute, do you know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I know nothing about that and I don't know what you are in such a\r\nrage about,\" the visitor answered without malice and almost ingenuously.","\"I have only to give you a message, and that's what I've come for, being\r\nparticularly anxious not to lose time. You have a printing press which\r\ndoes not belong to you, and of which you are bound to give an account,\r\nas you know yourself. I have received instructions to request you to\r\ngive it up to-morrow at seven o'clock in the evening to Liputin. I have\r\nbeen instructed to tell you also that nothing more will be asked of\r\nyou.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely nothing. Your request is granted, and you are struck off our\r\nlist. I was instructed to tell you that positively.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who instructed you to tell me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those who told me the sign.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you come from abroad?\"\r\n\r\n\"I... I think that's no matter to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hang it! Why didn't you come before if you were told to?\"\r\n\r\n\"I followed certain instructions and was not alone.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand, I understand that you were not alone. Eh... hang it! But\r\nwhy didn't Liputin come himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"So I shall come for you to-morrow at exactly six o'clock in the\r\nevening, and we'll go there on foot. There will be no one there but us\r\nthree.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will Verhovensky be there?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he won't. Verhovensky is leaving the town at eleven o'clock\r\nto-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just what I thought!\" Shatov whispered furiously, and he struck his\r\nfist on his hip.","\"He's run off, the sneak!\"\r\n\r\nHe sank into agitated reflection. Erkel looked intently at him and\r\nwaited in silence.\r\n\r\n\"But how will you take it? You can't simply pick it up in your hands and\r\ncarry it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There will be no need to. You'll simply point out the place and we'll\r\njust make sure that it really is buried there. We only know whereabouts\r\nthe place is, we don't know the place itself. And have you pointed the\r\nplace out to anyone else yet?\"\r\n\r\nShatov looked at him.","\"You, you, a chit of a boy like you, a silly boy like you, you too have\r\ngot caught in that net like a sheep? Yes, that's just the young blood\r\nthey want! Well, go along. E-ech! that scoundrel's taken you all in and\r\nrun away.\"\r\n\r\nErkel looked at him serenely and calmly but did not seem to understand.\r\n\r\n\"Verhovensky, Verhovensky has run away!\" Shatov growled fiercely.\r\n\r\n\"But he is still here, he is not gone away.","He is not going till\r\nto-morrow,\" Erkel observed softly and persuasively. \"I particularly\r\nbegged him to be present as a witness; my instructions all referred to\r\nhim (he explained frankly like a young and inexperienced boy). But I\r\nregret to say he did not agree on the ground of his departure, and he\r\nreally is in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\nShatov glanced compassionately at the simple youth again, but suddenly\r\ngave a gesture of despair as though he thought \"they are not worth\r\npitying.","\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, I'll come,\" he cut him short. \"And now get away, be off.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I'll come for you at six o'clock punctually.\" Erkel made a courteous\r\nbow and walked deliberately downstairs.\r\n\r\n\"Little fool!\" Shatov could not help shouting after him from the top.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" responded the lad from the bottom.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, you can go.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you said something.\"\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nErkel was a \"little fool\" who was only lacking in the higher form\r\nof reason, the ruling power of the intellect; but of the lesser, the\r\nsubordinate reasoning faculties, he had plenty--even to the point of\r\ncunning.","Fanatically, childishly devoted to \"the cause\" or rather in\r\nreality to Pyotr Verhovensky, he acted on the instructions given to him\r\nwhen at the meeting of the quintet they had agreed and had distributed\r\nthe various duties for the next day. When Pyotr Stepanovitch gave him\r\nthe job of messenger, he succeeded in talking to him aside for ten\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nA craving for active service was characteristic of this shallow,\r\nunreflecting nature, which was forever yearning to follow the lead\r\nof another man's will, of course for the good of \"the common\" or \"the\r\ngreat\" cause.","Not that that made any difference, for little fanatics\r\nlike Erkel can never imagine serving a cause except by identifying\r\nit with the person who, to their minds, is the expression of it. The\r\nsensitive, affectionate and kind-hearted Erkel was perhaps the most\r\ncallous of Shatov's would-be murderers, and, though he had no personal\r\nspite against him, he would have been present at his murder without the\r\nquiver of an eyelid.","He had been instructed, for instance, to have a\r\ngood look at Shatov's surroundings while carrying out his commission,\r\nand when Shatov, receiving him at the top of the stairs, blurted out to\r\nhim, probably unaware in the heat of the moment, that his wife had come\r\nback to him--Erkel had the instinctive cunning to avoid displaying the\r\nslightest curiosity, though the idea flashed through his mind that the\r\nfact of his wife's return was of great importance for the success of\r\ntheir undertaking.","And so it was in reality; it was only that fact that saved the\r\n\"scoundrels\" from Shatov's carrying out his intention, and at the same\r\ntime helped them \"to get rid of him.\" To begin with, it agitated Shatov,\r\nthrew him out of his regular routine, and deprived him of his usual\r\nclear-sightedness and caution. Any idea of his own danger would be the\r\nlast thing to enter his head at this moment when he was absorbed with\r\nsuch different considerations.","On the contrary, he eagerly believed that\r\nPyotr Verhovensky was running away the next day: it fell in exactly with\r\nhis suspicions! Returning to the room he sat down again in a corner,\r\nleaned his elbows on his knees and hid his face in his hands. Bitter\r\nthoughts tormented him....\r\n\r\nThen he would raise his head again and go on tiptoe to look at her.\r\n\"Good God! she will be in a fever by to-morrow morning; perhaps it's\r\nbegun already! She must have caught cold.","She is not accustomed to this\r\nawful climate, and then a third-class carriage, the storm, the rain, and\r\nshe has such a thin little pelisse, no wrap at all.... And to leave\r\nher like this, to abandon her in her helplessness! Her bag, too, her\r\nbag--what a tiny, light thing, all crumpled up, scarcely weighs ten\r\npounds! Poor thing, how worn out she is, how much she's been through!\r\nShe is proud, that's why she won't complain.","But she is irritable, very\r\nirritable. It's illness; an angel will grow irritable in illness. What\r\na dry forehead, it must be hot--how dark she is under the eyes,\r\nand... and yet how beautiful the oval of her face is and her rich hair,\r\nhow...\"\r\n\r\nAnd he made haste to turn away his eyes, to walk away as though he were\r\nfrightened at the very idea of seeing in her anything but an unhappy,\r\nexhausted fellow-creature who needed _help_--\"how could he think of\r\n_hopes_, oh, how mean, how base is man!\" And he would go back to his\r\ncorner, sit down, hide his face in his hands and again sink into dreams\r\nand reminiscences.",".. and again he was haunted by hopes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am tired, I am tired,\" he remembered her exclamations, her\r\nweak broken voice. \"Good God! Abandon her now, and she has only eighty\r\nkopecks; she held out her purse, a tiny old thing! She's come to look\r\nfor a job. What does she know about jobs? What do they know about\r\nRussia? Why, they are like naughty children, they've nothing but their\r\nown fancies made up by themselves, and she is angry, poor thing,\r\nthat Russia is not like their foreign dreams! The luckless, innocent\r\ncreatures!.",".. It's really cold here, though.\"\r\n\r\nHe remembered that she had complained, that he had promised to heat the\r\nstove. \"There are logs here, I can fetch them if only I don't wake her.\r\nBut I can do it without waking her. But what shall I do about the veal?\r\nWhen she gets up perhaps she will be hungry.... Well, that will do\r\nlater: Kirillov doesn't go to bed all night. What could I cover her\r\nwith, she is sleeping so soundly, but she must be cold, ah, she must be\r\ncold!\" And once more he went to look at her; her dress had worked up\r\na little and her right leg was half uncovered to the knee.","He suddenly\r\nturned away almost in dismay, took off his warm overcoat, and, remaining\r\nin his wretched old jacket, covered it up, trying not to look at it.\r\n\r\nA great deal of time was spent in righting the fire, stepping about\r\non tiptoe, looking at the sleeping woman, dreaming in the corner, then\r\nlooking at her again. Two or three hours had passed. During that time\r\nVerhovensky and Liputin had been at Kirillov's.","At last he, too, began\r\nto doze in the corner. He heard her groan; she waked up and called him;\r\nhe jumped up like a criminal.\r\n\r\n\"Marie, I was dropping asleep.... Ah, what a wretch I am, Marie!\"\r\n\r\nShe sat up, looking about her with wonder, seeming not to recognise\r\nwhere she was, and suddenly leapt up in indignation and anger.\r\n\r\n\"I've taken your bed, I fell asleep so tired I didn't know what I was\r\ndoing; how dared you not wake me? How could you dare imagine I meant to\r\nbe a burden to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"How could I wake you, Marie?\"\r\n\r\n\"You could, you ought to have! You've no other bed here, and I've taken\r\nyours.","You had no business to put me into a false position. Or do you\r\nsuppose that I've come to take advantage of your charity? Kindly get\r\ninto your bed at once and I'll lie down in the corner on some chairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Marie, there aren't chairs enough, and there's nothing to put on them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then simply oil the floor. Or you'll have to lie on the floor yourself.\r\nI want to lie on the floor at once, at once!\"\r\n\r\nShe stood up, tried to take a step, but suddenly a violent spasm of pain\r\ndeprived her of all power and all determination, and with a loud groan\r\nshe fell back on the bed.","Shatov ran up, but Marie, hiding her face in\r\nthe pillow, seized his hand and gripped and squeezed it with all her\r\nmight. This lasted a minute.\r\n\r\n\"Marie darling, there's a doctor Frenzel living here, a friend of\r\nmine.... I could run for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by nonsense? Tell me, Marie, what is it hurting you?\r\nFor we might try fomentations... on the stomach for instance....","I can\r\ndo that without a doctor.... Or else mustard poultices.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's this,\" she asked strangely, raising her head and looking at him\r\nin dismay.\r\n\r\n\"What's what, Marie?\" said Shatov, not understanding. \"What are you\r\nasking about? Good heavens! I am quite bewildered, excuse my not\r\nunderstanding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ach, let me alone; it's not your business to understand. And it would\r\nbe too absurd...\" she said with a bitter smile.","\"Talk to me about\r\nsomething. Walk about the room and talk. Don't stand over me and don't\r\nlook at me, I particularly ask you that for the five-hundredth time!\"\r\n\r\nShatov began walking up and down the room, looking at the floor, and\r\ndoing his utmost not to glance at her.\r\n\r\n\"There's--don't be angry, Marie, I entreat you--there's some veal here,\r\nand there's tea not far off.... You had so little before.","\"\r\n\r\nShe made an angry gesture of disgust. Shatov bit his tongue in despair.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, I intend to open a bookbinding business here, on rational\r\nco-operative principles. Since you live here what do you think of it,\r\nwould it be successful?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ech, Marie, people don't read books here, and there are none here at\r\nall. And are they likely to begin binding them!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"The local readers and inhabitants generally, Marie.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, speak more clearly. _They_ indeed, and one doesn't know who\r\nthey are. You don't know grammar!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's in the spirit of the language,\" Shatov muttered.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, get along with your spirit, you bore me. Why shouldn't the local\r\ninhabitant or reader have his books bound?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because reading books and having them bound are two different stages of\r\ndevelopment, and there's a vast gulf between them.","To begin with, a man\r\ngradually gets used to reading, in the course of ages of course, but\r\ntakes no care of his books and throws them about, not thinking them\r\nworth attention. But binding implies respect for books, and implies\r\nthat not only he has grown fond of reading, but that he looks upon it as\r\nsomething of value. That period has not been reached anywhere in Russia\r\nyet. In Europe books have been bound for a long while.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Though that's pedantic, anyway, it's not stupid, and reminds me of the\r\ntime three years ago; you used to be rather clever sometimes three years\r\nago.\"\r\n\r\nShe said this as disdainfully as her other capricious remarks.\r\n\r\n\"Marie, Marie,\" said Shatov, turning to her, much moved, \"oh, Marie!\r\nIf you only knew how much has happened in those three years! I heard\r\nafterwards that you despised me for changing my convictions.","But what\r\nare the men I've broken with? The enemies of all true life, out-of-date\r\nLiberals who are afraid of their own independence, the flunkeys\r\nof thought, the enemies of individuality and freedom, the decrepit\r\nadvocates of deadness and rottenness! All they have to offer is\r\nsenility, a glorious mediocrity of the most bourgeois kind, contemptible\r\nshallowness, a jealous equality, equality without individual dignity,\r\nequality as it's understood by flunkeys or by the French in '93.","And\r\nthe worst of it is there are swarms of scoundrels among them, swarms of\r\nscoundrels!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there are a lot of scoundrels,\" she brought out abruptly with\r\npainful effort. She lay stretched out, motionless, as though afraid\r\nto move, with her head thrown back on the pillow, rather on one side,\r\nstaring at the ceiling with exhausted but glowing eyes. Her face was\r\npale, her lips were dry and hot.","\"You recognise it, Marie, you recognise it,\" cried Shatov. She tried to\r\nshake her head, and suddenly the same spasm came over her again. Again\r\nshe hid her face in the pillow, and again for a full minute she squeezed\r\nShatov's hand till it hurt. He had run up, beside himself with alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Marie, Marie! But it may be very serious, Marie!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet... I won't have it, I won't have it,\" she screamed almost\r\nfuriously, turning her face upwards again.","\"Don't dare to look at me\r\nwith your sympathy! Walk about the room, say something, talk....\"\r\n\r\nShatov began muttering something again, like one distraught.\r\n\r\n\"What do you do here?\" she asked, interrupting him with contemptuous\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\n\"I work in a merchant's office. I could get a fair amount of money even\r\nhere if I cared to, Marie.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the better for you....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't suppose I meant anything, Marie.","I said it without thinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do you do besides? What are you preaching? You can't exist\r\nwithout preaching, that's your character!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am preaching God, Marie.\"\r\n\r\n\"In whom you don't believe yourself. I never could see the idea of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's leave that, Marie; we'll talk of that later.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of person was this Marya Timofyevna here?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll talk of that later too, Marie.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't dare to say such things to me! Is it true that her death may have\r\nbeen caused by... the wickedness... of these people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a doubt of it,\" growled Shatov.\r\n\r\nMarie suddenly raised her head and cried out painfully:\r\n\r\n\"Don't dare speak of that to me again, don't dare to, never, never!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she fell back in bed again, overcome by the same convulsive agony;\r\nit was the third time, but this time her groans were louder, in fact she\r\nscreamed.","\"Oh, you insufferable man! Oh, you unbearable man,\" she cried, tossing\r\nabout recklessly, and pushing away Shatov as he bent over her.\r\n\r\n\"Marie, I'll do anything you like.... I'll walk about and talk....\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely you must see that it has begun!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's begun, Marie?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell! Do I know anything about it?... I curse myself! Oh,\r\ncurse it all from the beginning!\"\r\n\r\n\"Marie, if you'd tell me what's beginning.",".. or else I... if you don't,\r\nwhat am I to make of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a useless, theoretical babbler. Oh, curse everything on earth!\"\r\n\r\n\"Marie, Marie!\" He seriously thought that she was beginning to go mad.\r\n\r\n\"Surely you must see that I am in the agonies of childbirth,\" she said,\r\nsitting up and gazing at him with a terrible, hysterical vindictiveness\r\nthat distorted her whole face. \"I curse him before he is born, this\r\nchild!\"\r\n\r\n\"Marie,\" cried Shatov, realising at last what it meant.","\"Marie... but\r\nwhy didn't you tell me before.\" He pulled himself together at once and\r\nseized his cap with an air of vigorous determination.\r\n\r\n\"How could I tell when I came in here? Should I have come to you if I'd\r\nknown? I was told it would be another ten days! Where are you going?...\r\nWhere are you going? You mustn't dare!\"\r\n\r\n\"To fetch a midwife! I'll sell the revolver. We must get money before\r\nanything else now.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't dare to do anything, don't dare to fetch a midwife! Bring a\r\npeasant woman, any old woman, I've eighty kopecks in my purse....\r\nPeasant women have babies without midwives.... And if I die, so much the\r\nbetter....\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall have a midwife and an old woman too. But how am I to leave\r\nyou alone, Marie!\"\r\n\r\nBut reflecting that it was better to leave her alone now in spite of\r\nher desperate state than to leave her without help later, he paid\r\nno attention to her groans, nor her angry exclamations, but rushed\r\ndownstairs, hurrying all he could.","III\r\n\r\nFirst of all he went to Kirillov. It was by now about one o'clock in the\r\nnight. Kirillov was standing in the middle of the room.\r\n\r\n\"Kirillov, my wife is in childbirth.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Childbirth, bearing a child!\"\r\n\r\n\"You... are not mistaken?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, no, she is in agonies! I want a woman, any old woman, I must\r\nhave one at once.... Can you get one now? You used to have a lot of old\r\nwomen.","...\"\r\n\r\n\"Very sorry that I am no good at childbearing,\" Kirillov answered\r\nthoughtfully; \"that is, not at childbearing, but at doing anything for\r\nchildbearing... or... no, I don't know how to say it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean you can't assist at a confinement yourself? But that's not\r\nwhat I've come for. An old woman, I want a woman, a nurse, a servant!\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall have an old woman, but not directly, perhaps.",".. If you like\r\nI'll come instead....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, impossible; I am running to Madame Virginsky, the midwife, now.\"\r\n\r\n\"A horrid woman!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, Kirillov, yes, but she is the best of them all. Yes, it'll all\r\nbe without reverence, without gladness, with contempt, with abuse, with\r\nblasphemy in the presence of so great a mystery, the coming of a new\r\ncreature! Oh, she is cursing it already!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you like I'll.","..\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, but while I'm running (oh, I'll make Madame Virginsky come),\r\nwill you go to the foot of my staircase and quietly listen? But don't\r\nventure to go in, you'll frighten her; don't go in on any account, you\r\nmust only listen... in case anything dreadful happens. If anything very\r\nbad happens, then run in.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand. I've another rouble. Here it is. I meant to have a fowl\r\nto-morrow, but now I don't want to, make haste, run with all your might.","There's a samovar all the night.\"\r\n\r\nKirillov knew nothing of the present design against Shatov, nor had he\r\nhad any idea in the past of the degree of danger that threatened him.\r\nHe only knew that Shatov had some old scores with \"those people,\"\r\nand although he was to some extent involved with them himself through\r\ninstructions he had received from abroad (not that these were of\r\nmuch consequence, however, for he had never taken any direct share in\r\nanything), yet of late he had given it all up, having left off doing\r\nanything especially for the \"cause,\" and devoted himself entirely to a\r\nlife of contemplation.","Although Pyotr Stepanovitch had at the meeting\r\ninvited Liputin to go with him to Kirillov's to make sure that the\r\nlatter would take upon himself, at a given moment, the responsibility\r\nfor the \"Shatov business,\" yet in his interview with Kirillov he had\r\nsaid no word about Shatov nor alluded to him in any way--probably\r\nconsidering it impolitic to do so, and thinking that Kirillov could\r\nnot be relied upon.","He put off speaking about it till next day, when it\r\nwould be all over and would therefore not matter to Kirillov; such at\r\nleast was Pyotr Stepanovitch's judgment of him. Liputin, too, was\r\nstruck by the fact that Shatov was not mentioned in spite of what Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch had promised, but he was too much agitated to protest.\r\n\r\nShatov ran like a hurricane to Virginsky's house, cursing the distance\r\nand feeling it endless.","He had to knock a long time at Virginsky's; every one had been asleep a\r\nlong while. But Shatov did not scruple to bang at the shutters with\r\nall his might. The dog chained up in the yard dashed about barking\r\nfuriously. The dogs caught it up all along the street, and there was a\r\nregular babel of barking.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you knocking and what do you want?\" Shatov heard at the window\r\nat last Virginsky's gentle voice, betraying none of the resentment\r\nappropriate to the \"outrage.","\" The shutter was pushed back a little and\r\nthe casement was opened.\r\n\r\n\"Who's there, what scoundrel is it?\" shrilled a female voice which\r\nbetrayed all the resentment appropriate to the \"outrage.\" It was the old\r\nmaid, Virginsky's relation.\r\n\r\n\"I am Shatov, my wife has come back to me and she is just confined....\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let her be, get along.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've come for Arina Prohorovna; I won't go without Arina Prohorovna!\"\r\n\r\n\"She can't attend to every one.","Practice at night is a special line.\r\nTake yourself off to Maksheyev's and don't dare to make that din,\"\r\nrattled the exasperated female voice. He could hear Virginsky checking\r\nher; but the old maid pushed him away and would not desist.\r\n\r\n\"I am not going away!\" Shatov cried again.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a little, wait a little,\" Virginsky cried at last, overpowering\r\nthe lady. \"I beg you to wait five minutes, Shatov.","I'll wake Arina\r\nProhorovna. Please don't knock and don't shout.... Oh, how awful it all\r\nis!\"\r\n\r\nAfter five endless minutes, Arina Prohorovna made her appearance.\r\n\r\n\"Has your wife come?\" Shatov heard her voice at the window, and to his\r\nsurprise it was not at all ill-tempered, only as usual peremptory, but\r\nArina Prohorovna could not speak except in a peremptory tone.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my wife, and she is in labour.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Marya Ignatyevna?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Marya Ignatyevna. Of course it's Marya Ignatyevna.\"\r\n\r\nA silence followed. Shatov waited. He heard a whispering in the house.\r\n\r\n\"Has she been here long?\" Madame Virginsky asked again.\r\n\r\n\"She came this evening at eight o'clock. Please make haste.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he heard whispering, as though they were consulting. \"Listen, you\r\nare not making a mistake? Did she send you for me herself?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, she didn't send for you, she wants a peasant woman, so as not to\r\nburden me with expense, but don't be afraid, I'll pay you.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, I'll come, whether you pay or not. I always thought highly\r\nof Marya Ignatyevna for the independence of her sentiments, though\r\nperhaps she won't remember me. Have you got the most necessary things?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've nothing, but I'll get everything, everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is something generous even in these people,\" Shatov reflected,\r\nas he set off to Lyamshin's. \"The convictions and the man are two very\r\ndifferent things, very likely I've been very unfair to them!.",".. We are\r\nall to blame, we are all to blame... and if only all were convinced of\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\nHe had not to knock long at Lyamshin's; the latter, to Shatov's\r\nsurprise, opened his casement at once, jumping out of bed, barefoot\r\nand in his night-clothes at the risk of catching cold; and he was\r\nhypochondriacal and always anxious about his health. But there was\r\na special cause for such alertness and haste: Lyamshin had been in a\r\ntremor all the evening, and had not been able to sleep for excitement\r\nafter the meeting of the quintet; he was haunted by the dread\r\nof uninvited and undesired visitors.","The news of Shatov's giving\r\ninformation tormented him more than anything.... And suddenly there\r\nwas this terrible loud knocking at the window as though to justify his\r\nfears.\r\n\r\nHe was so frightened at seeing Shatov that he at once slammed the\r\ncasement and jumped back into bed. Shatov began furiously knocking and\r\nshouting.\r\n\r\n\"How dare you knock like that in the middle of the night?\" shouted\r\nLyamshin, in a threatening voice, though he was numb with fear, when at\r\nleast two minutes later he ventured to open the casement again, and was\r\nat last convinced that Shatov had come alone.","\"Here's your revolver for you; take it back, give me fifteen roubles.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, are you drunk? This is outrageous, I shall simply\r\ncatch cold. Wait a minute, I'll just throw my rug over me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me fifteen roubles at once. If you don't give it me, I'll knock\r\nand shout till daybreak; I'll break your window-frame.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'll shout police and you'll be taken to the lock-up.\"\r\n\r\n\"And am I dumb? Can't I shout 'police' too? Which of us has most reason\r\nto be afraid of the police, you or I?\"\r\n\r\n\"And you can hold such contemptible opinions! I know what you are\r\nhinting at.","... Stop, stop, for God's sake don't go on knocking! Upon my\r\nword, who has money at night? What do you want money for, unless you are\r\ndrunk?\"\r\n\r\n\"My wife has come back. I've taken ten roubles off the price, I haven't\r\nfired it once; take the revolver, take it this minute!\"\r\n\r\nLyamshin mechanically put his hand out of the casement and took the\r\nrevolver; he waited a little, and suddenly thrusting his head out of the\r\ncasement, and with a shiver running down his spine, faltered as though\r\nhe were beside himself.","\"You are lying, your wife hasn't come back to you.... It's... it's\r\nsimply that you want to run away.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a fool. Where should I run to? It's for your Pyotr Verhovensky\r\nto run away, not for me. I've just been to the midwife, Madame\r\nVirginsky, and she consented at once to come to me. You can ask them. My\r\nwife is in agony; I need the money; give it me!\"\r\n\r\nA swarm of ideas flared up in Lyamshin's crafty mind like a shower of\r\nfireworks.","It all suddenly took a different colour, though still panic\r\nprevented him from reflecting.\r\n\r\n\"But how... you are not living with your wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll break your skull for questions like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear, I understand, forgive me, I was struck all of a heap.... But I\r\nunderstand, I understand... is Arina Prohorovna really coming? You said\r\njust now that she had gone? You know, that's not true. You see, you see,\r\nyou see what lies you tell at every step.","\"\r\n\r\n\"By now, she must be with my wife... don't keep me... it's not my fault\r\nyou are a fool.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a lie, I am not a fool. Excuse me, I really can't...\"\r\n\r\nAnd utterly distraught he began shutting the casement again for the\r\nthird time, but Shatov gave such a yell that he put his head out again.\r\n\r\n\"But this is simply an unprovoked assault! What do you want of me, what\r\nis it, what is it, formulate it? And think, only think, it's the middle\r\nof the night!\"\r\n\r\n\"I want fifteen roubles, you sheep's-head!\"\r\n\r\n\"But perhaps I don't care to take back the revolver.","You have no right\r\nto force me. You bought the thing and the matter is settled, and you've\r\nno right.... I can't give you a sum like that in the night, anyhow.\r\nWhere am I to get a sum like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"You always have money. I've taken ten roubles off the price, but every\r\none knows you are a skinflint.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come the day after to-morrow, do you hear, the day after to-morrow at\r\ntwelve o'clock, and I'll give you the whole of it, that will do, won't\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\nShatov knocked furiously at the window-frame for the third time.","\"Give me ten roubles, and to-morrow early the other five.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, the day after to-morrow the other five, to-morrow I swear I shan't\r\nhave it. You'd better not come, you'd better not come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me ten, you scoundrel!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are you so abusive. Wait a minute, I must light a candle; you've\r\nbroken the window.... Nobody swears like that at night. Here you are!\"\r\nHe held a note to him out of the window.","Shatov seized it--it was a note for five roubles.\r\n\r\n\"On my honour I can't do more, if you were to murder me, I couldn't; the\r\nday after to-morrow I can give you it all, but now I can do nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not going away!\" roared Shatov.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, take it, here's some more, see, here's some more, and I\r\nwon't give more. You can shout at the top of your voice, but I won't\r\ngive more, I won't, whatever happens, I won't, I won't.","\"\r\n\r\nHe was in a perfect frenzy, desperate and perspiring. The two notes\r\nhe had just given him were each for a rouble. Shatov had seven roubles\r\naltogether now.\r\n\r\n\"Well, damn you, then, I'll come to-morrow. I'll thrash you, Lyamshin,\r\nif you don't give me the other eight.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't find me at home, you fool!\" Lyamshin reflected quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Stay, stay!\" he shouted frantically after Shatov, who was already\r\nrunning off.","\"Stay, come back. Tell me please, is it true what you said\r\nthat your wife has come back?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fool!\" cried Shatov, with a gesture of disgust, and ran home as hard as\r\nhe could.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nI may mention that Anna Prohorovna knew nothing of the resolutions\r\nthat had been taken at the meeting the day before. On returning home\r\noverwhelmed and exhausted, Virginsky had not ventured to tell her of the\r\ndecision that had been taken, yet he could not refrain from telling her\r\nhalf--that is, all that Verhovensky had told them of the certainty of\r\nShatov's intention to betray them; but he added at the same time that\r\nhe did not quite believe it.","Arina Prohorovna was terribly alarmed. This\r\nwas why she decided at once to go when Shatov came to fetch her, though\r\nshe was tired out, as she had been hard at work at a confinement all the\r\nnight before. She had always been convinced that \"a wretched creature\r\nlike Shatov was capable of any political baseness,\" but the arrival of\r\nMarya Ignatyevna put things in a different light. Shatov's alarm, the\r\ndespairing tone of his entreaties, the way he begged for help, clearly\r\nshowed a complete change of feeling in the traitor: a man who was ready\r\nto betray himself merely for the sake of ruining others would, she\r\nthought, have had a different air and tone.","In short, Arina Prohorovna\r\nresolved to look into the matter for herself, with her own eyes.\r\nVirginsky was very glad of her decision, he felt as though a\r\nhundredweight had been lifted off him! He even began to feel\r\nhopeful: Shatov's appearance seemed to him utterly incompatible with\r\nVerhovensky's supposition.\r\n\r\nShatov was not mistaken: on getting home he found Arina Prohorovna\r\nalready with Marie.","She had just arrived, had contemptuously dismissed\r\nKirillov, whom she found hanging about the foot of the stairs, had\r\nhastily introduced herself to Marie, who had not recognised her as\r\nher former acquaintance, found her in \"a very bad way,\" that is\r\nill-tempered, irritable and in \"a state of cowardly despair,\" and within\r\nfive minutes had completely silenced all her protests.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you keep on that you don't want an expensive midwife?\" she was\r\nsaying at the moment when Shatov came in.","\"That's perfect nonsense,\r\nit's a false idea arising from the abnormality of your condition. In the\r\nhands of some ordinary old woman, some peasant midwife, you'd have fifty\r\nchances of going wrong and then you'd have more bother and expense than\r\nwith a regular midwife. How do you know I am an expensive midwife? You\r\ncan pay afterwards; I won't charge you much and I answer for my success;\r\nyou won't die in my hands, I've seen worse cases than yours.","And I can\r\nsend the baby to a foundling asylum to-morrow, if you like, and then to\r\nbe brought up in the country, and that's all it will mean. And meantime\r\nyou'll grow strong again, take up some rational work, and in a very\r\nshort time you'll repay Shatov for sheltering you and for the expense,\r\nwhich will not be so great.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not that... I've no right to be a burden....\"\r\n\r\n\"Rational feelings and worthy of a citizen, but you can take my word for\r\nit, Shatov will spend scarcely anything, if he is willing to become ever\r\nso little a man of sound ideas instead of the fantastic person he is.","He has only not to do anything stupid, not to raise an alarm, not to run\r\nabout the town with his tongue out. If we don't restrain him he will be\r\nknocking up all the doctors of the town before the morning; he waked\r\nall the dogs in my street. There's no need of doctors I've said already.\r\nI'll answer for everything. You can hire an old woman if you like\r\nto wait on you, that won't cost much. Though he too can do something\r\nbesides the silly things he's been doing.","He's got hands and feet, he\r\ncan run to the chemist's without offending your feelings by being too\r\nbenevolent. As though it were a case of benevolence! Hasn't he brought\r\nyou into this position? Didn't he make you break with the family in\r\nwhich you were a governess, with the egoistic object of marrying you? We\r\nheard of it, you know... though he did run for me like one possessed and\r\nyell so all the street could hear.","I won't force myself upon anyone and\r\nhave come only for your sake, on the principle that all of us are bound\r\nto hold together! And I told him so before I left the house. If you\r\nthink I am in the way, good-bye, I only hope you won't have trouble\r\nwhich might so easily be averted.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she positively got up from the chair. Marie was so helpless, in such\r\npain, and--the truth must be confessed--so frightened of what was before\r\nher that she dared not let her go.","But this woman was suddenly hateful\r\nto her, what she said was not what she wanted, there was something quite\r\ndifferent in Marie's soul. Yet the prediction that she might possibly\r\ndie in the hands of an inexperienced peasant woman overcame her\r\naversion. But she made up for it by being more exacting and more\r\nruthless than ever with Shatov. She ended by forbidding him not only to\r\nlook at her but even to stand facing her.","Her pains became more violent.\r\nHer curses, her abuse became more and more frantic.\r\n\r\n\"Ech, we'll send him away,\" Arina Prohorovna rapped out. \"I don't know\r\nwhat he looks like, he is simply frightening you; he is as white as a\r\ncorpse! What is it to you, tell me please, you absurd fellow? What a\r\nfarce!\"\r\n\r\nShatov made no reply, he made up his mind to say nothing. \"I've seen\r\nmany a foolish father, half crazy in such cases.","But they, at any\r\nrate...\"\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet or leave me to die! Don't say another word! I won't have it, I\r\nwon't have it!\" screamed Marie.\r\n\r\n\"It's impossible not to say another word, if you are not out of your\r\nmind, as I think you are in your condition. We must talk of what we\r\nwant, anyway: tell me, have you anything ready? You answer, Shatov, she\r\nis incapable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me what's needed?\"\r\n\r\n\"That means you've nothing ready.","\" She reckoned up all that was quite\r\nnecessary, and one must do her the justice to say she only asked for\r\nwhat was absolutely indispensable, the barest necessaries. Some things\r\nShatov had. Marie took out her key and held it out to him, for him to\r\nlook in her bag. As his hands shook he was longer than he should have\r\nbeen opening the unfamiliar lock. Marie flew into a rage, but when Arina\r\nProhorovna rushed up to take the key from him, she would not allow her\r\non any account to look into her bag and with peevish cries and tears\r\ninsisted that no one should open the bag but Shatov.","Some things he had to fetch from Kirillov's. No sooner had Shatov turned\r\nto go for them than she began frantically calling him back and was only\r\nquieted when Shatov had rushed impetuously back from the stairs, and\r\nexplained that he should only be gone a minute to fetch something\r\nindispensable and would be back at once.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my lady, it's hard to please you,\" laughed Arina Prohorovna, \"one\r\nminute he must stand with his face to the wall and not dare to look at\r\nyou, and the next he mustn't be gone for a minute, or you begin crying.","He may begin to imagine something. Come, come, don't be silly, don't\r\nblubber, I was laughing, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"He won't dare to imagine anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut, tut, tut, if he didn't love you like a sheep he wouldn't run about\r\nthe streets with his tongue out and wouldn't have roused all the dogs in\r\nthe town. He broke my window-frame.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nHe found Kirillov still pacing up and down his room so preoccupied that\r\nhe had forgotten the arrival of Shatov's wife, and heard what he said\r\nwithout understanding him.","\"Oh, yes!\" he recollected suddenly, as though tearing himself with an\r\neffort and only for an instant from some absorbing idea, \"yes... an\r\nold woman.... A wife or an old woman? Stay a minute: a wife and an old\r\nwoman, is that it? I remember. I've been, the old woman will come, only\r\nnot just now. Take the pillow. Is there anything else? Yes.... Stay, do\r\nyou have moments of the eternal harmony, Shatov?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know, Kirillov, you mustn't go on staying up every night.","\"\r\n\r\nKirillov came out of his reverie and, strange to say, spoke far more\r\ncoherently than he usually did; it was clear that he had formulated it\r\nlong ago and perhaps written it down.\r\n\r\n\"There are seconds--they come five or six at a time--when you suddenly\r\nfeel the presence of the eternal harmony perfectly attained. It's\r\nsomething not earthly--I don't mean in the sense that it's heavenly--but\r\nin that sense that man cannot endure it in his earthly aspect.","He must\r\nbe physically changed or die. This feeling is clear and unmistakable;\r\nit's as though you apprehend all nature and suddenly say, 'Yes, that's\r\nright.' God, when He created the world, said at the end of each day\r\nof creation, 'Yes, it's right, it's good.' It... it's not being deeply\r\nmoved, but simply joy. You don't forgive anything because there is no\r\nmore need of forgiveness. It's not that you love--oh, there's something\r\nin it higher than love--what's most awful is that it's terribly clear\r\nand such joy.","If it lasted more than five seconds, the soul could\r\nnot endure it and must perish. In those five seconds I live through a\r\nlifetime, and I'd give my whole life for them, because they are worth\r\nit. To endure ten seconds one must be physically changed. I think man\r\nought to give up having children--what's the use of children, what's the\r\nuse of evolution when the goal has been attained? In the gospel it is\r\nwritten that there will be no child-bearing in the resurrection, but\r\nthat men will be like the angels of the Lord.","That's a hint. Is your\r\nwife bearing a child?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kirillov, does this often happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Once in three days, or once a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you have fits, perhaps?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you will. Be careful, Kirillov. I've heard that's just how fits\r\nbegin. An epileptic described exactly that sensation before a fit, word\r\nfor word as you've done. He mentioned five seconds, too, and said that\r\nmore could not be endured.","Remember Mahomet's pitcher from which no drop\r\nof water was spilt while he circled Paradise on his horse. That was a\r\ncase of five seconds too; that's too much like your eternal harmony, and\r\nMahomet was an epileptic. Be careful, Kirillov, it's epilepsy!\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't have time,\" Kirillov smiled gently.\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThe night was passing. Shatov was sent hither and thither, abused,\r\ncalled back. Marie was reduced to the most abject terror for life.","She\r\nscreamed that she wanted to live, that \"she must, she must,\" and was\r\nafraid to die. \"I don't want to, I don't want to!\" she repeated. If\r\nArina Prohorovna had not been there, things would have gone very badly.\r\nBy degrees she gained complete control of the patient--who began to obey\r\nevery word, every order from her like a child. Arina Prohorovna ruled by\r\nsternness not by kindness, but she was first-rate at her work.","It began\r\nto get light... Arina Prohorovna suddenly imagined that Shatov had just\r\nrun out on to the stairs to say his prayers and began laughing. Marie\r\nlaughed too, spitefully, malignantly, as though such laughter relieved\r\nher. At last they drove Shatov away altogether. A damp, cold morning\r\ndawned. He pressed his face to the wall in the corner just as he had\r\ndone the evening before when Erkel came.","He was trembling like a leaf,\r\nafraid to think, but his mind caught at every thought as it does in\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nHe was continually being carried away by day-dreams, which snapped off\r\nshort like a rotten thread. From the room came no longer groans but\r\nawful animal cries, unendurable, incredible. He tried to stop up his\r\nears, but could not, and he fell on his knees, repeating unconsciously,\r\n\"Marie, Marie!\" Then suddenly he heard a cry, a new cry, which made\r\nShatov start and jump up from his knees, the cry of a baby, a weak\r\ndiscordant cry.","He crossed himself and rushed into the room. Arina\r\nProhorovna held in her hands a little red wrinkled creature, screaming,\r\nand moving its little arms and legs, fearfully helpless, and looking\r\nas though it could be blown away by a puff of wind, but screaming and\r\nseeming to assert its full right to live. Marie was lying as though\r\ninsensible, but a minute later she opened her eyes, and bent a strange,\r\nstrange look on Shatov: it was something quite new, that look.","What it\r\nmeant exactly he was not able to understand yet, but he had never known\r\nsuch a look on her face before.\r\n\r\n\"Is it a boy? Is it a boy?\" she asked Arina Prohorovna in an exhausted\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"It is a boy,\" the latter shouted in reply, as she bound up the child.\r\n\r\nWhen she had bound him up and was about to lay him across the bed\r\nbetween the two pillows, she gave him to Shatov for a minute to hold.","Marie signed to him on the sly as though afraid of Arina Prohorovna. He\r\nunderstood at once and brought the baby to show her.\r\n\r\n\"How... pretty he is,\" she whispered weakly with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Foo, what does he look like,\" Arina Prohorovna laughed gaily in\r\ntriumph, glancing at Shatov's face. \"What a funny face!\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be merry, Arina Prohorovna.... It's a great joy,\" Shatov\r\nfaltered with an expression of idiotic bliss, radiant at the phrase\r\nMarie had uttered about the child.","\"Where does the great joy come in?\" said Arina Prohorovna\r\ngood-humouredly, bustling about, clearing up, and working like a\r\nconvict.\r\n\r\n\"The mysterious coming of a new creature, a great and inexplicable\r\nmystery; and what a pity it is, Arina Prohorovna, that you don't\r\nunderstand it.\"\r\n\r\nShatov spoke in an incoherent, stupefied and ecstatic way. Something\r\nseemed to be tottering in his head and welling up from his soul apart\r\nfrom his own will.","\"There were two and now there's a third human being, a new spirit,\r\nfinished and complete, unlike the handiwork of man; a new thought and a\r\nnew love... it's positively frightening.... And there's nothing grander\r\nin the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ech, what nonsense he talks! It's simply a further development of\r\nthe organism, and there's nothing else in it, no mystery,\" said Arina\r\nProhorovna with genuine and good-humoured laughter.","\"If you talk like\r\nthat, every fly is a mystery. But I tell you what: superfluous people\r\nought not to be born. We must first remould everything so that they\r\nwon't be superfluous and then bring them into the world. As it is, we\r\nshall have to take him to the Foundling, the day after to-morrow....\r\nThough that's as it should be.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will never let him go to the Foundling,\" Shatov pronounced\r\nresolutely, staring at the floor.","\"You adopt him as your son?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is my son.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course he is a Shatov, legally he is a Shatov, and there's no need\r\nfor you to pose as a humanitarian. Men can't get on without fine words.\r\nThere, there, it's all right, but look here, my friends,\" she added,\r\nhaving finished clearing up at last, \"it's time for me to go. I'll come\r\nagain this morning, and again in the evening if necessary, but now,\r\nsince everything has gone off so well, I must run off to my other\r\npatients, they've been expecting me long ago.","I believe you got an old\r\nwoman somewhere, Shatov; an old woman is all very well, but don't you,\r\nher tender husband, desert her; sit beside her, you may be of use; Marya\r\nIgnatyevna won't drive you away, I fancy.... There, there, I was only\r\nlaughing.\"\r\n\r\nAt the gate, to which Shatov accompanied her, she added to him alone.\r\n\r\n\"You've given me something to laugh at for the rest of my life; I shan't\r\ncharge you anything; I shall laugh at you in my sleep! I have never seen\r\nanything funnier than you last night.","\"\r\n\r\nShe went off very well satisfied. Shatov's appearance and conversation\r\nmade it as clear as daylight that this man \"was going in for being a\r\nfather and was a ninny.\" She ran home on purpose to tell Virginsky about\r\nit, though it was shorter and more direct to go to another patient.\r\n\r\n\"Marie, she told you not to go to sleep for a little time, though, I\r\nsee, it's very hard for you,\" Shatov began timidly.","\"I'll sit here by\r\nthe window and take care of you, shall I?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he sat down, by the window behind the sofa so that she could not see\r\nhim. But before a minute had passed she called him and fretfully asked\r\nhim to arrange the pillow. He began arranging it. She looked angrily at\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\n\"That's not right, that's not right.... What hands!\"\r\n\r\nShatov did it again.\r\n\r\n\"Stoop down to me,\" she said wildly, trying hard not to look at him.","He started but stooped down.\r\n\r\n\"More... not so... nearer,\" and suddenly her left arm was impulsively\r\nthrown round his neck and he felt her warm moist kiss on his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Marie!\"\r\n\r\nHer lips were quivering, she was struggling with herself, but suddenly\r\nshe raised herself and said with flashing eyes:\r\n\r\n\"Nikolay Stavrogin is a scoundrel!\" And she fell back helplessly with\r\nher face in the pillow, sobbing hysterically, and tightly squeezing\r\nShatov's hand in hers.","From that moment she would not let him leave her; she insisted on his\r\nsitting by her pillow. She could not talk much but she kept gazing at\r\nhim and smiling blissfully. She seemed suddenly to have become a silly\r\ngirl. Everything seemed transformed. Shatov cried like a boy, then\r\ntalked of God knows what, wildly, crazily, with inspiration, kissed\r\nher hands; she listened entranced, perhaps not understanding him, but\r\ncaressingly ruffling his hair with her weak hand, smoothing it and\r\nadmiring it.","He talked about Kirillov, of how they would now begin \"a\r\nnew life\" for good, of the existence of God, of the goodness of all men.\r\n... She took out the child again to gaze at it rapturously.\r\n\r\n\"Marie,\" he cried, as he held the child in his arms, \"all the old\r\nmadness, shame, and deadness is over, isn't it? Let us work hard and\r\nbegin a new life, the three of us, yes, yes!... Oh, by the way, what\r\nshall we call him, Marie?\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we call him?\" she repeated with surprise, and there was a\r\nsudden look of terrible grief in her face.","She clasped her hands, looked reproachfully at Shatov and hid her face\r\nin the pillow.\r\n\r\n\"Marie, what is it?\" he cried with painful alarm.\r\n\r\n\"How could you, how could you... Oh, you ungrateful man!\"\r\n\r\n\"Marie, forgive me, Marie... I only asked you what his name should be. I\r\ndon't know....\"\r\n\r\n\"Ivan, Ivan.\" She raised her flushed and tear-stained face. \"How could\r\nyou suppose we should call him by another _horrible_ name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Marie, calm yourself; oh, what a nervous state you are in!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's rude again, putting it down to my nerves.","I bet that if I'd said\r\nhis name was to be that other... horrible name, you'd have agreed\r\nat once and not have noticed it even! Oh, men, the mean ungrateful\r\ncreatures, they are all alike!\"\r\n\r\nA minute later, of course, they were reconciled. Shatov persuaded her to\r\nhave a nap. She fell asleep but still kept his hand in hers; she waked\r\nup frequently, looked at him, as though afraid he would go away, and\r\ndropped asleep again.","Kirillov sent an old woman \"to congratulate them,\" as well as some hot\r\ntea, some freshly cooked cutlets, and some broth and white bread for\r\nMarya Ignatyevna. The patient sipped the broth greedily, the old woman\r\nundid the baby's wrappings and swaddled it afresh, Marie made Shatov\r\nhave a cutlet too.\r\n\r\nTime was passing. Shatov, exhausted, fell asleep himself in his chair,\r\nwith his head on Marie's pillow.","So they were found by Arina Prohorovna,\r\nwho kept her word. She waked them up gaily, asked Marie some necessary\r\nquestions, examined the baby, and again forbade Shatov to leave her.\r\nThen, jesting at the \"happy couple,\" with a shade of contempt and\r\nsuperciliousness she went away as well satisfied as before.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark when Shatov waked up. He made haste to light the\r\ncandle and ran for the old woman; but he had hardly begun to go down the\r\nstairs when he was struck by the sound of the soft, deliberate steps of\r\nsomeone coming up towards him.","Erkel came in.\r\n\r\n\"Don't come in,\" whispered Shatov, and impulsively seizing him by the\r\nhand he drew him back towards the gate. \"Wait here, I'll come directly,\r\nI'd completely forgotten you, completely! Oh, how you brought it back!\"\r\n\r\nHe was in such haste that he did not even run in to Kirillov's, but\r\nonly called the old woman. Marie was in despair and indignation that \"he\r\ncould dream of leaving her alone.","\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" he cried ecstatically, \"this is the very last step! And then for\r\na new life and we'll never, never think of the old horrors again!\"\r\n\r\nHe somehow appeased her and promised to be back at nine o'clock; he\r\nkissed her warmly, kissed the baby and ran down quickly to Erkel.\r\n\r\nThey set off together to Stavrogin's park at Skvoreshniki, where, in a\r\nsecluded place at the very edge of the park where it adjoined the pine\r\nwood, he had, eighteen months before, buried the printing press which\r\nhad been entrusted to him.","It was a wild and deserted place, quite\r\nhidden and at some distance from the Stavrogins' house. It was two or\r\nperhaps three miles from Filipov's house.\r\n\r\n\"Are we going to walk all the way? I'll take a cab.\"\r\n\r\n\"I particularly beg you not to,\" replied Erkel.\r\n\r\nThey insisted on that. A cabman would be a witness.\r\n\r\n\"Well... bother! I don't care, only to make an end of it.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked very fast.","\"Erkel, you little boy,\" cried Shatov, \"have you ever been happy?\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to be very happy just now,\" observed Erkel with curiosity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. A BUSY NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nDuring that day Virginsky had spent two hours in running round to\r\nsee the members of the quintet and to inform them that Shatov would\r\ncertainly not give information, because his wife had come back and given\r\nbirth to a child, and no one \"who knew anything of human nature\" could\r\nsuppose that Shatov could be a danger at this moment.","But to his\r\ndiscomfiture he found none of them at home except Erkel and Lyamshin.\r\nErkel listened in silence, looking candidly into his eyes, and in answer\r\nto the direct question \"Would he go at six o'clock or not?\" he replied\r\nwith the brightest of smiles that \"of course he would go.\"\r\n\r\nLyamshin was in bed, seriously ill, as it seemed, with his head covered\r\nwith a quilt. He was alarmed at Virginsky's coming in, and as soon as\r\nthe latter began speaking he waved him off from under the bedclothes,\r\nentreating him to let him alone.","He listened to all he said about\r\nShatov, however, and seemed for some reason extremely struck by the news\r\nthat Virginsky had found no one at home. It seemed that Lyamshin\r\nknew already (through Liputin) of Fedka's death, and hurriedly and\r\nincoherently told Virginsky about it, at which the latter seemed struck\r\nin his turn. To Virginsky's direct question, \"Should they go or not?\" he\r\nbegan suddenly waving his hands again, entreating him to let him alone,\r\nand saying that it was not his business, and that he knew nothing about\r\nit.","Virginsky returned home dejected and greatly alarmed. It weighed upon\r\nhim that he had to hide it from his family; he was accustomed to tell\r\nhis wife everything; and if his feverish brain had not hatched a new\r\nidea at that moment, a new plan of conciliation for further action, he\r\nmight have taken to his bed like Lyamshin. But this new idea sustained\r\nhim; what's more, he began impatiently awaiting the hour fixed, and set\r\noff for the appointed spot earlier than was necessary.","It was a very\r\ngloomy place at the end of the huge park. I went there afterwards on\r\npurpose to look at it. How sinister it must have looked on that chill\r\nautumn evening! It was at the edge of an old wood belonging to the\r\nCrown. Huge ancient pines stood out as vague sombre blurs in the\r\ndarkness. It was so dark that they could hardly see each other two paces\r\noff, but Pyotr Stepanovitch, Liputin, and afterwards Erkel, brought\r\nlanterns with them.","At some unrecorded date in the past a rather\r\nabsurd-looking grotto had for some reason been built here of rough\r\nunhewn stones. The table and benches in the grotto had long ago decayed\r\nand fallen. Two hundred paces to the right was the bank of the third\r\npond of the park. These three ponds stretched one after another for\r\na mile from the house to the very end of the park. One could scarcely\r\nimagine that any noise, a scream, or even a shot, could reach the\r\ninhabitants of the Stavrogins' deserted house.","Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch's\r\ndeparture the previous day and Alexey Yegorytch's absence left only five\r\nor six people in the house, all more or less invalided, so to speak. In\r\nany case it might be assumed with perfect confidence that if cries or\r\nshouts for help were heard by any of the inhabitants of the isolated\r\nhouse they would only have excited terror; no one would have moved from\r\nhis warm stove or snug shelf to give assistance.","By twenty past six almost all of them except Erkel, who had been told\r\noff to fetch Shatov, had turned up at the trysting-place. This time\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch was not late; he came with Tolkatchenko. Tolkatchenko\r\nlooked frowning and anxious; all his assumed determination and insolent\r\nbravado had vanished. He scarcely left Pyotr Stepanovitch's side, and\r\nseemed to have become all at once immensely devoted to him.","He was\r\ncontinually thrusting himself forward to whisper fussily to him, but the\r\nlatter scarcely answered him, or muttered something irritably to get rid\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nShigalov and Virginsky had arrived rather before Pyotr Stepanovitch, and\r\nas soon as he came they drew a little apart in profound and obviously\r\nintentional silence. Pyotr Stepanovitch raised his lantern and examined\r\nthem with unceremonious and insulting minuteness.","\"They mean to speak,\"\r\nflashed through his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't Lyamshin here?\" he asked Virginsky. \"Who said he was ill?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am here,\" responded Lyamshin, suddenly coming from behind a tree.\r\nHe was in a warm greatcoat and thickly muffled in a rug, so that it was\r\ndifficult to make out his face even with a lantern.\r\n\r\n\"So Liputin is the only one not here?\"\r\n\r\nLiputin too came out of the grotto without speaking.","Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\nraised the lantern again.\r\n\r\n\"Why were you hiding in there? Why didn't you come out?\"\r\n\r\n\"I imagine we still keep the right of freedom... of our actions,\"\r\nLiputin muttered, though probably he hardly knew what he wanted to\r\nexpress.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, raising his voice for the first\r\ntime above a whisper, which produced an effect, \"I think you fully\r\nunderstand that it's useless to go over things again.","Everything\r\nwas said and fully thrashed out yesterday, openly and directly.\r\nBut perhaps--as I see from your faces--someone wants to make some\r\nstatement; in that case I beg you to make haste. Damn it all! there's\r\nnot much time, and Erkel may bring him in a minute....\"\r\n\r\n\"He is sure to bring him,\" Tolkatchenko put in for some reason.\r\n\r\n\"If I am not mistaken, the printing press will be handed over, to begin\r\nwith?\" inquired Liputin, though again he seemed hardly to understand why\r\nhe asked the question.","\"Of course. Why should we lose it?\" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, lifting the\r\nlantern to his face. \"But, you see, we all agreed yesterday that it was\r\nnot really necessary to take it. He need only show you the exact spot\r\nwhere it's buried; we can dig it up afterwards for ourselves. I know\r\nthat it's somewhere ten paces from a corner of this grotto. But, damn\r\nit all! how could you have forgotten, Liputin? It was agreed that you\r\nshould meet him alone and that we should come out afterwards.","... It's\r\nstrange that you should ask--or didn't you mean what you said?\"\r\n\r\nLiputin kept gloomily silent. All were silent. The wind shook the tops\r\nof the pine-trees.\r\n\r\n\"I trust, however, gentlemen, that every one will do his duty,\" Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch rapped out impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"I know that Shatov's wife has come back and has given birth to a\r\nchild,\" Virginsky said suddenly, excited and gesticulating and scarcely\r\nable to speak distinctly.","\"Knowing what human nature is, we can be sure\r\nthat now he won't give information... because he is happy.... So I\r\nwent to every one this morning and found no one at home, so perhaps now\r\nnothing need be done....\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped short with a catch in his breath.\r\n\r\n\"If you suddenly became happy, Mr. Virginsky,\" said Pyotr Stepanovitch,\r\nstepping up to him, \"would you abandon--not giving information; there's\r\nno question of that--but any perilous public action which you had\r\nplanned before you were happy and which you regarded as a duty and\r\nobligation in spite of the risk and loss of happiness?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I wouldn't abandon it! I wouldn't on any account!\" said Virginsky\r\nwith absurd warmth, twitching all over.","\"You would rather be unhappy again than be a scoundrel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes.... Quite the contrary.... I'd rather be a complete\r\nscoundrel... that is no... not a scoundrel at all, but on the contrary\r\ncompletely unhappy rather than a scoundrel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then, let me tell you that Shatov looks on this betrayal as a\r\npublic duty. It's his most cherished conviction, and the proof of it is\r\nthat he runs some risk himself; though, of course, they will pardon him\r\na great deal for giving information.","A man like that will never give up\r\nthe idea. No sort of happiness would overcome him. In another day he'll\r\ngo back on it, reproach himself, and will go straight to the police.\r\nWhat's more, I don't see any happiness in the fact that his wife\r\nhas come back after three years' absence to bear him a child of\r\nStavrogin's.\"\r\n\r\n\"But no one has seen Shatov's letter,\" Shigalov brought out all at once,\r\nemphatically.","\"I've seen it,\" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch. \"It exists, and all this is\r\nawfully stupid, gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I protest...\" Virginsky cried, boiling over suddenly: \"I protest\r\nwith all my might.... I want... this is what I want. I suggest that when\r\nhe arrives we all come out and question him, and if it's true, we induce\r\nhim to repent of it; and if he gives us his word of honour, let him\r\ngo. In any case we must have a trial; it must be done after trial.","We\r\nmustn't lie in wait for him and then fall upon him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Risk the cause on his word of honour--that's the acme of stupidity!\r\nDamnation, how stupid it all is now, gentlemen! And a pretty part you\r\nare choosing to play at the moment of danger!\"\r\n\r\n\"I protest, I protest!\" Virginsky persisted.\r\n\r\n\"Don't bawl, anyway; we shan't hear the signal. Shatov, gentlemen....\r\n(Damnation, how stupid this is now!) I've told you already that Shatov\r\nis a Slavophil, that is, one of the stupidest set of people.","... But,\r\ndamn it all, never mind, that's no matter! You put me out!... Shatov is\r\nan embittered man, gentlemen, and since he has belonged to the party,\r\nanyway, whether he wanted to or no, I had hoped till the last minute\r\nthat he might have been of service to the cause and might have been\r\nmade use of as an embittered man. I spared him and was keeping him\r\nin reserve, in spite of most exact instructions.","... I've spared him a\r\nhundred times more than he deserved! But he's ended by betraying\r\nus.... But, hang it all, I don't care! You'd better try running away\r\nnow, any of you! No one of you has the right to give up the job! You can\r\nkiss him if you like, but you haven't the right to stake the cause on\r\nhis word of honour! That's acting like swine and spies in government\r\npay!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's a spy in government pay here?\" Liputin filtered out.","\"You, perhaps. You'd better hold your tongue, Liputin; you talk for the\r\nsake of talking, as you always do. All men are spies, gentlemen, who\r\nfunk their duty at the moment of danger. There will always be some fools\r\nwho'll run in a panic at the last moment and cry out, 'Aie, forgive\r\nme, and I'll give them all away!' But let me tell you, gentlemen,\r\nno betrayal would win you a pardon now. Even if your sentence were\r\nmitigated it would mean Siberia; and, what's more, there's no escaping\r\nthe weapons of the other side--and their weapons are sharper than the\r\ngovernment's.","\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch was furious and said more than he meant to. With a\r\nresolute air Shigalov took three steps towards him. \"Since yesterday\r\nevening I've thought over the question,\" he began, speaking with his\r\nusual pedantry and assurance. (I believe that if the earth had given way\r\nunder his feet he would not have raised his voice nor have varied one\r\ntone in his methodical exposition.) \"Thinking the matter over, I've come\r\nto the conclusion that the projected murder is not merely a waste of\r\nprecious time which might be employed in a more suitable and befitting\r\nmanner, but presents, moreover, that deplorable deviation from the\r\nnormal method which has always been most prejudicial to the cause\r\nand has delayed its triumph for scores of years, under the guidance of\r\nshallow thinkers and pre-eminently of men of political instead of purely\r\nsocialistic leanings.","I have come here solely to protest against the\r\nprojected enterprise, for the general edification, intending then\r\nto withdraw at the actual moment, which you, for some reason I don't\r\nunderstand, speak of as a moment of danger to you. I am going--not from\r\nfear of that danger nor from a sentimental feeling for Shatov, whom I\r\nhave no inclination to kiss, but solely because all this business from\r\nbeginning to end is in direct contradiction to my programme.","As for my\r\nbetraying you and my being in the pay of the government, you can set\r\nyour mind completely at rest. I shall not betray you.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned and walked away.\r\n\r\n\"Damn it all, he'll meet them and warn Shatov!\" cried Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch, pulling out his revolver. They heard the click of the\r\ntrigger.\r\n\r\n\"You may be confident,\" said Shigalov, turning once more, \"that if I\r\nmeet Shatov on the way I may bow to him, but I shall not warn him.","\"\r\n\r\n\"But do you know, you may have to pay for this, Mr. Fourier?\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg you to observe that I am not Fourier. If you mix me up with that\r\nmawkish theoretical twaddler you simply prove that you know nothing of\r\nmy manuscript, though it has been in your hands. As for your vengeance,\r\nlet me tell you that it's a mistake to cock your pistol: that's\r\nabsolutely against your interests at the present moment.","But if you\r\nthreaten to shoot me to-morrow, or the day after, you'll gain nothing by\r\nit but unnecessary trouble. You may kill me, but sooner or later you'll\r\ncome to my system all the same. Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nAt that instant a whistle was heard in the park, two hundred paces away\r\nfrom the direction of the pond. Liputin at once answered, whistling also\r\nas had been agreed the evening before. (As he had lost several teeth and\r\ndistrusted his own powers, he had this morning bought for a farthing\r\nin the market a child's clay whistle for the purpose.",") Erkel had warned\r\nShatov on the way that they would whistle as a signal, so that the\r\nlatter felt no uneasiness.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be uneasy, I'll avoid them and they won't notice me at all,\"\r\nShigalov declared in an impressive whisper; and thereupon deliberately\r\nand without haste he walked home through the dark park.\r\n\r\nEverything, to the smallest detail of this terrible affair, is now fully\r\nknown. To begin with, Liputin met Erkel and Shatov at the entrance\r\nto the grotto.","Shatov did not bow or offer him his hand, but at once\r\npronounced hurriedly in a loud voice:\r\n\r\n\"Well, where have you put the spade, and haven't you another lantern?\r\nYou needn't be afraid, there's absolutely no one here, and they wouldn't\r\nhear at Skvoreshniki now if we fired a cannon here. This is the place,\r\nhere this very spot.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he stamped with his foot ten paces from the end of the grotto\r\ntowards the wood.","At that moment Tolkatchenko rushed out from behind\r\na tree and sprang at him from behind, while Erkel seized him by the\r\nelbows. Liputin attacked him from the front. The three of them at once\r\nknocked him down and pinned him to the ground. At this point Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch darted up with his revolver. It is said that Shatov had\r\ntime to turn his head and was able to see and recognise him. Three\r\nlanterns lighted up the scene.","Shatov suddenly uttered a short and\r\ndesperate scream. But they did not let him go on screaming. Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch firmly and accurately put his revolver to Shatov's\r\nforehead, pressed it to it, and pulled the trigger. The shot seems not\r\nto have been loud; nothing was heard at Skvoreshniki, anyway. Shigalov,\r\nwho was scarcely three paces away, of course heard it--he heard the\r\nshout and the shot, but, as he testified afterwards, he did not turn nor\r\neven stop.","Death was almost instantaneous. Pyotr Stepanovitch was the\r\nonly one who preserved all his faculties, but I don't think he was quite\r\ncool. Squatting on his heels, he searched the murdered man's pockets\r\nhastily, though with steady hand. No money was found (his purse had been\r\nleft under Marya Ignatyevna's pillow). Two or three scraps of paper\r\nof no importance were found: a note from his office, the title of some\r\nbook, and an old bill from a restaurant abroad which had been preserved,\r\ngoodness knows why, for two years in his pocket.","Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\ntransferred these scraps of paper to his own pocket, and suddenly\r\nnoticing that they had all gathered round, were gazing at the corpse and\r\ndoing nothing, he began rudely and angrily abusing them and urging them\r\non. Tolkatchenko and Erkel recovered themselves, and running to the\r\ngrotto brought instantly from it two stones which they had got ready\r\nthere that morning. These stones, which weighed about twenty pounds\r\neach, were securely tied with cord.","As they intended to throw the body\r\nin the nearest of the three ponds, they proceeded to tie the stones to\r\nthe head and feet respectively. Pyotr Stepanovitch fastened the stones\r\nwhile Tolkatchenko and Erkel only held and passed them. Erkel was\r\nforemost, and while Pyotr Stepanovitch, grumbling and swearing, tied the\r\ndead man's feet together with the cord and fastened the stone to them--a\r\nrather lengthy operation--Tolkatchenko stood holding the other stone\r\nat arm's-length, his whole person bending forward, as it were,\r\ndeferentially, to be in readiness to hand it without delay.","It never\r\nonce occurred to him to lay his burden on the ground in the interval.\r\nWhen at last both stones were tied on and Pyotr Stepanovitch got up from\r\nthe ground to scrutinise the faces of his companions, something strange\r\nhappened, utterly unexpected and surprising to almost every one.\r\n\r\nAs I have said already, all except perhaps Tolkatchenko and Erkel were\r\nstanding still doing nothing. Though Virginsky had rushed up to Shatov\r\nwith the others he had not seized him or helped to hold him.","Lyamshin\r\nhad joined the group after the shot had been fired. Afterwards,\r\nwhile Pyotr Stepanovitch was busy with the corpse--for perhaps ten\r\nminutes--none of them seemed to have been fully conscious. They grouped\r\nthemselves around and seemed to have felt amazement rather than anxiety\r\nor alarm. Liputin stood foremost, close to the corpse. Virginsky stood\r\nbehind him, peeping over his shoulder with a peculiar, as it were\r\nunconcerned, curiosity; he even stood on tiptoe to get a better view.","Lyamshin hid behind Virginsky. He took an apprehensive peep from time to\r\ntime and slipped behind him again at once. When the stones had been tied\r\non and Pyotr Stepanovitch had risen to his feet, Virginsky began faintly\r\nshuddering all over, clasped his hands, and cried out bitterly at the\r\ntop of his voice:\r\n\r\n\"It's not the right thing, it's not, it's not at all!\" He would perhaps\r\nhave added something more to his belated exclamation, but Lyamshin did\r\nnot let him finish: he suddenly seized him from behind and squeezed him\r\nwith all his might, uttering an unnatural shriek.","There are moments of\r\nviolent emotion, of terror, for instance, when a man will cry out in a\r\nvoice not his own, unlike anything one could have anticipated from him,\r\nand this has sometimes a very terrible effect. Lyamshin gave vent to a\r\nscream more animal than human. Squeezing Virginsky from behind more and\r\nmore tightly and convulsively, he went on shrieking without a pause,\r\nhis mouth wide open and his eyes starting out of his head, keeping up\r\na continual patter with his feet, as though he were beating a drum.","Virginsky was so scared that he too screamed out like a madman, and\r\nwith a ferocity, a vindictiveness that one could never have expected of\r\nVirginsky. He tried to pull himself away from Lyamshin, scratching and\r\npunching him as far as he could with his arms behind him. Erkel at last\r\nhelped to pull Lyamshin away. But when, in his terror, Virginsky had\r\nskipped ten paces away from him, Lyamshin, catching sight of Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch, began yelling again and flew at him.","Stumbling over\r\nthe corpse, he fell upon Pyotr Stepanovitch, pressing his head to\r\nthe latter's chest and gripping him so tightly in his arms that Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch, Tolkatchenko, and Liputin could all of them do nothing\r\nat the first moment. Pyotr Stepanovitch shouted, swore, beat him on\r\nthe head with his fists. At last, wrenching himself away, he drew his\r\nrevolver and put it in the open mouth of Lyamshin, who was still yelling\r\nand was by now tightly held by Tolkatchenko, Erkel, and Liputin.","But\r\nLyamshin went on shrieking in spite of the revolver. At last Erkel,\r\ncrushing his silk handkerchief into a ball, deftly thrust it into his\r\nmouth and the shriek ceased. Meantime Tolkatchenko tied his hands with\r\nwhat was left of the rope.\r\n\r\n\"It's very strange,\" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, scrutinising the madman\r\nwith uneasy wonder. He was evidently struck. \"I expected something very\r\ndifferent from him,\" he added thoughtfully.","They left Erkel in charge of him for a time. They had to make haste to\r\nget rid of the corpse: there had been so much noise that someone might\r\nhave heard. Tolkatchenko and Pyotr Stepanovitch took up the lanterns\r\nand lifted the corpse by the head, while Liputin and Virginsky took the\r\nfeet, and so they carried it away. With the two stones it was a heavy\r\nburden, and the distance was more than two hundred paces.","Tolkatchenko\r\nwas the strongest of them. He advised them to keep in step, but no one\r\nanswered him and they all walked anyhow. Pyotr Stepanovitch walked\r\non the right and, bending forward, carried the dead man's head on\r\nhis shoulder while with the left hand he supported the stone. As\r\nTolkatchenko walked more than half the way without thinking of helping\r\nhim with the stone, Pyotr Stepanovitch at last shouted at him with an\r\noath.","It was a single, sudden shout. They all went on carrying the body\r\nin silence, and it was only when they reached the pond that Virginsky,\r\nstooping under his burden and seeming to be exhausted by the weight of\r\nit, cried out again in the same loud and wailing voice:\r\n\r\n\"It's not the right thing, no, no, it's not the right thing!\"\r\n\r\nThe place to which they carried the dead man at the extreme end of the\r\nrather large pond, which was the farthest of the three from the house,\r\nwas one of the most solitary and unfrequented spots in the park,\r\nespecially at this late season of the year.","At that end the pond was\r\novergrown with weeds by the banks. They put down the lantern, swung the\r\ncorpse and threw it into the pond. They heard a muffled and prolonged\r\nsplash. Pyotr Stepanovitch raised the lantern and every one followed his\r\nexample, peering curiously to see the body sink, but nothing could\r\nbe seen: weighted with the two stones, the body sank at once. The big\r\nripples spread over the surface of the water and quickly passed away.","It\r\nwas over.\r\n\r\nVirginsky went off with Erkel, who before giving up Lyamshin to\r\nTolkatchenko brought him to Pyotr Stepanovitch, reporting to the\r\nlatter that Lyamshin had come to his senses, was penitent and begged\r\nforgiveness, and indeed had no recollection of what had happened to him.\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch walked off alone, going round by the farther side of\r\nthe pond, skirting the park. This was the longest way.","To his surprise\r\nLiputin overtook him before he got half-way home.\r\n\r\n\"Pyotr Stepanovitch! Pyotr Stepanovitch! Lyamshin will give\r\ninformation!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he will come to his senses and realise that he will be the first to\r\ngo to Siberia if he did. No one will betray us now. Even you won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No fear! I'll get you all out of the way the minute you attempt to turn\r\ntraitors, and you know that.","But you won't turn traitors. Have you run a\r\nmile and a half to tell me that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pyotr Stepanovitch, Pyotr Stepanovitch, perhaps we shall never meet\r\nagain!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's put that into your head?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only tell me one thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what? Though I want you to take yourself off.\"\r\n\r\n\"One question, but answer it truly: are we the only quintet in the\r\nworld, or is it true that there are hundreds of others? It's a question\r\nof the utmost importance to me, Pyotr Stepanovitch.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I see that from the frantic state you are in. But do you know, Liputin,\r\nyou are more dangerous than Lyamshin?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, I know; but the answer, your answer!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a stupid fellow! I should have thought it could make no\r\ndifference to you now whether it's the only quintet or one of a\r\nthousand.\"\r\n\r\n\"That means it's the only one! I was sure of it...\" cried Liputin.\r\n\"I always knew it was the only one, I knew it all along.","\" And without\r\nwaiting for any reply he turned and quickly vanished into the darkness.\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch pondered a little.\r\n\r\n\"No, no one will turn traitor,\" he concluded with decision, \"but the\r\ngroup must remain a group and obey, or I'll... What a wretched set they\r\nare though!\"\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHe first went home, and carefully, without haste, packed his trunk. At\r\nsix o'clock in the morning there was a special train from the town.","This early morning express only ran once a week, and was only a recent\r\nexperiment. Though Pyotr Stepanovitch had told the members of the\r\nquintet that he was only going to be away for a short time in the\r\nneighbourhood, his intentions, as appeared later, were in reality\r\nvery different. Having finished packing, he settled accounts with his\r\nlandlady to whom he had previously given notice of his departure, and\r\ndrove in a cab to Erkel's lodgings, near the station.","And then just upon\r\none o'clock at night he walked to Kirillov's, approaching as before by\r\nFedka's secret way.\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch was in a painful state of mind. Apart from other\r\nextremely grave reasons for dissatisfaction (he was still unable to\r\nlearn anything of Stavrogin), he had, it seems--for I cannot assert\r\nit for a fact--received in the course of that day, probably from\r\nPetersburg, secret information of a danger awaiting him in the immediate\r\nfuture.","There are, of course, many legends in the town relating to this\r\nperiod; but if any facts were known, it was only to those immediately\r\nconcerned. I can only surmise as my own conjecture that Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch may well have had affairs going on in other neighbourhoods\r\nas well as in our town, so that he really may have received such a\r\nwarning. I am convinced, indeed, in spite of Liputin's cynical and\r\ndespairing doubts, that he really had two or three other quintets;\r\nfor instance, in Petersburg and Moscow, and if not quintets at least\r\ncolleagues and correspondents, and possibly was in very curious\r\nrelations with them.","Not more than three days after his departure an\r\norder for his immediate arrest arrived from Petersburg--whether in\r\nconnection with what had happened among us, or elsewhere, I don't know.\r\nThis order only served to increase the overwhelming, almost panic terror\r\nwhich suddenly came upon our local authorities and the society of\r\nthe town, till then so persistently frivolous in its attitude, on\r\nthe discovery of the mysterious and portentous murder of the student\r\nShatov--the climax of the long series of senseless actions in\r\nour midst--as well as the extremely mysterious circumstances that\r\naccompanied that murder.","But the order came too late: Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\nwas already in Petersburg, living under another name, and, learning\r\nwhat was going on, he made haste to make his escape abroad.... But I am\r\nanticipating in a shocking way.\r\n\r\nHe went in to Kirillov, looking ill-humoured and quarrelsome. Apart from\r\nthe real task before him, he felt, as it were, tempted to satisfy some\r\npersonal grudge, to avenge himself on Kirillov for something.","Kirillov\r\nseemed pleased to see him; he had evidently been expecting him a long\r\ntime with painful impatience. His face was paler than usual; there was a\r\nfixed and heavy look in his black eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you weren't coming,\" he brought out drearily from his corner\r\nof the sofa, from which he had not, however, moved to greet him.\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch stood before him and, before uttering a word, looked\r\nintently at his face.","\"Everything is in order, then, and we are not drawing back from our\r\nresolution. Bravo!\" He smiled an offensively patronising smile. \"But,\r\nafter all,\" he added with unpleasant jocosity, \"if I am behind my time,\r\nit's not for you to complain: I made you a present of three hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want extra hours as a present from you, and you can't make me a\r\npresent... you fool!\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" Pyotr Stepanovitch was startled, but instantly controlled\r\nhimself.","\"What huffiness! So we are in a savage temper?\" he rapped\r\nout, still with the same offensive superciliousness. \"At such a moment\r\ncomposure is what you need. The best thing you can do is to consider\r\nyourself a Columbus and me a mouse, and not to take offence at anything\r\nI say. I gave you that advice yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to look upon you as a mouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that, a compliment? But the tea is cold--and that shows that\r\neverything is topsy-turvy.","Bah! But I see something in the window, on a\r\nplate.\" He went to the window. \"Oh oh, boiled chicken and rice!... But\r\nwhy haven't you begun upon it yet? So we are in such a state of mind\r\nthat even chicken...\"\r\n\r\n\"I've dined, and it's not your business. Hold your tongue!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, of course; besides, it's no consequence--though for me at the\r\nmoment it is of consequence. Only fancy, I scarcely had any dinner, and\r\nso if, as I suppose, that chicken is not wanted now.",".. eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eat it if you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, and then I'll have tea.\"\r\n\r\nHe instantly settled himself at the other end of the sofa and fell upon\r\nthe chicken with extraordinary greediness; at the same time he kept a\r\nconstant watch on his victim. Kirillov looked at him fixedly with angry\r\naversion, as though unable to tear himself away.\r\n\r\n\"I say, though,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch fired off suddenly, while he still\r\nwent on eating, \"what about our business? We are not crying off, are we?\r\nHow about that document?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've decided in the night that it's nothing to me.","I'll write it. About\r\nthe manifestoes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, about the manifestoes too. But I'll dictate it. Of course, that's\r\nnothing to you. Can you possibly mind what's in the letter at such a\r\nmoment?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not your business.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not mine, of course. It need only be a few lines, though: that you\r\nand Shatov distributed the manifestoes and with the help of Fedka, who\r\nhid in your lodgings. This last point about Fedka and your lodgings is\r\nvery important--the most important of all, indeed.","You see, I am talking\r\nto you quite openly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shatov? Why Shatov? I won't mention Shatov for anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"What next! What is it to you? You can't hurt him now.\"\r\n\r\n\"His wife has come back to him. She has waked up and has sent to ask me\r\nwhere he is.\"\r\n\r\n\"She has sent to ask you where he is? H'm... that's unfortunate. She may\r\nsend again; no one ought to know I am here.\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch was uneasy.","\"She won't know, she's gone to sleep again. There's a midwife with her,\r\nArina Virginsky.\"\r\n\r\n\"So that's how it was.... She won't overhear, I suppose? I say, you'd\r\nbetter shut the front door.\"\r\n\r\n\"She won't overhear anything. And if Shatov comes I'll hide you in\r\nanother room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shatov won't come; and you must write that you quarrelled with him\r\nbecause he turned traitor and informed the police.",".. this evening...\r\nand caused his death.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is dead!\" cried Kirillov, jumping up from the sofa.\r\n\r\n\"He died at seven o'clock this evening, or rather, at seven o'clock\r\nyesterday evening, and now it's one o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have killed him!... And I foresaw it yesterday!\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt you did! With this revolver here.\" (He drew out his revolver\r\nas though to show it, but did not put it back again and still held it in\r\nhis right hand as though in readiness.",") \"You are a strange man, though,\r\nKirillov; you knew yourself that the stupid fellow was bound to end\r\nlike this. What was there to foresee in that? I made that as plain as\r\npossible over and over again. Shatov was meaning to betray us; I was\r\nwatching him, and it could not be left like that. And you too had\r\ninstructions to watch him; you told me so yourself three weeks ago....\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue! You've done this because he spat in your face in\r\nGeneva!\"\r\n\r\n\"For that and for other things too--for many other things; not from\r\nspite, however.","Why do you jump up? Why look like that? Oh oh, so that's\r\nit, is it?\"\r\n\r\nHe jumped up and held out his revolver before him. Kirillov had suddenly\r\nsnatched up from the window his revolver, which had been loaded and put\r\nready since the morning. Pyotr Stepanovitch took up his position and\r\naimed his weapon at Kirillov. The latter laughed angrily.\r\n\r\n\"Confess, you scoundrel, that you brought your revolver because I might\r\nshoot you.","... But I shan't shoot you... though... though...\"\r\n\r\nAnd again he turned his revolver upon Pyotr Stepanovitch, as it were\r\nrehearsing, as though unable to deny himself the pleasure of imagining\r\nhow he would shoot him. Pyotr Stepanovitch, holding his ground, waited\r\nfor him, waited for him till the last minute without pulling the\r\ntrigger, at the risk of being the first to get a bullet in his head: it\r\nmight well be expected of \"the maniac.","\" But at last \"the maniac\" dropped\r\nhis hand, gasping and trembling and unable to speak.\r\n\r\n\"You've played your little game and that's enough.\" Pyotr Stepanovitch,\r\ntoo, dropped his weapon. \"I knew it was only a game; only you ran a\r\nrisk, let me tell you: I might have fired.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he sat down on the sofa with a fair show of composure and poured\r\nhimself out some tea, though his hand trembled a little.","Kirillov laid\r\nhis revolver on the table and began walking up and down.\r\n\r\n\"I won't write that I killed Shatov... and I won't write anything now.\r\nYou won't have a document!\"\r\n\r\n\"I shan't?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"What meanness and what stupidity!\" Pyotr Stepanovitch turned green with\r\nresentment. \"I foresaw it, though. You've not taken me by surprise, let\r\nme tell you. As you please, however. If I could make you do it by force,\r\nI would.","You are a scoundrel, though.\" Pyotr Stepanovitch was more and\r\nmore carried away and unable to restrain himself. \"You asked us for\r\nmoney out there and promised us no end of things.... I won't go away\r\nwith nothing, however: I'll see you put the bullet through your brains\r\nfirst, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to go away at once.\" Kirillov stood firmly before him.\r\n\r\n\"No, that's impossible.\" Pyotr Stepanovitch took up his revolver again.","\"Now in your spite and cowardice you may think fit to put it off and to\r\nturn traitor to-morrow, so as to get money again; they'll pay you for\r\nthat, of course. Damn it all, fellows like you are capable of anything!\r\nOnly don't trouble yourself; I've provided for all contingencies: I am\r\nnot going till I've dashed your brains out with this revolver, as I did\r\nto that scoundrel Shatov, if you are afraid to do it yourself and put\r\noff your intention, damn you!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are set on seeing my blood, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not acting from spite; let me tell you, it's nothing to me.","I am\r\ndoing it to be at ease about the cause. One can't rely on men; you see\r\nthat for yourself. I don't understand what fancy possesses you to put\r\nyourself to death. It wasn't my idea; you thought of it yourself before\r\nI appeared, and talked of your intention to the committee abroad before\r\nyou said anything to me. And you know, no one has forced it out of you;\r\nno one of them knew you, but you came to confide in them yourself, from\r\nsentimentalism.","And what's to be done if a plan of action here, which\r\ncan't be altered now, was founded upon that with your consent and upon\r\nyour suggestion?... your suggestion, mind that! You have put yourself\r\nin a position in which you know too much. If you are an ass and go off\r\nto-morrow to inform the police, that would be rather a disadvantage to\r\nus; what do you think about it? Yes, you've bound yourself; you've given\r\nyour word, you've taken money.","That you can't deny....\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch was much excited, but for some time past Kirillov\r\nhad not been listening. He paced up and down the room, lost in thought\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry for Shatov,\" he said, stopping before Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Why so? I am sorry, if that's all, and do you suppose...\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue, you scoundrel,\" roared Kirillov, making an alarming\r\nand unmistakable movement; \"I'll kill you.","\"\r\n\r\n\"There, there, there! I told a lie, I admit it; I am not sorry at all.\r\nCome, that's enough, that's enough.\" Pyotr Stepanovitch started up\r\napprehensively, putting out his hand.\r\n\r\nKirillov subsided and began walking up and down again.\r\n\r\n\"I won't put it off; I want to kill myself now: all are scoundrels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's an idea; of course all are scoundrels; and since life is a\r\nbeastly thing for a decent man.","..\"\r\n\r\n\"Fool, I am just such a scoundrel as you, as all, not a decent man.\r\nThere's never been a decent man anywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's guessed the truth at last! Can you, Kirillov, with your sense,\r\nhave failed to see till now that all men are alike, that there are none\r\nbetter or worse, only some are stupider, than others, and that if all\r\nare scoundrels (which is nonsense, though) there oughtn't to be any\r\npeople that are not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Why, you are really in earnest?\" Kirillov looked at him with some\r\nwonder.","\"You speak with heat and simply.... Can it be that even fellows\r\nlike you have convictions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kirillov, I've never been able to understand why you mean to kill\r\nyourself. I only know it's from conviction... strong conviction. But\r\nif you feel a yearning to express yourself, so to say, I am at your\r\nservice.... Only you must think of the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"What time is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh oh, just two.\" Pyotr Stepanovitch looked at his watch and lighted a\r\ncigarette.","\"It seems we can come to terms after all,\" he reflected.\r\n\r\n\"I've nothing to say to you,\" muttered Kirillov.\r\n\r\n\"I remember that something about God comes into it... you explained it\r\nto me once--twice, in fact. If you stopped yourself, you become God;\r\nthat's it, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I become God.\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch did not even smile; he waited. Kirillov looked at him\r\nsubtly.\r\n\r\n\"You are a political impostor and intriguer.","You want to lead me on into\r\nphilosophy and enthusiasm and to bring about a reconciliation so as to\r\ndisperse my anger, and then, when I am reconciled with you, beg from me\r\na note to say I killed Shatov.\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch answered with almost natural frankness.\r\n\r\n\"Well, supposing I am such a scoundrel. But at the last moments does\r\nthat matter to you, Kirillov? What are we quarrelling about? Tell me,\r\nplease.","You are one sort of man and I am another--what of it? And what's\r\nmore, we are both of us...\"\r\n\r\n\"Scoundrels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, scoundrels if you like. But you know that that's only words.\"\r\n\r\n\"All my life I wanted it not to be only words. I lived because I did not\r\nwant it to be. Even now every day I want it to be not words.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, every one seeks to be where he is best off. The fish... that is,\r\nevery one seeks his own comfort, that's all.","That's been a commonplace\r\nfor ages and ages.\"\r\n\r\n\"Comfort, do you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's not worth while quarrelling over words.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you were right in what you said; let it be comfort. God is\r\nnecessary and so must exist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's all right, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I know He doesn't and can't.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's more likely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely you must understand that a man with two such ideas can't go on\r\nliving?\"\r\n\r\n\"Must shoot himself, you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely you must understand that one might shoot oneself for that\r\nalone? You don't understand that there may be a man, one man out of your\r\nthousands of millions, one man who won't bear it and does not want to.","\"\r\n\r\n\"All I understand is that you seem to be hesitating.... That's very\r\nbad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stavrogin, too, is consumed by an idea,\" Kirillov said gloomily, pacing\r\nup and down the room. He had not noticed the previous remark.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" Pyotr Stepanovitch pricked up his ears. \"What idea? Did he tell\r\nyou something himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I guessed it myself: if Stavrogin has faith, he does not believe\r\nthat he has faith.","If he hasn't faith, he does not believe that he\r\nhasn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Stavrogin has got something else worse than that in his head,\"\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch muttered peevishly, uneasily watching the turn the\r\nconversation had taken and the pallor of Kirillov.\r\n\r\n\"Damn it all, he won't shoot himself!\" he was thinking. \"I always\r\nsuspected it; it's a maggot in the brain and nothing more; what a rotten\r\nlot of people!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are the last to be with me; I shouldn't like to part on bad terms\r\nwith you,\" Kirillov vouchsafed suddenly.","Pyotr Stepanovitch did not answer at once. \"Damn it all, what is it\r\nnow?\" he thought again.\r\n\r\n\"I assure you, Kirillov, I have nothing against you personally as a man,\r\nand always...\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a scoundrel and a false intellect. But I am just the same as\r\nyou are, and I will shoot myself while you will remain living.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean to say, I am so abject that I want to go on living.\"\r\n\r\nHe could not make up his mind whether it was judicious to keep up such\r\na conversation at such a moment or not, and resolved \"to be guided by\r\ncircumstances.","\" But the tone of superiority and of contempt for him,\r\nwhich Kirillov had never disguised, had always irritated him, and\r\nnow for some reason it irritated him more than ever--possibly because\r\nKirillov, who was to die within an hour or so (Pyotr Stepanovitch still\r\nreckoned upon this), seemed to him, as it were, already only half a man,\r\nsome creature whom he could not allow to be haughty.\r\n\r\n\"You seem to be boasting to me of your shooting yourself.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I've always been surprised at every one's going on living,\" said\r\nKirillov, not hearing his remark.\r\n\r\n\"H'm! Admitting that's an idea, but...\"\r\n\r\n\"You ape, you assent to get the better of me. Hold your tongue; you\r\nwon't understand anything. If there is no God, then I am God.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, I could never understand that point of yours: why are you God?\"\r\n\r\n\"If God exists, all is His will and from His will I cannot escape.","If\r\nnot, it's all my will and I am bound to show self-will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Self-will? But why are you bound?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because all will has become mine. Can it be that no one in the whole\r\nplanet, after making an end of God and believing in his own will, will\r\ndare to express his self-will on the most vital point? It's like a\r\nbeggar inheriting a fortune and being afraid of it and not daring to\r\napproach the bag of gold, thinking himself too weak to own it.","I want to\r\nmanifest my self-will. I may be the only one, but I'll do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do it by all means.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am bound to shoot myself because the highest point of my self-will is\r\nto kill myself with my own hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you won't be the only one to kill yourself; there are lots of\r\nsuicides.\"\r\n\r\n\"With good cause. But to do it without any cause at all, simply for\r\nself-will, I am the only one.\"\r\n\r\n\"He won't shoot himself,\" flashed across Pyotr Stepanovitch's mind\r\nagain.","\"Do you know,\" he observed irritably, \"if I were in your place I should\r\nkill someone else to show my self-will, not myself. You might be of\r\nuse. I'll tell you whom, if you are not afraid. Then you needn't shoot\r\nyourself to-day, perhaps. We may come to terms.\"\r\n\r\n\"To kill someone would be the lowest point of self-will, and you show\r\nyour whole soul in that. I am not you: I want the highest point and I'll\r\nkill myself.","\"\r\n\r\n\"He's come to it of himself,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch muttered malignantly.\r\n\r\n\"I am bound to show my unbelief,\" said Kirillov, walking about the room.\r\n\"I have no higher idea than disbelief in God. I have all the history of\r\nmankind on my side. Man has done nothing but invent God so as to go on\r\nliving, and not kill himself; that's the whole of universal history up\r\ntill now. I am the first one in the whole history of mankind who would\r\nnot invent God.","Let them know it once for all.\"\r\n\r\n\"He won't shoot himself,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch thought anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Let whom know it?\" he said, egging him on. \"It's only you and me here;\r\nyou mean Liputin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let every one know; all will know. There is nothing secret that will\r\nnot be made known. _He_ said so.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he pointed with feverish enthusiasm to the image of the Saviour,\r\nbefore which a lamp was burning.","Pyotr Stepanovitch lost his temper\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\n\"So you still believe in Him, and you've lighted the lamp; 'to be on the\r\nsafe side,' I suppose?\"\r\n\r\nThe other did not speak.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, to my thinking, you believe perhaps more thoroughly than\r\nany priest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Believe in whom? In _Him?_ Listen.\" Kirillov stood still, gazing before\r\nhim with fixed and ecstatic look. \"Listen to a great idea: there was a\r\nday on earth, and in the midst of the earth there stood three crosses.","One on the Cross had such faith that he said to another, 'To-day thou\r\nshalt be with me in Paradise.' The day ended; both died and passed away\r\nand found neither Paradise nor resurrection. His words did not come\r\ntrue. Listen: that Man was the loftiest of all on earth, He was that\r\nwhich gave meaning to life. The whole planet, with everything on it, is\r\nmere madness without that Man. There has never been any like Him before\r\nor since, never, up to a miracle.","For that is the miracle, that there\r\nnever was or never will be another like Him. And if that is so, if\r\nthe laws of nature did not spare even Him, have not spared even their\r\nmiracle and made even Him live in a lie and die for a lie, then all the\r\nplanet is a lie and rests on a lie and on mockery. So then, the very\r\nlaws of the planet are a lie and the vaudeville of devils. What is there\r\nto live for? Answer, if you are a man.","\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a different matter. It seems to me you've mixed up two different\r\ncauses, and that's a very unsafe thing to do. But excuse me, if you are\r\nGod? If the lie were ended and if you realised that all the falsity\r\ncomes from the belief in that former God?\"\r\n\r\n\"So at last you understand!\" cried Kirillov rapturously. \"So it can be\r\nunderstood if even a fellow like you understands. Do you understand now\r\nthat the salvation for all consists in proving this idea to every one?\r\nWho will prove it? I! I can't understand how an atheist could know that\r\nthere is no God and not kill himself on the spot.","To recognise that\r\nthere is no God and not to recognise at the same instant that one is God\r\noneself is an absurdity, else one would certainly kill oneself. If you\r\nrecognise it you are sovereign, and then you won't kill yourself but\r\nwill live in the greatest glory. But one, the first, must kill himself,\r\nfor else who will begin and prove it? So I must certainly kill myself,\r\nto begin and prove it.","Now I am only a god against my will and I am\r\nunhappy, because I am bound to assert my will. All are unhappy because\r\nall are afraid to express their will. Man has hitherto been so unhappy\r\nand so poor because he has been afraid to assert his will in the\r\nhighest point and has shown his self-will only in little things, like a\r\nschoolboy. I am awfully unhappy, for I'm awfully afraid. Terror is the\r\ncurse of man.","... But I will assert my will, I am bound to believe that\r\nI don't believe. I will begin and will make an end of it and open the\r\ndoor, and will save. That's the only thing that will save mankind and\r\nwill re-create the next generation physically; for with his present\r\nphysical nature man can't get on without his former God, I believe. For\r\nthree years I've been seeking for the attribute of my godhead and I've\r\nfound it; the attribute of my godhead is self-will! That's all I can\r\ndo to prove in the highest point my independence and my new terrible\r\nfreedom.","For it is very terrible. I am killing myself to prove my\r\nindependence and my new terrible freedom.\"\r\n\r\nHis face was unnaturally pale, and there was a terribly heavy look in\r\nhis eyes. He was like a man in delirium. Pyotr Stepanovitch thought he\r\nwould drop on to the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Give me the pen!\" Kirillov cried suddenly, quite unexpectedly, in a\r\npositive frenzy. \"Dictate; I'll sign anything. I'll sign that I killed\r\nShatov even.","Dictate while it amuses me. I am not afraid of what the\r\nhaughty slaves will think! You will see for yourself that all that is\r\nsecret shall be made manifest! And you will be crushed.... I believe, I\r\nbelieve!\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch jumped up from his seat and instantly handed him an\r\ninkstand and paper, and began dictating, seizing the moment, quivering\r\nwith anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"I, Alexey Kirillov, declare.","..\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay; I won't! To whom am I declaring it?\"\r\n\r\nKirillov was shaking as though he were in a fever. This declaration and\r\nthe sudden strange idea of it seemed to absorb him entirely, as though\r\nit were a means of escape by which his tortured spirit strove for a\r\nmoment's relief.\r\n\r\n\"To whom am I declaring it? I want to know to whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"To no one, every one, the first person who reads it. Why define it? The\r\nwhole world!\"\r\n\r\n\"The whole world! Bravo! And I won't have any repentance.","I don't want\r\npenitence and I don't want it for the police!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, of course, there's no need of it, damn the police! Write, if you\r\nare in earnest!\" Pyotr Stepanovitch cried hysterically.\r\n\r\n\"Stay! I want to put at the top a face with the tongue out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ech, what nonsense,\" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch crossly, \"you can express\r\nall that without the drawing, by--the tone.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the tone? That's true.","Yes, by the tone, by the tone of it. Dictate,\r\nthe tone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I, Alexey Kirillov,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch dictated firmly and\r\nperemptorily, bending over Kirillov's shoulder and following every\r\nletter which the latter formed with a hand trembling with excitement,\r\n\"I, Kirillov, declare that to-day, the --th October, at about eight\r\no'clock in the evening, I killed the student Shatov in the park for\r\nturning traitor and giving information of the manifestoes and of Fedka,\r\nwho has been lodging with us for ten days in Filipov's house.","I am\r\nshooting myself to-day with my revolver, not because I repent and am\r\nafraid of you, but because when I was abroad I made up my mind to put an\r\nend to my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" cried Kirillov with surprise and indignation.\r\n\r\n\"Not another word,\" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch, waving his hand, attempting\r\nto snatch the document from him.\r\n\r\n\"Stay.\" Kirillov put his hand firmly on the paper. \"Stay, it's nonsense!\r\nI want to say with whom I killed him.","Why Fedka? And what about the\r\nfire? I want it all and I want to be abusive in tone, too, in tone!\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, Kirillov, I assure you it's enough,\" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\nalmost imploringly, trembling lest he should tear up the paper; \"that\r\nthey may believe you, you must say it as obscurely as possible, just\r\nlike that, simply in hints. You must only give them a peep of the truth,\r\njust enough to tantalise them.","They'll tell a story better than ours,\r\nand of course they'll believe themselves more than they would us; and\r\nyou know, it's better than anything--better than anything! Let me have\r\nit, it's splendid as it is; give it to me, give it to me!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he kept trying to snatch the paper. Kirillov listened open-eyed and\r\nappeared to be trying to reflect, but he seemed beyond understanding\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\"Damn it all,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch cried all at once, ill-humouredly, \"he\r\nhasn't signed it! Why are you staring like that? Sign!\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to abuse them,\" muttered Kirillov.","He took the pen, however, and\r\nsigned. \"I want to abuse them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Write _'Vive la r√©publique,'_ and that will be enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo!\" Kirillov almost bellowed with delight. \"_'Vive la r√©publique\r\nd√©mocratique sociale et universelle ou la mort!'_ No, no, that's not it.\r\n_'Libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√© ou la mort.'_ There, that's better, that's\r\nbetter.\" He wrote it gleefully under his signature.\r\n\r\n\"Enough, enough,\" repeated Pyotr Stepanovitch.","\"Stay, a little more. I'll sign it again in French, you know. '_De\r\nKirillov, gentilhomme russe et citoyen du monde._' Ha ha!\" He went off\r\nin a peal of laughter. \"No, no, no; stay. I've found something better\r\nthan all. Eureka! _'Gentilhomme, s√©minariste russe et citoyen du monde\r\ncivilis√©!'_ That's better than any....\" He jumped up from the sofa\r\nand suddenly, with a rapid gesture, snatched up the revolver from the\r\nwindow, ran with it into the next room, and closed the door behind him.","Pyotr Stepanovitch stood for a moment, pondering and gazing at the door.\r\n\r\n\"If he does it at once, perhaps he'll do it, but if he begins thinking,\r\nnothing will come of it.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he took up the paper, sat down, and looked at it again. The\r\nwording of the document pleased him again.\r\n\r\n\"What's needed for the moment? What's wanted is to throw them all off\r\nthe scent and keep them busy for a time.","The park? There's no park in\r\nthe town and they'll guess its Skvoreshniki of themselves. But while\r\nthey are arriving at that, time will be passing; then the search will\r\ntake time too; then when they find the body it will prove that the story\r\nis true, and it will follow that's it all true, that it's true about\r\nFedka too. And Fedka explains the fire, the Lebyadkins; so that it was\r\nall being hatched here, at Filipov's, while they overlooked it and saw\r\nnothing--that will quite turn their heads! They will never think of\r\nthe quintet; Shatov and Kirillov and Fedka and Lebyadkin, and why they\r\nkilled each other--that will be another question for them.","Oh, damn it\r\nall, I don't hear the shot!\"\r\n\r\nThough he had been reading and admiring the wording of it, he had been\r\nlistening anxiously all the time, and he suddenly flew into a rage. He\r\nlooked anxiously at his watch; it was getting late and it was fully ten\r\nminutes since Kirillov had gone out.... Snatching up the candle, he went\r\nto the door of the room where Kirillov had shut himself up. He was just\r\nat the door when the thought struck him that the candle had burnt out,\r\nthat it would not last another twenty minutes, and that there was no\r\nother in the room.","He took hold of the handle and listened warily; he\r\ndid not hear the slightest sound. He suddenly opened the door and lifted\r\nup the candle: something uttered a roar and rushed at him. He slammed\r\nthe door with all his might and pressed his weight against it; but all\r\nsounds died away and again there was deathlike stillness.\r\n\r\nHe stood for a long while irresolute, with the candle in his hand. He\r\nhad been able to see very little in the second he held the door open,\r\nbut he had caught a glimpse of the face of Kirillov standing at the\r\nother end of the room by the window, and the savage fury with which the\r\nlatter had rushed upon him.","Pyotr Stepanovitch started, rapidly set the\r\ncandle on the table, made ready his revolver, and retreated on tiptoe to\r\nthe farthest corner of the room, so that if Kirillov opened the door and\r\nrushed up to the table with the revolver he would still have time to be\r\nthe first to aim and fire.\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch had by now lost all faith in the suicide. \"He was\r\nstanding in the middle of the room, thinking,\" flashed like a whirlwind\r\nthrough Pyotr Stepanovitch's mind, \"and the room was dark and horrible\r\ntoo.","... He roared and rushed at me. There are two possibilities: either\r\nI interrupted him at the very second when he was pulling the trigger\r\nor... or he was standing planning how to kill me. Yes, that's it, he was\r\nplanning it.... He knows I won't go away without killing him if he funks\r\nit himself--so that he would have to kill me first to prevent my killing\r\nhim.... And again, again there is silence.","I am really frightened: he\r\nmay open the door all of a sudden.... The nuisance of it is that he\r\nbelieves in God like any priest.... He won't shoot himself for\r\nanything! There are lots of these people nowadays 'who've come to it of\r\nthemselves.' A rotten lot! Oh, damn it, the candle, the candle! It'll go\r\nout within a quarter of an hour for certain.... I must put a stop to it;\r\ncome what may, I must put a stop to it.","... Now I can kill him.... With\r\nthat document here no one would think of my killing him. I can put him\r\nin such an attitude on the floor with an unloaded revolver in his hand\r\nthat they'd be certain he'd done it himself.... Ach, damn it! how is one\r\nto kill him? If I open the door he'll rush out again and shoot me first.\r\nDamn it all, he'll be sure to miss!\"\r\n\r\nHe was in agonies, trembling at the necessity of action and his own\r\nindecision.","At last he took up the candle and again approached the door\r\nwith the revolver held up in readiness; he put his left hand, in which\r\nhe held the candle, on the doorhandle. But he managed awkwardly:\r\nthe handle clanked, there was a rattle and a creak. \"He will fire\r\nstraightway,\" flashed through Pyotr Stepanovitch's mind. With his foot\r\nhe flung the door open violently, raised the candle, and held out the\r\nrevolver; but no shot nor cry came from within.","... There was no one in\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nHe started. The room led nowhere. There was no exit, no means of\r\nescape from it. He lifted the candle higher and looked about him more\r\nattentively: there was certainly no one. He called Kirillov's name in a\r\nlow voice, then again louder; no one answered.\r\n\r\n\"Can he have got out by the window?\" The casement in one window was, in\r\nfact, open. \"Absurd! He couldn't have got away through the casement.","\"\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch crossed the room and went up to the window. \"He\r\ncouldn't possibly.\" All at once he turned round quickly and was aghast\r\nat something extraordinary.\r\n\r\nAgainst the wall facing the windows on the right of the door stood a\r\ncupboard. On the right side of this cupboard, in the corner formed by\r\nthe cupboard and the wall, stood Kirillov, and he was standing in a very\r\nstrange way; motionless, perfectly erect, with his arms held stiffly at\r\nhis sides, his head raised and pressed tightly back against the wall in\r\nthe very corner, he seemed to be trying to conceal and efface himself.","Everything seemed to show that he was hiding, yet somehow it was not\r\neasy to believe it. Pyotr Stepanovitch was standing a little sideways\r\nto the corner, and could only see the projecting parts of the figure.\r\nHe could not bring himself to move to the left to get a full view of\r\nKirillov and solve the mystery. His heart began beating violently, and\r\nhe felt a sudden rush of blind fury: he started from where he stood,\r\nand, shouting and stamping with his feet, he rushed to the horrible\r\nplace.","But when he reached Kirillov he stopped short again, still more\r\novercome, horror-stricken. What struck him most was that, in spite of\r\nhis shout and his furious rush, the figure did not stir, did not move\r\nin a single limb--as though it were of stone or of wax. The pallor of\r\nthe face was unnatural, the black eyes were quite unmoving and were\r\nstaring away at a point in the distance. Pyotr Stepanovitch lowered the\r\ncandle and raised it again, lighting up the figure from all points of\r\nview and scrutinising it.","He suddenly noticed that, although Kirillov\r\nwas looking straight before him, he could see him and was perhaps\r\nwatching him out of the corner of his eye. Then the idea occurred to him\r\nto hold the candle right up to the wretch's face, to scorch him and see\r\nwhat he would do. He suddenly fancied that Kirillov's chin twitched and\r\nthat something like a mocking smile passed over his lips--as though\r\nhe had guessed Pyotr Stepanovitch's thought.","He shuddered and, beside\r\nhimself, clutched violently at Kirillov's shoulder.\r\n\r\nThen something happened so hideous and so soon over that Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch could never afterwards recover a coherent impression of\r\nit. He had hardly touched Kirillov when the latter bent down quickly and\r\nwith his head knocked the candle out of Pyotr Stepanovitch's hand; the\r\ncandlestick fell with a clang on the ground and the candle went out.","At\r\nthe same moment he was conscious of a fearful pain in the little finger\r\nof his left hand. He cried out, and all that he could remember was that,\r\nbeside himself, he hit out with all his might and struck three blows\r\nwith the revolver on the head of Kirillov, who had bent down to him\r\nand had bitten his finger. At last he tore away his finger and rushed\r\nheadlong to get out of the house, feeling his way in the dark.","He was\r\npursued by terrible shouts from the room.\r\n\r\n\"Directly, directly, directly, directly.\" Ten times. But he still ran\r\non, and was running into the porch when he suddenly heard a loud shot.\r\nThen he stopped short in the dark porch and stood deliberating for five\r\nminutes; at last he made his way back into the house. But he had to\r\nget the candle. He had only to feel on the floor on the right of the\r\ncupboard for the candlestick; but how was he to light the candle? There\r\nsuddenly came into his mind a vague recollection: he recalled that\r\nwhen he had run into the kitchen the day before to attack Fedka he had\r\nnoticed in passing a large red box of matches in a corner on a shelf.","Feeling with his hands, he made his way to the door on the left leading\r\nto the kitchen, found it, crossed the passage, and went down the steps.\r\nOn the shelf, on the very spot where he had just recalled seeing it, he\r\nfelt in the dark a full unopened box of matches. He hurriedly went up\r\nthe steps again without striking a light, and it was only when he was\r\nnear the cupboard, at the spot where he had struck Kirillov with the\r\nrevolver and been bitten by him, that he remembered his bitten finger,\r\nand at the same instant was conscious that it was unbearably painful.","Clenching his teeth, he managed somehow to light the candle-end, set it\r\nin the candlestick again, and looked about him: near the open casement,\r\nwith his feet towards the right-hand corner, lay the dead body of\r\nKirillov. The shot had been fired at the right temple and the bullet\r\nhad come out at the top on the left, shattering the skull. There were\r\nsplashes of blood and brains. The revolver was still in the suicide's\r\nhand on the floor.","Death must have been instantaneous. After a careful\r\nlook round, Pyotr Stepanovitch got up and went out on tiptoe, closed the\r\ndoor, left the candle on the table in the outer room, thought a moment,\r\nand resolved not to put it out, reflecting that it could not possibly\r\nset fire to anything. Looking once more at the document left on the\r\ntable, he smiled mechanically and then went out of the house, still for\r\nsome reason walking on tiptoe.","He crept through Fedka's hole again and\r\ncarefully replaced the posts after him.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nPrecisely at ten minutes to six Pyotr Stepanovitch and Erkel were\r\nwalking up and down the platform at the railway-station beside a rather\r\nlong train. Pyotr Stepanovitch was setting off and Erkel was saying\r\ngood-bye to him. The luggage was in, and his bag was in the seat he had\r\ntaken in a second-class carriage.","The first bell had rung already; they\r\nwere waiting for the second. Pyotr Stepanovitch looked about him, openly\r\nwatching the passengers as they got into the train. But he did not meet\r\nanyone he knew well; only twice he nodded to acquaintances--a merchant\r\nwhom he knew slightly, and then a young village priest who was going\r\nto his parish two stations away. Erkel evidently wanted to speak of\r\nsomething of importance in the last moments, though possibly he did not\r\nhimself know exactly of what, but he could not bring himself to begin!\r\nHe kept fancying that Pyotr Stepanovitch seemed anxious to get rid of\r\nhim and was impatient for the last bell.","\"You look at every one so openly,\" he observed with some timidity, as\r\nthough he would have warned him.\r\n\r\n\"Why not? It would not do for me to conceal myself at present. It's too\r\nsoon. Don't be uneasy. All I am afraid of is that the devil might send\r\nLiputin this way; he might scent me out and race off here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pyotr Stepanovitch, they are not to be trusted,\" Erkel brought out\r\nresolutely.\r\n\r\n\"Liputin?\"\r\n\r\n\"None of them, Pyotr Stepanovitch.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! they are all bound by what happened yesterday. There isn't\r\none who would turn traitor. People won't go to certain destruction\r\nunless they've lost their reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pyotr Stepanovitch, but they will lose their reason.\" Evidently that\r\nidea had already occurred to Pyotr Stepanovitch too, and so Erkel's\r\nobservation irritated him the more.\r\n\r\n\"You are not in a funk too, are you, Erkel? I rely on you more than on\r\nany of them.","I've seen now what each of them is worth. Tell them to-day\r\nall I've told you. I leave them in your charge. Go round to each of them\r\nthis morning. Read them my written instructions to-morrow, or the day\r\nafter, when you are all together and they are capable of listening\r\nagain... and believe me, they will be by to-morrow, for they'll be in an\r\nawful funk, and that will make them as soft as wax...",". The great thing\r\nis that you shouldn't be downhearted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ach, Pyotr Stepanovitch, it would be better if you weren't going away.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am only going for a few days; I shall be back in no time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pyotr Stepanovitch,\" Erkel brought out warily but resolutely, \"what if\r\nyou were going to Petersburg? Of course, I understand that you are only\r\ndoing what's necessary for the cause.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expected as much from you, Erkel.","If you have guessed that I am going\r\nto Petersburg you can realise that I couldn't tell them yesterday, at\r\nthat moment, that I was going so far for fear of frightening them. You\r\nsaw for yourself what a state they were in. But you understand that I\r\nam going for the cause, for work of the first importance, for the common\r\ncause, and not to save my skin, as Liputin imagines.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pyotr Stepanovitch, what if you were going abroad? I should\r\nunderstand.",".. I should understand that you must be careful of yourself\r\nbecause you are everything and we are nothing. I shall understand, Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch.\" The poor boy's voice actually quivered.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Erkel.... Aie, you've touched my bad finger.\" (Erkel had\r\npressed his hand awkwardly; the bad finger was discreetly bound up\r\nin black silk.) \"But I tell you positively again that I am going to\r\nPetersburg only to sniff round, and perhaps shall only be there for\r\ntwenty-four hours and then back here again at once.","When I come back I\r\nshall stay at Gaganov's country place for the sake of appearances. If\r\nthere is any notion of danger, I should be the first to take the lead\r\nand share it. If I stay longer in Petersburg I'll let you know at once\r\n... in the way we've arranged, and you'll tell them.\" The second bell\r\nrang.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, then there's only five minutes before the train starts. I don't\r\nwant the group here to break up, you know.","I am not afraid; don't be\r\nanxious about me. I have plenty of such centres, and it's not much\r\nconsequence; but there's no harm in having as many centres as possible.\r\nBut I am quite at ease about you, though I am leaving you almost alone\r\nwith those idiots. Don't be uneasy; they won't turn traitor, they won't\r\nhave the pluck.... Ha ha, you going to-day too?\" he cried suddenly in a\r\nquite different, cheerful voice to a very young man, who came up gaily\r\nto greet him.","\"I didn't know you were going by the express too. Where\r\nare you off to... your mother's?\"\r\n\r\nThe mother of the young man was a very wealthy landowner in a\r\nneighbouring province, and the young man was a distant relation of Yulia\r\nMihailovna's and had been staying about a fortnight in our town.\r\n\r\n\"No, I am going farther, to R----. I've eight hours to live through in\r\nthe train. Off to Petersburg?\" laughed the young man.","\"What makes you suppose I must be going to Petersburg?\" said Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch, laughing even more openly.\r\n\r\nThe young man shook his gloved finger at him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you've guessed right,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch whispered to him\r\nmysteriously. \"I am going with letters from Yulia Mihailovna and have to\r\ncall on three or four personages, as you can imagine--bother them all,\r\nto speak candidly. It's a beastly job!\"\r\n\r\n\"But why is she in such a panic? Tell me,\" the young man whispered too.","\"She wouldn't see even me yesterday. I don't think she has anything to\r\nfear for her husband, quite the contrary; he fell down so creditably at\r\nthe fire--ready to sacrifice his life, so to speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there it is,\" laughed Pyotr Stepanovitch. \"You see, she is\r\nafraid that people may have written from here already... that is, some\r\ngentlemen.... The fact is, Stavrogin is at the bottom of it, or rather\r\nPrince K.","... Ech, it's a long story; I'll tell you something about it on\r\nthe journey if you like--as far as my chivalrous feelings will allow\r\nme, at least.... This is my relation, Lieutenant Erkel, who lives down\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man, who had been stealthily glancing at Erkel, touched his\r\nhat; Erkel made a bow.\r\n\r\n\"But I say, Verhovensky, eight hours in the train is an awful ordeal.\r\nBerestov, the colonel, an awfully funny fellow, is travelling with me in\r\nthe first class.","He is a neighbour of ours in the country, and his wife\r\nis a Garin (_n√©e_ de Garine), and you know he is a very decent fellow.\r\nHe's got ideas too. He's only been here a couple of days. He's\r\npassionately fond of whist; couldn't we get up a game, eh? I've already\r\nfixed on a fourth--Pripuhlov, our merchant from T----with a beard, a\r\nmillionaire--I mean it, a real millionaire; you can take my word for\r\nit.","... I'll introduce you; he is a very interesting money-bag. We shall\r\nhave a laugh.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be delighted, and I am awfully fond of cards in the train, but\r\nI am going second class.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, that's no matter. Get in with us. I'll tell them directly to\r\nmove you to the first class. The chief guard would do anything I tell\r\nhim. What have you got?... a bag? a rug?\"\r\n\r\n\"First-rate. Come along!\"\r\n\r\nPyotr Stepanovitch took his bag, his rug, and his book, and at once and\r\nwith alacrity transferred himself to the first class.","Erkel helped him.\r\nThe third bell rang.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Erkel.\" Hurriedly, and with a preoccupied air, Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\nheld out his hand from the window for the last time. \"You see, I am\r\nsitting down to cards with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why explain, Pyotr Stepanovitch? I understand, I understand it all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, au revoir,\" Pyotr Stepanovitch turned away suddenly on his\r\nname being called by the young man, who wanted to introduce him to his\r\npartners.","And Erkel saw nothing more of Pyotr Stepanovitch.\r\n\r\nHe returned home very sad. Not that he was alarmed at Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch's leaving them so suddenly, but... he had turned away from\r\nhim so quickly when that young swell had called to him and... he might\r\nhave said something different to him, not \"Au revoir,\" or... or at\r\nleast have pressed his hand more warmly. That last was bitterest of all.\r\nSomething else was beginning to gnaw in his poor little heart, something\r\nwhich he could not understand himself yet, something connected with the\r\nevening before.","CHAPTER VII. STEPAN TROFIMOVITCH'S LAST WANDERING\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nI am persuaded that Stepan Trofimovitch was terribly frightened as\r\nhe felt the time fixed for his insane enterprise drawing near. I am\r\nconvinced that he suffered dreadfully from terror, especially on the\r\nnight before he started--that awful night. Nastasya mentioned afterwards\r\nthat he had gone to bed late and fallen asleep. But that proves nothing;\r\nmen sentenced to death sleep very soundly, they say, even the night\r\nbefore their execution.","Though he set off by daylight, when a nervous\r\nman is always a little more confident (and the major, Virginsky's\r\nrelative, used to give up believing in God every morning when the night\r\nwas over), yet I am convinced he could never, without horror, have\r\nimagined himself alone on the high road in such a position. No doubt\r\na certain desperation in his feelings softened at first the terrible\r\nsensation of sudden solitude in which he at once found himself as soon\r\nas he had left Nastasya, and the corner in which he had been warm and\r\nsnug for twenty years.","But it made no difference; even with the clearest\r\nrecognition of all the horrors awaiting him he would have gone out to\r\nthe high road and walked along it! There was something proud in the\r\nundertaking which allured him in spite of everything. Oh, he might have\r\naccepted Varvara Petrovna's luxurious provision and have remained living\r\non her charity, \"_comme un_ humble dependent.\" But he had not accepted her\r\ncharity and was not remaining! And here he was leaving her of himself,\r\nand holding aloft the \"standard of a great idea, and going to die for it\r\non the open road.","\" That is how he must have been feeling; that's how his\r\naction must have appeared to him.\r\n\r\nAnother question presented itself to me more than once. Why did he run\r\naway, that is, literally run away on foot, rather than simply drive\r\naway? I put it down at first to the impracticability of fifty years and\r\nthe fantastic bent of his mind under the influence of strong emotion.\r\nI imagined that the thought of posting tickets and horses (even if\r\nthey had bells) would have seemed too simple and prosaic to him; a\r\npilgrimage, on the other hand, even under an umbrella, was ever so much\r\nmore picturesque and in character with love and resentment.","But now that\r\neverything is over, I am inclined to think that it all came about in a\r\nmuch simpler way. To begin with, he was afraid to hire horses because\r\nVarvara Petrovna might have heard of it and prevented him from going by\r\nforce; which she certainly would have done, and he certainly would have\r\ngiven in, and then farewell to the great idea forever. Besides, to take\r\ntickets for anywhere he must have known at least where he was going.","But\r\nto think about that was the greatest agony to him at that moment; he\r\nwas utterly unable to fix upon a place. For if he had to fix on any\r\nparticular town his enterprise would at once have seemed in his own eyes\r\nabsurd and impossible; he felt that very strongly. What should he do in\r\nthat particular town rather than in any other? Look out for _ce marchand_?\r\nBut what _marchand_? At that point his second and most terrible question\r\ncropped up.","In reality there was nothing he dreaded more than _ce\r\nmarchand_, whom he had rushed off to seek so recklessly, though, of\r\ncourse, he was terribly afraid of finding him. No, better simply the\r\nhigh road, better simply to set off for it, and walk along it and to\r\nthink of nothing so long as he could put off thinking. The high road is\r\nsomething very very long, of which one cannot see the end--like human\r\nlife, like human dreams.","There is an idea in the open road, but what\r\nsort of idea is there in travelling with posting tickets? Posting\r\ntickets mean an end to ideas. _Vive la grande route_ and then as God\r\nwills.\r\n\r\nAfter the sudden and unexpected interview with Liza which I have\r\ndescribed, he rushed on, more lost in forgetfulness than ever. The high\r\nroad passed half a mile from Skvoreshniki and, strange to say, he was\r\nnot at first aware that he was on it.","Logical reasoning or even distinct\r\nconsciousness was unbearable to him at this moment. A fine rain kept\r\ndrizzling, ceasing, and drizzling again; but he did not even notice\r\nthe rain. He did not even notice either how he threw his bag over his\r\nshoulder, nor how much more comfortably he walked with it so. He must\r\nhave walked like that for nearly a mile or so when he suddenly stood\r\nstill and looked round.","The old road, black, marked with wheel-ruts\r\nand planted with willows on each side, ran before him like an endless\r\nthread; on the right hand were bare plains from which the harvest had\r\nlong ago been carried; on the left there were bushes and in the distance\r\nbeyond them a copse.\r\n\r\nAnd far, far away a scarcely perceptible line of the railway, running\r\naslant, and on it the smoke of a train, but no sound was heard.","Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch felt a little timid, but only for a moment. He heaved a\r\nvague sigh, put down his bag beside a willow, and sat down to rest.\r\nAs he moved to sit down he was conscious of being chilly and wrapped\r\nhimself in his rug; noticing at the same time that it was raining, he\r\nput up his umbrella. He sat like that for some time, moving his lips\r\nfrom time to time and firmly grasping the umbrella handle.","Images of all\r\nsorts passed in feverish procession before him, rapidly succeeding one\r\nanother in his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Lise, Lise,\" he thought, \"and with her _ce Maurice_.... Strange\r\npeople.... But what was the strange fire, and what were they talking\r\nabout, and who were murdered? I fancy Nastasya has not found out yet and\r\nis still waiting for me with my coffee... cards? Did I really lose men\r\nat cards? H'm! Among us in Russia in the times of serfdom, so called.","...\r\nMy God, yes--Fedka!\"\r\n\r\nHe started all over with terror and looked about him. \"What if that\r\nFedka is in hiding somewhere behind the bushes? They say he has a\r\nregular band of robbers here on the high road. Oh, mercy, I... I'll\r\ntell him the whole truth then, that I was to blame... and that I've\r\nbeen miserable about him _for ten years_. More miserable than he was as\r\na soldier, and... I'll give him my purse.","H'm! _J'ai en tout quarante\r\nroubles; il prendra les roubles et il me tuera tout de m√™me._\"\r\n\r\nIn his panic he for some reason shut up the umbrella and laid it down\r\nbeside him. A cart came into sight on the high road in the distance\r\ncoming from the town.\r\n\r\n\"_Grace √† Dieu_, that's a cart and it's coming at a walking pace; that\r\ncan't be dangerous. The wretched little horses here... I always said\r\nthat breed.",".. It was Pyotr Ilyitch though, he talked at the club\r\nabout horse-breeding and I trumped him, _et puis_... but what's that\r\nbehind?... I believe there's a woman in the cart. A peasant and a woman,\r\n_cela commence √† √™tre rassurant._ The woman behind and the man in front--\r\n_c'est tr√®s rassurant._ There's a cow behind the cart tied by the horns,\r\n_c'est rassurant au plus haut degr√©._\"\r\n\r\nThe cart reached him; it was a fairly solid peasant cart.","The woman was\r\nsitting on a tightly stuffed sack and the man on the front of the cart\r\nwith his legs hanging over towards Stepan Trofimovitch. A red cow was,\r\nin fact, shambling behind, tied by the horns to the cart. The man\r\nand the woman gazed open-eyed at Stepan Trofimovitch, and Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch gazed back at them with equal wonder, but after he had let\r\nthem pass twenty paces, he got up hurriedly all of a sudden and walked\r\nafter them.","In the proximity of the cart it was natural that he\r\nshould feel safer, but when he had overtaken it he became oblivious\r\nof everything again and sank back into his disconnected thoughts and\r\nfancies. He stepped along with no suspicion, of course, that for the\r\ntwo peasants he was at that instant the most mysterious and interesting\r\nobject that one could meet on the high road.\r\n\r\n\"What sort may you be, pray, if it's not uncivil to ask?\" the woman\r\ncould not resist asking at last when Stepan Trofimovitch glanced\r\nabsent-mindedly at her.","She was a woman of about seven and twenty,\r\nsturdily built, with black eyebrows, rosy cheeks, and a friendly smile\r\non her red lips, between which gleamed white even teeth.\r\n\r\n\"You... you are addressing me?\" muttered Stepan Trofimovitch with\r\nmournful wonder.\r\n\r\n\"A merchant, for sure,\" the peasant observed confidently. He was a\r\nwell-grown man of forty with a broad and intelligent face, framed in a\r\nreddish beard.","\"No, I am not exactly a merchant, I... I... _moi c'est autre chose._\"\r\nStepan Trofimovitch parried the question somehow, and to be on the safe\r\nside he dropped back a little from the cart, so that he was walking on a\r\nlevel with the cow.\r\n\r\n\"Must be a gentleman,\" the man decided, hearing words not Russian, and\r\nhe gave a tug at the horse.\r\n\r\n\"That's what set us wondering. You are out for a walk seemingly?\" the\r\nwoman asked inquisitively again.","\"You... you ask me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Foreigners come from other parts sometimes by the train; your boots\r\ndon't seem to be from hereabouts....\"\r\n\r\n\"They are army boots,\" the man put in complacently and significantly.\r\n\r\n\"No, I am not precisely in the army, I...\"\r\n\r\n\"What an inquisitive woman!\" Stepan Trofimovitch mused with vexation.\r\n\"And how they stare at me... _mais enfin_. In fact, it's strange that I\r\nfeel, as it were, conscience-stricken before them, and yet I've done\r\nthem no harm.","\"\r\n\r\nThe woman was whispering to the man.\r\n\r\n\"If it's no offence, we'd give you a lift if so be it's agreeable.\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch suddenly roused himself.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, my friends, I accept it with pleasure, for I'm very tired;\r\nbut how am I to get in?\"\r\n\r\n\"How wonderful it is,\" he thought to himself, \"that I've been walking\r\nso long beside that cow and it never entered my head to ask them for a\r\nlift.","This 'real life' has something very original about it.\"\r\n\r\nBut the peasant had not, however, pulled up the horse.\r\n\r\n\"But where are you bound for?\" he asked with some mistrustfulness.\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch did not understand him at once.\r\n\r\n\"To Hatovo, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hatov? No, not to Hatov's exactly... And I don't know him though I've\r\nheard of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"The village of Hatovo, the village, seven miles from here.","\"\r\n\r\n\"A village? _C'est charmant,_ to be sure I've heard of it....\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch was still walking, they had not yet taken him into\r\nthe cart. A guess that was a stroke of genius flashed through his mind.\r\n\r\n\"You think perhaps that I am... I've got a passport and I am a\r\nprofessor, that is, if you like, a teacher... but a head teacher. I am a\r\nhead teacher. _Oui, c'est comme √ßa qu'on peut traduire.","_ I should be very\r\nglad of a lift and I'll buy you... I'll buy you a quart of vodka for\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"It'll be half a rouble, sir; it's a bad road.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or it wouldn't be fair to ourselves,\" put in the woman.\r\n\r\n\"Half a rouble? Very good then, half a rouble. _C'est encore mieux; j'ai\r\nen tout quarante roubles mais_...\"\r\n\r\nThe peasant stopped the horse and by their united efforts Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch was dragged into the cart, and seated on the sack by the\r\nwoman.","He was still pursued by the same whirl of ideas. Sometimes he was\r\naware himself that he was terribly absent-minded, and that he was not\r\nthinking of what he ought to be thinking of and wondered at it. This\r\nconsciousness of abnormal weakness of mind became at moments very\r\npainful and even humiliating to him.\r\n\r\n\"How... how is this you've got a cow behind?\" he suddenly asked the\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, sir, as though you'd never seen one,\" laughed the\r\nwoman.","\"We bought it in the town,\" the peasant put in. \"Our cattle died last\r\nspring... the plague. All the beasts have died round us, all of them.\r\nThere aren't half of them left, it's heartbreaking.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again he lashed the horse, which had got stuck in a rut.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that does happen among you in Russia... in general we Russians...\r\nWell, yes, it happens,\" Stepan Trofimovitch broke off.\r\n\r\n\"If you are a teacher, what are you going to Hatovo for? Maybe you are\r\ngoing on farther.","\"\r\n\r\n\"I... I'm not going farther precisely.... _C'est-√†-dire,_ I'm going to a\r\nmerchant's.\"\r\n\r\n\"To Spasov, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, to Spasov. But that's no matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you are going to Spasov and on foot, it will take you a week in your\r\nboots,\" laughed the woman.\r\n\r\n\"I dare say, I dare say, no matter, _mes amis_, no matter.\" Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch cut her short impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Awfully inquisitive people; but the woman speaks better than he does,\r\nand I notice that since February 19,* their language has altered a\r\nlittle, and.",".. and what business is it of mine whether I'm going to\r\nSpasov or not? Besides, I'll pay them, so why do they pester me.\"\r\n\r\n     *February 19, 1861, the day of the Emancipation of the Serfs, is\r\n      meant.--Translator's note.\r\n\r\n\"If you are going to Spasov, you must take the steamer,\" the peasant\r\npersisted.\r\n\r\n\"That's true indeed,\" the woman put in with animation, \"for if you\r\ndrive along the bank it's twenty-five miles out of the way.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-five.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll just catch the steamer at Ustyevo at two o'clock tomorrow,\" the\r\nwoman decided finally. But Stepan Trofimovitch was obstinately silent.\r\nHis questioners, too, sank into silence. The peasant tugged at his horse\r\nat rare intervals; the peasant woman exchanged brief remarks with him.\r\nStepan Trofimovitch fell into a doze. He was tremendously surprised when\r\nthe woman, laughing, gave him a poke and he found himself in a rather\r\nlarge village at the door of a cottage with three windows.","\"You've had a nap, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it? Where am I? Ah, yes! Well... never mind,\" sighed Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch, and he got out of the cart.\r\n\r\nHe looked about him mournfully; the village scene seemed strange to him\r\nand somehow terribly remote.\r\n\r\n\"And the half-rouble, I was forgetting it!\" he said to the peasant,\r\nturning to him with an excessively hurried gesture; he was evidently by\r\nnow afraid to part from them.","\"We'll settle indoors, walk in,\" the peasant invited him.\r\n\r\n\"It's comfortable inside,\" the woman said reassuringly.\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch mounted the shaky steps. \"How can it be?\" he\r\nmurmured in profound and apprehensive perplexity. He went into the\r\ncottage, however. _\"Elle l'a voulu\"_ he felt a stab at his heart and again\r\nhe became oblivious of everything, even of the fact that he had gone\r\ninto the cottage.","It was a light and fairly clean peasant's cottage, with three windows\r\nand two rooms; not exactly an inn, but a cottage at which people\r\nwho knew the place were accustomed to stop on their way through the\r\nvillage. Stepan Trofimovitch, quite unembarrassed, went to the foremost\r\ncorner; forgot to greet anyone, sat down and sank into thought.\r\nMeanwhile a sensation of warmth, extremely agreeable after three hours\r\nof travelling in the damp, was suddenly diffused throughout his person.","Even the slight shivers that spasmodically ran down his spine--such as\r\nalways occur in particularly nervous people when they are feverish and\r\nhave suddenly come into a warm room from the cold--became all at once\r\nstrangely agreeable. He raised his head and the delicious fragrance of\r\nthe hot pancakes with which the woman of the house was busy at the stove\r\ntickled his nostrils. With a childlike smile he leaned towards the woman\r\nand suddenly said:\r\n\r\n\"What's that? Are they pancakes? _Mais.",".. c'est charmant._\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you like some, sir?\" the woman politely offered him at once.\r\n\r\n\"I should like some, I certainly should, and... may I ask you for some\r\ntea too,\" said Stepan Trofimovitch, reviving.\r\n\r\n\"Get the samovar? With the greatest pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nOn a large plate with a big blue pattern on it were served the\r\npancakes--regular peasant pancakes, thin, made half of wheat, covered\r\nwith fresh hot butter, most delicious pancakes.","Stepan Trofimovitch\r\ntasted them with relish.\r\n\r\n\"How rich they are and how good! And if one could only have _un doigt\r\nd'eau de vie_.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a drop of vodka you would like, sir, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so, just so, a little, _un tout petit rien_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Five farthings' worth, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five, yes, five, five, five, _un tout petit rien_,\" Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nassented with a blissful smile.\r\n\r\nAsk a peasant to do anything for you, and if he can, and will, he\r\nwill serve you with care and friendliness; but ask him to fetch you\r\nvodka--and his habitual serenity and friendliness will pass at once into\r\na sort of joyful haste and alacrity; he will be as keen in your\r\ninterest as though you were one of his family.","The peasant who fetches\r\nvodka--even though you are going to drink it and not he and he knows\r\nthat beforehand--seems, as it were, to be enjoying part of your future\r\ngratification. Within three minutes (the tavern was only two paces\r\naway), a bottle and a large greenish wineglass were set on the table\r\nbefore Stepan Trofimovitch.\r\n\r\n\"Is that all for me!\" He was extremely surprised. \"I've always had vodka\r\nbut I never knew you could get so much for five farthings.","\"\r\n\r\nHe filled the wineglass, got up and with a certain solemnity crossed the\r\nroom to the other corner where his fellow-traveller, the black-browed\r\npeasant woman, who had shared the sack with him and bothered him with\r\nher questions, had ensconced herself. The woman was taken aback, and\r\nbegan to decline, but after having said all that was prescribed by\r\npoliteness, she stood up and drank it decorously in three sips, as women\r\ndo, and, with an expression of intense suffering on her face, gave back\r\nthe wineglass and bowed to Stepan Trofimovitch.","He returned the bow with\r\ndignity and returned to the table with an expression of positive pride\r\non his countenance.\r\n\r\nAll this was done on the inspiration of the moment: a second before he\r\nhad no idea that he would go and treat the peasant woman.\r\n\r\n\"I know how to get on with peasants to perfection, to perfection, and\r\nI've always told them so,\" he thought complacently, pouring out the rest\r\nof the vodka; though there was less than a glass left, it warmed and\r\nrevived him, and even went a little to his head.","_\"Je suis malade tout √† fait, mais ce n'est pas trop mauvais d'√™tre\r\nmalade.\"_\r\n\r\n\"Would you care to purchase?\" a gentle feminine voice asked close by\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyes and to his surprise saw a lady--_une dame et elle en\r\navait l'air,_ somewhat over thirty, very modest in appearance, dressed not\r\nlike a peasant, in a dark gown with a grey shawl on her shoulders.\r\nThere was something very kindly in her face which attracted Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch immediately.","She had only just come back to the cottage,\r\nwhere her things had been left on a bench close by the place where\r\nStepan Trofimovitch had seated himself. Among them was a portfolio,\r\nat which he remembered he had looked with curiosity on going in, and a\r\npack, not very large, of American leather. From this pack she took out\r\ntwo nicely bound books with a cross engraved on the cover, and offered\r\nthem to Stepan Trofimovitch.","\"_Et... mais je crois que c'est l'Evangile..._ with the greatest\r\npleasure.... Ah, now I understand.... _Vous √™tes ce qu'on appelle_ a\r\ngospel-woman; I've read more than once.... Half a rouble?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-five kopecks,\" answered the gospel-woman. \"With the greatest\r\npleasure. _Je n'ai rien contre l'Evangile,_ and I've been wanting to\r\nre-read it for a long time....\"\r\n\r\nThe idea occurred to him at the moment that he had not read the gospel\r\nfor thirty years at least, and at most had recalled some passages of it,\r\nseven years before, when reading Renan's \"Vie de J√©sus.","\" As he had no\r\nsmall change he pulled out his four ten-rouble notes--all that he\r\nhad. The woman of the house undertook to get change, and only then\r\nhe noticed, looking round, that a good many people had come into the\r\ncottage, and that they had all been watching him for some time past, and\r\nseemed to be talking about him. They were talking too of the fire in the\r\ntown, especially the owner of the cart who had only just returned from\r\nthe town with the cow.","They talked of arson, of the Shpigulin men.\r\n\r\n\"He said nothing to me about the fire when he brought me along, although\r\nhe talked of everything,\" struck Stepan Trofimovitch for some reason.\r\n\r\n\"Master, Stepan Trofimovitch, sir, is it you I see? Well, I never should\r\nhave thought it!... Don't you know me?\" exclaimed a middle-aged man who\r\nlooked like an old-fashioned house-serf, wearing no beard and dressed\r\nin an overcoat with a wide turn-down collar.","Stepan Trofimovitch was\r\nalarmed at hearing his own name.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me,\" he muttered, \"I don't quite remember you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't remember me. I am Anisim, Anisim Ivanov. I used to be in the\r\nservice of the late Mr. Gaganov, and many's the time I've seen you, sir,\r\nwith Varvara Petrovna at the late Avdotya Sergyevna's. I used to go to\r\nyou with books from her, and twice I brought you Petersburg sweets from\r\nher.","...\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes, I remember you, Anisim,\" said Stepan Trofimovitch, smiling.\r\n\"Do you live here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I live near Spasov, close to the V---- Monastery, in the service\r\nof Marta Sergyevna, Avdotya Sergyevna's sister. Perhaps your honour\r\nremembers her; she broke her leg falling out of her carriage on her\r\nway to a ball. Now her honour lives near the monastery, and I am in her\r\nservice. And now as your honour sees, I am on my way to the town to see\r\nmy kinsfolk.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so, quite so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I felt so pleased when I saw you, you used to be so kind to me,\"\r\nAnisim smiled delightedly. \"But where are you travelling to, sir, all by\r\nyourself as it seems.... You've never been a journey alone, I fancy?\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch looked at him in alarm.\r\n\r\n\"You are going, maybe, to our parts, to Spasov?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am going to Spasov. _Il me semble que tout le monde va √†\r\nSpassof.","_\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say it's to Fyodor Matveyevitch's? They will be pleased to\r\nsee you. He had such a respect for you in old days; he often speaks of\r\nyou now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, to Fyodor Matveyevitch's.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure, to be sure. The peasants here are wondering; they make out\r\nthey met you, sir, walking on the high road. They are a foolish lot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I... I... Yes, you know, Anisim, I made a wager, you know, like an\r\nEnglishman, that I would go on foot and I.","..\"\r\n\r\nThe perspiration came out on his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure, to be sure.\" Anisim listened with merciless curiosity. But\r\nStepan Trofimovitch could bear it no longer. He was so disconcerted that\r\nhe was on the point of getting up and going out of the cottage. But the\r\nsamovar was brought in, and at the same moment the gospel-woman, who\r\nhad been out of the room, returned. With the air of a man clutching at a\r\nstraw he turned to her and offered her tea.","Anisim submitted and walked\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe peasants certainly had begun to feel perplexed: \"What sort of person\r\nis he? He was found walking on the high road, he says he is a teacher,\r\nhe is dressed like a foreigner, and has no more sense than a little\r\nchild; he answers queerly as though he had run away from someone, and\r\nhe's got money!\" An idea was beginning to gain ground that information\r\nmust be given to the authorities, \"especially as things weren't quite\r\nright in the town.","\" But Anisim set all that right in a minute. Going\r\ninto the passage he explained to every one who cared to listen that\r\nStepan Trofimovitch was not exactly a teacher but \"a very learned man\r\nand busy with very learned studies, and was a landowner of the district\r\nhimself, and had been living for twenty-two years with her excellency,\r\nthe general's widow, the stout Madame Stavrogin, and was by way of being\r\nthe most important person in her house, and was held in the greatest\r\nrespect by every one in the town.","He used to lose by fifties and\r\nhundreds in an evening at the club of the nobility, and in rank he was\r\na councillor, which was equal to a lieutenant-colonel in the army, which\r\nwas next door to being a colonel. As for his having money, he had\r\nso much from the stout Madame Stavrogin that there was no reckoning\r\nit\"--and so on and so on.\r\n\r\n_\"Mais c'est une dame et tr√®s comme il faut,\"_ thought Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch, as he recovered from Anisim's attack, gazing with\r\nagreeable curiosity at his neighbour, the gospel pedlar, who was,\r\nhowever, drinking the tea from a saucer and nibbling at a piece of\r\nsugar.","\"_Ce petit morceau de sucre, ce n'est rien...._ There is something\r\nnoble and independent about her, and at the same time--gentle. _Le comme\r\nil faut tout pur,_ but rather in a different style.\"\r\n\r\nHe soon learned from her that her name was Sofya Matveyevna Ulitin and\r\nshe lived at K----, that she had a sister there, a widow; that she was a\r\nwidow too, and that her husband, who was a sub-lieutenant risen from the\r\nranks, had been killed at Sevastopol.","\"But you are still so young, _vous n'avez pas trente ans_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-four,\" said Sofya Matveyevna, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"What, you understand French?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little. I lived for four years after that in a gentleman's family,\r\nand there I picked it up from the children.\"\r\n\r\nShe told him that being left a widow at eighteen she was for some time\r\nin Sevastopol as a nurse, and had afterwards lived in various places,\r\nand now she travelled about selling the gospel.","\"_Mais, mon Dieu,_ wasn't it you who had a strange adventure in our town,\r\na very strange adventure?\"\r\n\r\nShe flushed; it turned out that it had been she.\r\n\r\n_\"Ces vauriens, ces malheureux,\"_ he began in a voice quivering with\r\nindignation; miserable and hateful recollections stirred painfully in\r\nhis heart. For a minute he seemed to sink into oblivion.\r\n\r\n\"Bah, but she's gone away again,\" he thought, with a start, noticing\r\nthat she was not by his side.","\"She keeps going out and is busy about\r\nsomething; I notice that she seems upset too.... _Bah, je deviens\r\negoiste!_\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyes and saw Anisim again, but this time in the most\r\nmenacing surroundings. The whole cottage was full of peasants, and it\r\nwas evidently Anisim who had brought them all in. Among them were the\r\nmaster of the house, and the peasant with the cow, two other peasants\r\n(they turned out to be cab-drivers), another little man, half drunk,\r\ndressed like a peasant but clean-shaven, who seemed like a townsman\r\nruined by drink and talked more than any of them.","And they were all\r\ndiscussing him, Stepan Trofimovitch. The peasant with the cow insisted\r\non his point that to go round by the lake would be thirty-five miles out\r\nof the way, and that he certainly must go by steamer. The half-drunken\r\nman and the man of the house warmly retorted:\r\n\r\n\"Seeing that, though of course it will be nearer for his honour on\r\nthe steamer over the lake; that's true enough, but maybe according to\r\npresent arrangements the steamer doesn't go there, brother.","\"\r\n\r\n\"It does go, it does, it will go for another week,\" cried Anisim, more\r\nexcited than any of them.\r\n\r\n\"That's true enough, but it doesn't arrive punctually, seeing it's late\r\nin the season, and sometimes it'll stay three days together at Ustyevo.\"\r\n\r\n\"It'll be there to-morrow at two o'clock punctually. You'll be at Spasov\r\npunctually by the evening,\" cried Anisim, eager to do his best for\r\nStepan Trofimovitch.","_\"Mais qu'est-ce qu'il a cet homme,\"_ thought Stepan Trofimovitch,\r\ntrembling and waiting in terror for what was in store for him.\r\n\r\nThe cab-drivers, too, came forward and began bargaining with him; they\r\nasked three roubles to Ustyevo. The others shouted that that was not too\r\nmuch, that that was the fare, and that they had been driving from here\r\nto Ustyevo all the summer for that fare.\r\n\r\n\"But.",".. it's nice here too.... And I don't want...\" Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nmumbled in protest.\r\n\r\n\"Nice it is, sir, you are right there, it's wonderfully nice at Spasov\r\nnow and Fyodor Matveyevitch will be so pleased to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Mon Dieu, mes amis,_ all this is such a surprise to me.\"\r\n\r\nAt last Sofya Matveyevna came back. But she sat down on the bench\r\nlooking dejected and mournful.\r\n\r\n\"I can't get to Spasov!\" she said to the woman of the cottage.","\"Why, you are bound to Spasov, too, then?\" cried Stepan Trofimovitch,\r\nstarting.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that a lady had the day before told her to wait at Hatovo\r\nand had promised to take her to Spasov, and now this lady had not turned\r\nup after all.\r\n\r\n\"What am I to do now?\" repeated Sofya Matveyevna.\r\n\r\n\"_Mais, ma ch√®re et nouvelle amie,_ I can take you just as well as the\r\nlady to that village, whatever it is, to which I've hired horses, and\r\nto-morrow--well, to-morrow, we'll go on together to Spasov.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, are you going to Spasov too?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Mais que faire, et je suis enchant√©!_ I shall take you with the greatest\r\npleasure; you see they want to take me, I've engaged them already.\r\nWhich of you did I engage?\" Stepan Trofimovitch suddenly felt an intense\r\ndesire to go to Spasov.\r\n\r\nWithin a quarter of an hour they were getting into a covered trap, he\r\nvery lively and quite satisfied, she with her pack beside him, with a\r\ngrateful smile on her face.","Anisim helped them in.\r\n\r\n\"A good journey to you, sir,\" said he, bustling officiously round the\r\ntrap, \"it has been a treat to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, good-bye, my friend, good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll see Fyodor Matveyevitch, sir...\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my friend, yes... Fyodor Petrovitch... only good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\"You see, my friend... you'll allow me to call myself your friend,\r\nn'est-ce pas?\" Stepan Trofimovitch began hurriedly as soon as the trap\r\nstarted.","\"You see I... _J'aime le peuple, c'est indispensable, mais il me\r\nsemble que je ne m'avais jamais vu de pr√®s. Stasie... cela va sans dire\r\nqu'elle est aussi du peuple, mais le vrai peuple,_ that is, the real\r\nones, who are on the high road, it seems to me they care for nothing,\r\nbut where exactly I am going... But let bygones be bygones. I fancy I am\r\ntalking at random, but I believe it's from being flustered.","\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't seem quite well.\" Sofya Matveyevna watched him keenly though\r\nrespectfully.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, I must only wrap myself up, besides there's a fresh wind, very\r\nfresh in fact, but... let us forget that. That's not what I really meant\r\nto say. _Ch√®re et incomparable amie,_ I feel that I am almost happy, and\r\nit's your doing. Happiness is not good for me for it makes me rush to\r\nforgive all my enemies at once.","...\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that's a very good thing, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not always, _ch√®re innocente. L'Evangile... voyez-vous, d√©sormais nous\r\npr√™cherons ensemble_ and I will gladly sell your beautiful little books.\r\nYes, I feel that that perhaps is an idea, _quelque chose de tr√®s nouveau\r\ndans ce genre._ The peasants are religious, _c'est admis,_ but they don't\r\nyet know the gospel. I will expound it to them.... By verbal explanation\r\none might correct the mistakes in that remarkable book, which I am of\r\ncourse prepared to treat with the utmost respect.","I will be of service\r\neven on the high road. I've always been of use, I always told _them_ so _et\r\n√† cette ch√®re ingrate...._ Oh, we will forgive, we will forgive, first\r\nof all we will forgive all and always.... We will hope that we too shall\r\nbe forgiven. Yes, for all, every one of us, have wronged one another,\r\nall are guilty!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a very good saying, I think, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes.... I feel that I am speaking well.","I shall speak to them very\r\nwell, but what was the chief thing I meant to say? I keep losing the\r\nthread and forgetting.... Will you allow me to remain with you? I\r\nfeel that the look in your eyes and... I am surprised in fact at your\r\nmanners. You are simple-hearted, you call me 'sir,' and turn your cup\r\nupside down on your saucer... and that horrid lump of sugar; but there's\r\nsomething charming about you, and I see from your features.","... Oh,\r\ndon't blush and don't be afraid of me as a man. _Ch√®re et incomparable,\r\npour moi une femme c'est tout._ I can't live without a woman, but only\r\nat her side, only at her side... I am awfully muddled, awfully. I can't\r\nremember what I meant to say. Oh, blessed is he to whom God always sends\r\na woman and... and I fancy, indeed, that I am in a sort of ecstasy.\r\nThere's a lofty idea in the open road too! That's what I meant to say,\r\nthat's it--about the idea.","Now I've remembered it, but I kept losing it\r\nbefore. And why have they taken us farther. It was nice there too, but\r\nhere--_cela devien trop froid. A propos, j'ai en tout quarante roubles\r\net voil√† cet argent,_ take it, take it, I can't take care of it, I shall\r\nlose it or it will be taken away from me.... I seem to be sleepy, I've\r\na giddiness in my head. Yes, I am giddy, I am giddy, I am giddy.","Oh, how\r\nkind you are, what's that you are wrapping me up in?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are certainly in a regular fever and I've covered you with my rug;\r\nonly about the money, I'd rather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, for God's sake, _n'en parlons plus parce que cela me fait mal._ Oh,\r\nhow kind you are!\"\r\n\r\nHe ceased speaking, and with strange suddenness dropped into a feverish\r\nshivery sleep. The road by which they drove the twelve miles was not a\r\nsmooth one, and their carriage jolted cruelly.","Stepan Trofimovitch woke\r\nup frequently, quickly raised his head from the little pillow which\r\nSofya Matveyevna had slipped under it, clutched her by the hand and\r\nasked \"Are you here?\" as though he were afraid she had left him. He told\r\nher, too, that he had dreamed of gaping jaws full of teeth, and that he\r\nhad very much disliked it. Sofya Matveyevna was in great anxiety about\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThey were driven straight up to a large cottage with a frontage of\r\nfour windows and other rooms in the yard.","Stepan Trofimovitch waked up,\r\nhurriedly went in and walked straight into the second room, which was\r\nthe largest and best in the house. An expression of fussiness came into\r\nhis sleepy face. He spoke at once to the landlady, a tall, thick-set\r\nwoman of forty with very dark hair and a slight moustache, and explained\r\nthat he required the whole room for himself, and that the door was to be\r\nshut and no one else was to be admitted, \"_parce que nous avons √† parler.","Oui, j'ai beaucoup √† vous dire, ch√®re amie._ I'll pay you, I'll pay you,\"\r\nhe said with a wave of dismissal to the landlady.\r\n\r\nThough he was in a hurry, he seemed to articulate with difficulty. The\r\nlandlady listened grimly, and was silent in token of consent, but there\r\nwas a feeling of something menacing about her silence. He did not notice\r\nthis, and hurriedly (he was in a terrible hurry) insisted on her going\r\naway and bringing them their dinner as quickly as possible, without a\r\nmoment's delay.","At that point the moustached woman could contain herself no longer.\r\n\r\n\"This is not an inn, sir; we don't provide dinners for travellers. We\r\ncan boil you some crayfish or set the samovar, but we've nothing more.\r\nThere won't be fresh fish till to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nBut Stepan Trofimovitch waved his hands, repeating with wrathful\r\nimpatience: \"I'll pay, only make haste, make haste.\"\r\n\r\nThey settled on fish, soup, and roast fowl; the landlady declared that\r\nfowl was not to be procured in the whole village; she agreed, however,\r\nto go in search of one, but with the air of doing him an immense favour.","As soon as she had gone Stepan Trofimovitch instantly sat down on the\r\nsofa and made Sofya Matveyevna sit down beside him. There were several\r\narm-chairs as well as a sofa in the room, but they were of a most\r\nuninviting appearance. The room was rather a large one, with a corner,\r\nin which there was a bed, partitioned off. It was covered with old and\r\ntattered yellow paper, and had horrible lithographs of mythological\r\nsubjects on the walls; in the corner facing the door there was a long\r\nrow of painted ikons and several sets of brass ones.","The whole room with\r\nits strangely ill-assorted furniture was an unattractive mixture of the\r\ntown element and of peasant traditions. But he did not even glance at it\r\nall, nor look out of the window at the vast lake, the edge of which was\r\nonly seventy feet from the cottage.\r\n\r\n\"At last we are by ourselves and we will admit no one! I want to tell\r\nyou everything, everything from the very beginning.","\"\r\n\r\nSofya Matveyevna checked him with great uneasiness.\r\n\r\n\"Are you aware, Stepan Trofimovitch?...\"\r\n\r\n_\"Comment, vous savez d√©j√† mon nom?\"_ He smiled with delight.\r\n\r\n\"I heard it this morning from Anisim Ivanovitch when you were talking to\r\nhim. But I venture to tell you for my part...\"\r\n\r\nAnd she whispered hurriedly to him, looking nervously at the closed\r\ndoor for fear anyone should overhear--that here in this village, it was\r\ndreadful.","That though all the peasants were fishermen, they made their\r\nliving chiefly by charging travellers every summer whatever they\r\nthought fit. The village was not on the high road but an out-of-the-way\r\none, and people only called there because the steamers stopped there,\r\nand that when the steamer did not call--and if the weather was in the\r\nleast unfavourable, it would not--then numbers of travellers would be\r\nwaiting there for several days, and all the cottages in the village\r\nwould be occupied, and that was just the villagers' opportunity, for\r\nthey charged three times its value for everything--and their landlord\r\nhere was proud and stuck up because he was, for these parts, very rich;\r\nhe had a net which had cost a thousand roubles.","Stepan Trofimovitch looked almost reproachfully at Sofya Matveyevna's\r\nextremely excited face, and several times he made a motion to stop her.\r\nBut she persisted and said all she had to say: she said she had been\r\nthere before already in the summer \"with a very genteel lady from the\r\ntown,\" and stayed there too for two whole days till the steamer came,\r\nand what they had to put up with did not bear thinking of.","\"Here, Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch, you've been pleased to ask for this room for yourself\r\nalone.... I only speak to warn you.... In the other room there are\r\ntravellers already. An elderly man and a young man and a lady with\r\nchildren, and by to-morrow before two o'clock the whole house will be\r\nfilled up, for since the steamer hasn't been here for two days it will\r\nbe sure to come to-morrow. So for a room apart and for ordering dinner,\r\nand for putting out the other travellers, they'll charge you a price\r\nunheard of even in the capital.","...\"\r\n\r\nBut he was in distress, in real distress. \"_Assez, mon enfant,_ I beseech\r\nyou, _nous avons notre argent--et apr√®s, le bon Dieu._ And I am surprised\r\nthat, with the loftiness of your ideas, you... _Assez, assez, vous me\r\ntourmentez,_\" he articulated hysterically, \"we have all our future before\r\nus, and you... you fill me with alarm for the future.\"\r\n\r\nHe proceeded at once to unfold his whole story with such haste that at\r\nfirst it was difficult to understand him.","It went on for a long time.\r\nThe soup was served, the fowl was brought in, followed at last by the\r\nsamovar, and still he talked on. He told it somewhat strangely and\r\nhysterically, and indeed he was ill. It was a sudden, extreme effort\r\nof his intellectual faculties, which was bound in his overstrained\r\ncondition, of course--Sofya Matveyevna foresaw it with distress all\r\nthe time he was talking--to result immediately afterwards in extreme\r\nexhaustion.","He began his story almost with his childhood, when, \"with\r\nfresh heart, he ran about the meadows; it was an hour before he reached\r\nhis two marriages and his life in Berlin. I dare not laugh, however. It\r\nreally was for him a matter of the utmost importance, and to adopt the\r\nmodern jargon, almost a question of struggling for existence.\" He saw\r\nbefore him the woman whom he had already elected to share his new life,\r\nand was in haste to consecrate her, so to speak.","His genius must not be\r\nhidden from her.... Perhaps he had formed a very exaggerated estimate\r\nof Sofya Matveyevna, but he had already chosen her. He could not exist\r\nwithout a woman. He saw clearly from her face that she hardly understood\r\nhim, and could not grasp even the most essential part. \"_Ce n'est rien,\r\nnous attendrons,_ and meanwhile she can feel it intuitively.... My\r\nfriend, I need nothing but your heart!\" he exclaimed, interrupting his\r\nnarrative, \"and that sweet enchanting look with which you are gazing at\r\nme now.","Oh, don't blush! I've told you already...\" The poor woman who\r\nhad fallen into his hands found much that was obscure, especially when\r\nhis autobiography almost passed into a complete dissertation on the fact\r\nthat no one had been ever able to understand Stepan Trofimovitch,\r\nand that \"men of genius are wasted in Russia.\" It was all \"so very\r\nintellectual,\" she reported afterwards dejectedly. She listened in\r\nevident misery, rather round-eyed.","When Stepan Trofimovitch fell into\r\na humorous vein and threw off witty sarcasms at the expense of our\r\nadvanced and governing classes, she twice made grievous efforts to laugh\r\nin response to his laughter, but the result was worse than tears, so\r\nthat Stepan Trofimovitch was at last embarrassed by it himself and\r\nattacked \"the nihilists and modern people\" with all the greater wrath\r\nand zest. At this point he simply alarmed her, and it was not until he\r\nbegan upon the romance of his life that she felt some slight relief,\r\nthough that too was deceptive.","A woman is always a woman even if she is\r\na nun. She smiled, shook her head and then blushed crimson and dropped\r\nher eyes, which roused Stepan Trofimovitch to absolute ecstasy and\r\ninspiration so much that he began fibbing freely. Varvara Petrovna\r\nappeared in his story as an enchanting brunette (who had been the rage\r\nof Petersburg and many European capitals) and her husband \"had been\r\nstruck down on the field of Sevastopol\" simply because he had felt\r\nunworthy of her love, and had yielded her to his rival, that is, Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch.","... \"Don't be shocked, my gentle one, my Christian,\" he\r\nexclaimed to Sofya Matveyevna, almost believing himself in all that he\r\nwas telling, \"it was something so lofty, so subtle, that we never spoke\r\nof it to one another all our lives.\" As the story went on, the cause\r\nof this position of affairs appeared to be a blonde lady (if not Darya\r\nPavlovna I don't know of whom Stepan Trofimovitch could have been\r\nthinking), this blonde owed everything to the brunette, and had grown up\r\nin her house, being a distant relation.","The brunette observing at last\r\nthe love of the blonde girl to Stepan Trofimovitch, kept her feelings\r\nlocked up in her heart. The blonde girl, noticing on her part the love\r\nof the brunette to Stepan Trofimovitch, also locked her feelings in her\r\nown heart. And all three, pining with mutual magnanimity, kept silent in\r\nthis way for twenty years, locking their feelings in their hearts. \"Oh,\r\nwhat a passion that was, what a passion that was!\" he exclaimed with a\r\nstifled sob of genuine ecstasy.","\"I saw the full blooming of her beauty\"\r\n(of the brunette's, that is), \"I saw daily with an ache in my heart\r\nhow she passed by me as though ashamed she was so fair\" (once he said\r\n\"ashamed she was so fat\"). At last he had run away, casting off all this\r\nfeverish dream of twenty years--_vingt ans_--and now here he was on the\r\nhigh road....\r\n\r\nThen in a sort of delirium be began explaining to Sofya Matveyevna the\r\nsignificance of their meeting that day, \"so chance an encounter and\r\nso fateful for all eternity.","\" Sofya Matveyevna got up from the sofa in\r\nterrible confusion at last. He had positively made an attempt to drop on\r\nhis knees before her, which made her cry. It was beginning to get dark.\r\nThey had been for some hours shut up in the room....\r\n\r\n\"No, you'd better let me go into the other room,\" she faltered, \"or else\r\nthere's no knowing what people may think....\"\r\n\r\nShe tore herself away at last; he let her go, promising her to go to bed\r\nat once.","As they parted he complained that he had a bad headache. Sofya\r\nMatveyevna had on entering the cottage left her bag and things in the\r\nfirst room, meaning to spend the night with the people of the house; but\r\nshe got no rest.\r\n\r\nIn the night Stepan Trofimovitch was attacked by the malady with which\r\nI and all his friends were so familiar--the summer cholera, which was\r\nalways the outcome of any nervous strain or moral shock with him.","Poor\r\nSofya Matveyevna did not sleep all night. As in waiting on the invalid\r\nshe was obliged pretty often to go in and out of the cottage through the\r\nlandlady's room, the latter, as well as the travellers who were sleeping\r\nthere, grumbled and even began swearing when towards morning she set\r\nabout preparing the samovar. Stepan Trofimovitch was half unconscious\r\nall through the attack; at times he had a vision of the samovar being\r\nset, of someone giving him something to drink (raspberry tea), and\r\nputting something warm to his stomach and his chest.","But he felt almost\r\nevery instant that she was here, beside him; that it was she going out\r\nand coming in, lifting him off the bed and settling him in it again.\r\nTowards three o'clock in the morning he began to be easier; he sat up,\r\nput his legs out of bed and thinking of nothing he fell on the floor\r\nat her feet. This was a very different matter from the kneeling of the\r\nevening; he simply bowed down at her feet and kissed the hem of her\r\ndress.","\"Don't, sir, I am not worth it,\" she faltered, trying to get him back on\r\nto the bed.\r\n\r\n\"My saviour,\" he cried, clasping his hands reverently before her. \"_Vous\r\n√™tes noble comme une marquise!_ I--I am a wretch. Oh, I've been dishonest\r\nall my life....\"\r\n\r\n\"Calm yourself!\" Sofya Matveyevna implored him.\r\n\r\n\"It was all lies that I told you this evening--to glorify myself, to\r\nmake it splendid, from pure wantonness--all, all, every word, oh, I am a\r\nwretch, I am a wretch!\"\r\n\r\nThe first attack was succeeded in this way by a second--an attack\r\nof hysterical remorse.","I have mentioned these attacks already when I\r\ndescribed his letters to Varvara Petrovna. He suddenly recalled Lise\r\nand their meeting the previous morning. \"It was so awful, and there must\r\nhave been some disaster and I didn't ask, didn't find out! I thought\r\nonly of myself. Oh, what's the matter with her? Do you know what's the\r\nmatter with her?\" he besought Sofya Matveyevna.\r\n\r\nThen he swore that \"he would never change,\" that he would go back to\r\nher (that is, Varvara Petrovna).","\"We\" (that is, he and Sofya Matveyevna)\r\n\"will go to her steps every day when she is getting into her carriage\r\nfor her morning drive, and we will watch her in secret.... Oh, I wish\r\nher to smite me on the other cheek; it's a joy to wish it! I shall turn\r\nher my other cheek _comme dans votre livre!_ Only now for the first time\r\nI understand what is meant by... turning the other cheek. I never\r\nunderstood before!\"\r\n\r\nThe two days that followed were among the most terrible in Sofya\r\nMatveyevna's life; she remembers them with a shudder to this day.","Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch became so seriously ill that he could not go on board the\r\nsteamer, which on this occasion arrived punctually at two o'clock in the\r\nafternoon. She could not bring herself to leave him alone, so she\r\ndid not leave for Spasov either. From her account he was positively\r\ndelighted at the steamer's going without him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's a good thing, that's capital!\" he muttered in his bed.","\"I've been afraid all the time that we should go. Here it's so nice,\r\nbetter than anywhere.... You won't leave me? Oh, you have not left me!\"\r\n\r\nIt was by no means so nice \"here\", however. He did not care to hear of\r\nher difficulties; his head was full of fancies and nothing else. He\r\nlooked upon his illness as something transitory, a trifling ailment, and\r\ndid not think about it at all; he thought of nothing but how they would\r\ngo and sell \"these books.","\" He asked her to read him the gospel.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't read it for a long time... in the original. Some one may ask\r\nme about it and I shall make a mistake; I ought to prepare myself after\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat down beside him and opened the book.\r\n\r\n\"You read beautifully,\" he interrupted her after the first line. \"I see,\r\nI see I was not mistaken,\" he added obscurely but ecstatically. He was,\r\nin fact, in a continual state of enthusiasm.","She read the Sermon on the\r\nMount.\r\n\r\n\"_Assez, assez, mon enfant,_ enough.... Don't you think that that is\r\nenough?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he closed his eyes helplessly. He was very weak, but had not yet\r\nlost consciousness. Sofya Matveyevna was getting up, thinking that he\r\nwanted to sleep. But he stopped her.\r\n\r\n\"My friend, I've been telling lies all my life. Even when I told the\r\ntruth I never spoke for the sake of the truth, but always for my own\r\nsake.","I knew it before, but I only see it now.... Oh, where are those\r\nfriends whom I have insulted with my friendship all my life? And all,\r\nall! _Savez-vous..._ perhaps I am telling lies now; no doubt I am telling\r\nlies now. The worst of it is that I believe myself when I am lying. The\r\nhardest thing in life is to live without telling lies... and without\r\nbelieving in one's lies. Yes, yes, that's just it.","... But wait a bit,\r\nthat can all come afterwards.... We'll be together, together,\" he added\r\nenthusiastically.\r\n\r\n\"Stepan Trofimovitch,\" Sofya Matveyevna asked timidly, \"hadn't I better\r\nsend to the town for the doctor?\"\r\n\r\nHe was tremendously taken aback.\r\n\r\n\"What for? _Est-ce que je suis si malade? Mais rien de s√©rieux._ What need\r\nhave we of outsiders? They may find, besides--and what will happen then?\r\nNo, no, no outsiders and we'll be together.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" he said after a pause, \"read me something more, just the\r\nfirst thing you come across.\"\r\n\r\nSofya Matveyevna opened the Testament and began reading.\r\n\r\n\"Wherever it opens, wherever it happens to open,\" he repeated.\r\n\r\n\"'And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans...'\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that? What is it? Where is that from?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's from the Revelation.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Oh, je m'en souviens, oui, l'Apocalypse.","Lisez, lisez,_ I am trying our\r\nfuture fortunes by the book. I want to know what has turned up. Read on\r\nfrom there....\"\r\n\r\n  \"'And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write: These things\r\n  saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the\r\n  creation of God;\r\n\r\n  \"'I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot;\r\n  I would thou wert cold or hot.\r\n\r\n  \"'So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot,\r\n  I will spue thee out of my mouth.","\"'Because thou sayest, I am rich and increased with goods,\r\n  and have need of nothing: and thou knowest not that thou art wretched,\r\n  and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.'\"\r\n\r\n\"That too... and that's in your book too!\" he exclaimed, with flashing\r\neyes and raising his head from the pillow. \"I never knew that grand\r\npassage! You hear, better be cold, better be cold than lukewarm, than\r\nonly lukewarm.","Oh, I'll prove it! Only don't leave me, don't leave me\r\nalone! We'll prove it, we'll prove it!\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't leave you, Stepan Trofimovitch. I'll never leave you!\" She took\r\nhis hand, pressed it in both of hers, and laid it against her heart,\r\nlooking at him with tears in her eyes. (\"I felt very sorry for him at\r\nthat moment,\" she said, describing it afterwards.)\r\n\r\nHis lips twitched convulsively.\r\n\r\n\"But, Stepan Trofimovitch, what are we to do though? Oughtn't we to let\r\nsome of your friends know, or perhaps your relations?\"\r\n\r\nBut at that he was so dismayed that she was very sorry that she had\r\nspoken of it again.","Trembling and shaking, he besought her to fetch no\r\none, not to do anything. He kept insisting, \"No one, no one! We'll be\r\nalone, by ourselves, alone, _nous partirons ensemble._\"\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty was that the people of the house too began to be\r\nuneasy; they grumbled, and kept pestering Sofya Matveyevna. She paid\r\nthem and managed to let them see her money. This softened them for the\r\ntime, but the man insisted on seeing Stepan Trofimovitch's \"papers.","\"\r\nThe invalid pointed with a supercilious smile to his little bag. Sofya\r\nMatveyevna found in it the certificate of his having resigned his post\r\nat the university, or something of the kind, which had served him as\r\na passport all his life. The man persisted, and said that \"he must be\r\ntaken somewhere, because their house wasn't a hospital, and if he were\r\nto die there might be a bother. We should have no end of trouble.","\" Sofya\r\nMatveyevna tried to speak to him of the doctor, but it appeared that\r\nsending to the town would cost so much that she had to give up all\r\nidea of the doctor. She returned in distress to her invalid. Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch was getting weaker and weaker.\r\n\r\n\"Now read me another passage.... About the pigs,\" he said suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" asked Sofya Matveyevna, very much alarmed.\r\n\r\n\"About the pigs.",".. that's there too... _ces cochons._ I remember the\r\ndevils entered into swine and they all were drowned. You must read me\r\nthat; I'll tell you why afterwards. I want to remember it word for word.\r\nI want it word for word.\"\r\n\r\nSofya Matveyevna knew the gospel well and at once found the passage in\r\nSt. Luke which I have chosen as the motto of my record. I quote it here\r\nagain:\r\n\r\n  \"'And there was there one herd of many swine feeding on the mountain;\r\n  and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them.","And\r\n  he suffered them.\r\n\r\n  \"'Then went the devils out of the man and entered into the swine;\r\n  and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were\r\n  choked.\r\n\r\n  \"'When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and\r\n  told it in the city and in the country.\r\n\r\n  \"'Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus and found\r\n  the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of\r\n  Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind; and they were afraid.","'\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" said Stepan Trofimovitch in great excitement \"_savez-vous,_\r\nthat wonderful and... extraordinary passage has been a stumbling-block\r\nto me all my life... _dans ce livre_.... so much so that I remembered\r\nthose verses from childhood. Now an idea has occurred to me; _une\r\ncomparaison._ A great number of ideas keep coming into my mind now. You\r\nsee, that's exactly like our Russia, those devils that come out of the\r\nsick man and enter into the swine.","They are all the sores, all the foul\r\ncontagions, all the impurities, all the devils great and small that have\r\nmultiplied in that great invalid, our beloved Russia, in the course of\r\nages and ages. _Oui, cette Russie que j'aimais toujours._ But a great\r\nidea and a great Will will encompass it from on high, as with that\r\nlunatic possessed of devils... and all those devils will come forth, all\r\nthe impurity, all the rottenness that was putrefying on the surface .","..\r\nand they will beg of themselves to enter into swine; and indeed maybe\r\nthey have entered into them already! They are we, we and those... and\r\nPetrusha and _les autres avec lui..._ and I perhaps at the head of them,\r\nand we shall cast ourselves down, possessed and raving, from the rocks\r\ninto the sea, and we shall all be drowned--and a good thing too, for\r\nthat is all we are fit for. But the sick man will be healed and\r\n'will sit at the feet of Jesus,' and all will look upon him with\r\nastonishment.","... My dear, _vous comprendrez apr√®s,_ but now it excites me\r\nvery much.... _Vous comprendrez apr√®s. Nous comprendrons ensemble._\"\r\n\r\nHe sank into delirium and at last lost consciousness. So it went on all\r\nthe following day. Sofya Matveyevna sat beside him, crying. She scarcely\r\nslept at all for three nights, and avoided seeing the people of the\r\nhouse, who were, she felt, beginning to take some steps.","Deliverance\r\nonly came on the third day. In the morning Stepan Trofimovitch returned\r\nto consciousness, recognised her, and held out his hand to her. She\r\ncrossed herself hopefully. He wanted to look out of the window. _\"Tiens,\r\nun lac!\"_ he said. \"Good heavens, I had not seen it before!...\" At that\r\nmoment there was the rumble of a carriage at the cottage door and a\r\ngreat hubbub in the house followed.","III\r\n\r\nIt was Varvara Petrovna herself. She had arrived, with Darya Pavlovna,\r\nin a closed carriage drawn by four horses, with two footmen. The marvel\r\nhad happened in the simplest way: Anisim, dying of curiosity, went to\r\nVarvara Petrovna's the day after he reached the town and gossiped to\r\nthe servants, telling them he had met Stepan Trofimovitch alone in a\r\nvillage, that the latter had been seen by peasants walking by himself\r\non the high road, and that he had set off for Spasov by way of Ustyevo\r\naccompanied by Sofya Matveyevna.","As Varvara Petrovna was, for her\r\npart, in terrible anxiety and had done everything she could to find her\r\nfugitive friend, she was at once told about Anisim. When she had heard\r\nhis story, especially the details of the departure for Ustyevo in a cart\r\nin the company of some Sofya Matveyevna, she instantly got ready and set\r\noff post-haste for Ustyevo herself.\r\n\r\nHer stern and peremptory voice resounded through the cottage; even the\r\nlandlord and his wife were intimidated.","She had only stopped to question\r\nthem and make inquiries, being persuaded that Stepan Trofimovitch must\r\nhave reached Spasov long before. Learning that he was still here and\r\nill, she entered the cottage in great agitation.\r\n\r\n\"Well, where is he? Ah, that's you!\" she cried, seeing Sofya Matveyevna,\r\nwho appeared at that very instant in the doorway of the next room. \"I\r\ncan guess from your shameless face that it's you.","Go away, you vile\r\nhussy! Don't let me find a trace of her in the house! Turn her out, or\r\nelse, my girl, I'll get you locked up for good. Keep her safe for a time\r\nin another house. She's been in prison once already in the town; she can\r\ngo back there again. And you, my good man, don't dare to let anyone in\r\nwhile I am here, I beg of you. I am Madame Stavrogin, and I'll take the\r\nwhole house. As for you, my dear, you'll have to give me a full account\r\nof it all.","\"\r\n\r\nThe familiar sounds overwhelmed Stepan Trofimovitch. He began to\r\ntremble. But she had already stepped behind the screen. With flashing\r\neyes she drew up a chair with her foot, and, sinking back in it, she\r\nshouted to Dasha:\r\n\r\n\"Go away for a time! Stay in the other room. Why are you so inquisitive?\r\nAnd shut the door properly after you.\"\r\n\r\nFor some time she gazed in silence with a sort of predatory look into\r\nhis frightened face.","\"Well, how are you getting on, Stepan Trofimovitch? So you've been\r\nenjoying yourself?\" broke from her with ferocious irony.\r\n\r\n_\"Ch√®re,\"_ Stepan Trofimovitch faltered, not knowing what he was saying,\r\n\"I've learnt to know real life in Russia... _et je pr√™cherai l'Evangile._\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, shameless, ungrateful man!\" she wailed suddenly, clasping her\r\nhands. \"As though you had not disgraced me enough, you've taken up\r\nwith.",".. oh, you shameless old reprobate!\"\r\n\r\n_\"Ch√®re...\"_ His voice failed him and he could not articulate a syllable\r\nbut simply gazed with eyes wide with horror.\r\n\r\n\"Who is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"_C'est un ange; c'√©tait plus qu'un ange pour moi._ She's been all\r\nnight... Oh, don't shout, don't frighten her, _ch√®re, ch√®re..._\"\r\n\r\nWith a loud noise, Varvara Petrovna pushed back her chair, uttering a\r\nloud cry of alarm.","\"Water, water!\"\r\n\r\nThough he returned to consciousness, she was still shaking with terror,\r\nand, with pale cheeks, looked at his distorted face. It was only then,\r\nfor the first time, that she guessed the seriousness of his illness.\r\n\r\n\"Darya,\" she whispered suddenly to Darya Pavlovna, \"send at once for the\r\ndoctor, for Salzfish; let Yegorytch go at once. Let him hire horses here\r\nand get another carriage from the town.","He must be here by night.\"\r\n\r\nDasha flew to do her bidding. Stepan Trofimovitch still gazed at her\r\nwith the same wide-open, frightened eyes; his blanched lips quivered.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a bit, Stepan Trofimovitch, wait a bit, my dear!\" she said,\r\ncoaxing him like a child. \"There, there, wait a bit! Darya will come\r\nback and... My goodness, the landlady, the landlady, you come, anyway,\r\nmy good woman!\"\r\n\r\nIn her impatience she ran herself to the landlady.","\"Fetch that woman back at once, this minute. Bring her back, bring her\r\nback!\"\r\n\r\nFortunately Sofya Matveyevna had not yet had time to get away and was\r\nonly just going out of the gate with her pack and her bag. She was\r\nbrought back. She was so panic-stricken that she was trembling in every\r\nlimb. Varvara Petrovna pounced on her like a hawk on a chicken, seized\r\nher by the hand and dragged her impulsively to Stepan Trofimovitch.","\"Here, here she is, then. I've not eaten her. You thought I'd eaten\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch clutched Varvara Petrovna's hand, raised it to his\r\neyes, and burst into tears, sobbing violently and convulsively.\r\n\r\n\"There, calm yourself, there, there, my dear, there, poor dear man!\r\nAch, mercy on us! Calm yourself, will you?\" she shouted frantically.\r\n\"Oh, you bane of my life!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" Stepan Trofimovitch murmured at last, addressing Sofya\r\nMatveyevna, \"stay out there, my dear, I want to say something here.","...\"\r\n\r\nSofya Matveyevna hurried out at once.\r\n\r\n_\"Ch√©rie... ch√©rie...\"_ he gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk for a bit, Stepan Trofimovitch, wait a little till you've\r\nrested. Here's some water. Do wait, will you!\"\r\n\r\nShe sat down on the chair again. Stepan Trofimovitch held her hand\r\ntight. For a long while she would not allow him to speak. He raised her\r\nhand to his lips and fell to kissing it. She set her teeth and looked\r\naway into the corner of the room.","_\"Je vous aimais,\"_ broke from him at last. She had never heard such words\r\nfrom him, uttered in such a voice.\r\n\r\n\"H'm!\" she growled in response.\r\n\r\n_\"Je vous aimais toute ma vie... vingt ans!\"_\r\n\r\nShe remained silent for two or three minutes.\r\n\r\n\"And when you were getting yourself up for Dasha you sprinkled yourself\r\nwith scent,\" she said suddenly, in a terrible whisper.\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch was dumbfounded.","\"You put on a new tie...\"\r\n\r\nAgain silence for two minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember the cigar?\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" he faltered, overcome with horror.\r\n\r\n\"That cigar at the window in the evening... the moon was shining...\r\nafter the arbour... at Skvoreshniki? Do you remember, do you remember?\"\r\nShe jumped up from her place, seized his pillow by the corners and shook\r\nit with his head on it. \"Do you remember, you worthless, worthless,\r\nignoble, cowardly, worthless man, always worthless!\" she hissed in her\r\nfurious whisper, restraining herself from speaking loudly.","At last\r\nshe left him and sank on the chair, covering her face with her hands.\r\n\"Enough!\" she snapped out, drawing herself up. \"Twenty years have\r\npassed, there's no calling them back. I am a fool too.\"\r\n\r\n_\"Je vous aimais.\"_ He clasped his hands again.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you keep on with your _aimais_ and _aimais_? Enough!\" she cried,\r\nleaping up again. \"And if you don't go to sleep at once I'll... You need\r\nrest; go to sleep, go to sleep at once, shut your eyes.","Ach, mercy on\r\nus, perhaps he wants some lunch! What do you eat? What does he eat? Ach,\r\nmercy on us! Where is that woman? Where is she?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a general bustle again. But Stepan Trofimovitch faltered in a\r\nweak voice that he really would like to go to sleep _une heure,_ and then\r\n_un bouillon, un th√©.... enfin il est si heureux._ He lay back and really\r\ndid seem to go to sleep (he probably pretended to).","Varvara Petrovna\r\nwaited a little, and stole out on tiptoe from behind the partition.\r\n\r\nShe settled herself in the landlady's room, turned out the landlady and\r\nher husband, and told Dasha to bring her _that_ woman. There followed an\r\nexamination in earnest.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me all about it, my good girl. Sit down beside me; that's right.\r\nWell?\"\r\n\r\n\"I met Stepan Trofimovitch...\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay, hold your tongue! I warn you that if you tell lies or conceal\r\nanything, I'll ferret it out.","Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stepan Trofimovitch and I... as soon as I came to Hatovo...\" Sofya\r\nMatveyevna began almost breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Stay, hold your tongue, wait a bit! Why do you gabble like that? To\r\nbegin with, what sort of creature are you?\"\r\n\r\nSofya Matveyevna told her after a fashion, giving a very brief account\r\nof herself, however, beginning with Sevastopol. Varvara Petrovna\r\nlistened in silence, sitting up erect in her chair, looking sternly\r\nstraight into the speaker's eyes.","\"Why are you so frightened? Why do you look at the ground? I like people\r\nwho look me straight in the face and hold their own with me. Go on.\"\r\n\r\nShe told of their meeting, of her books, of how Stepan Trofimovitch had\r\nregaled the peasant woman with vodka... \"That's right, that's right,\r\ndon't leave out the slightest detail,\" Varvara Petrovna encouraged her.\r\n\r\nAt last she described how they had set off, and how Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nhad gone on talking, \"really ill by that time,\" and here had given an\r\naccount of his life from the very beginning, talking for some hours.","\"Tell me about his life.\"\r\n\r\nSofya Matveyevna suddenly stopped and was completely nonplussed.\r\n\r\n\"I can't tell you anything about that, madam,\" she brought out, almost\r\ncrying; \"besides, I could hardly understand a word of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! You must have understood something.\"\r\n\r\n\"He told a long time about a distinguished lady with black hair.\" Sofya\r\nMatveyevna flushed terribly though she noticed Varvara Petrovna's fair\r\nhair and her complete dissimilarity with the \"brunette\" of the story.","\"Black-haired? What exactly? Come, speak!\"\r\n\r\n\"How this grand lady was deeply in love with his honour all her life\r\nlong and for twenty years, but never dared to speak, and was shamefaced\r\nbefore him because she was a very stout lady....\"\r\n\r\n\"The fool!\" Varvara Petrovna rapped out thoughtfully but resolutely.\r\n\r\nSofya Matveyevna was in tears by now.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how to tell any of it properly, madam, because I was in a\r\ngreat fright over his honour; and I couldn't understand, as he is such\r\nan intellectual gentleman.","\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not for a goose like you to judge of his intellect. Did he offer\r\nyou his hand?\"\r\n\r\nThe speaker trembled.\r\n\r\n\"Did he fall in love with you? Speak! Did he offer you his hand?\"\r\nVarvara Petrovna shouted peremptorily.\r\n\r\n\"That was pretty much how it was,\" she murmured tearfully. \"But I took\r\nit all to mean nothing, because of his illness,\" she added firmly,\r\nraising her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sofya Matveyevna, madam.","\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, let me tell you, Sofya Matveyevna, that he is a wretched\r\nand worthless little man.... Good Lord! Do you look upon me as a wicked\r\nwoman?\"\r\n\r\nSofya Matveyevna gazed open-eyed.\r\n\r\n\"A wicked woman, a tyrant? Who has ruined his life?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can that be when you are crying yourself, madam?\"\r\n\r\nVarvara Petrovna actually had tears in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sit down, sit down, don't be frightened.","Look me straight in the\r\nface again. Why are you blushing? Dasha, come here. Look at her. What do\r\nyou think of her? Her heart is pure....\"\r\n\r\nAnd to the amazement and perhaps still greater alarm of Sofya\r\nMatveyevna, she suddenly patted her on the cheek.\r\n\r\n\"It's only a pity she is a fool. Too great a fool for her age. That's\r\nall right, my dear, I'll look after you. I see that it's all nonsense.","Stay near here for the time. A room shall be taken for you and you shall\r\nhave food and everything else from me... till I ask for you.\"\r\n\r\nSofya Matveyevna stammered in alarm that she must hurry on.\r\n\r\n\"You've no need to hurry. I'll buy all your books, and meantime you stay\r\nhere. Hold your tongue; don't make excuses. If I hadn't come you would\r\nhave stayed with him all the same, wouldn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't have left him on any account,\" Sofya Matveyevna brought out\r\nsoftly and firmly, wiping her tears.","It was late at night when Doctor Salzfish was brought. He was a very\r\nrespectable old man and a practitioner of fairly wide experience who had\r\nrecently lost his post in the service in consequence of some quarrel\r\non a point of honour with his superiors. Varvara Petrovna instantly\r\nand actively took him under her protection. He examined the patient\r\nattentively, questioned him, and cautiously pronounced to Varvara\r\nPetrovna that \"the sufferer's\" condition was highly dubious in\r\nconsequence of complications, and that they must be prepared \"even for\r\nthe worst.","\" Varvara Petrovna, who had during twenty years got\r\naccustomed to expecting nothing serious or decisive to come from Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch, was deeply moved and even turned pale. \"Is there really no\r\nhope?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can there ever be said to be absolutely no hope? But...\" She did not go\r\nto bed all night, and felt that the morning would never come. As soon\r\nas the patient opened his eyes and returned to consciousness (he was\r\nconscious all the time, however, though he was growing weaker every\r\nhour), she went up to him with a very resolute air.","\"Stepan Trofimovitch, one must be prepared for anything. I've sent for a\r\npriest. You must do what is right....\"\r\n\r\nKnowing his convictions, she was terribly afraid of his refusing. He\r\nlooked at her with surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, nonsense!\" she vociferated, thinking he was already refusing.\r\n\"This is no time for whims. You have played the fool enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"But... am I really so ill, then?\"\r\n\r\nHe agreed thoughtfully.","And indeed I was much surprised to learn from\r\nVarvara Petrovna afterwards that he showed no fear of death at all.\r\nPossibly it was that he simply did not believe it, and still looked upon\r\nhis illness as a trifling one.\r\n\r\nHe confessed and took the sacrament very readily. Every one, Sofya\r\nMatveyevna, and even the servants, came to congratulate him on taking\r\nthe sacrament. They were all moved to tears looking at his sunken and\r\nexhausted face and his blanched and quivering lips.","\"_Oui, mes amis,_ and I only wonder that you... take so much trouble. I\r\nshall most likely get up to-morrow, and we will... set off.... _Toute\r\ncette c√©r√©monie_... for which, of course, I feel every proper respect...\r\nwas...\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg you, father, to remain with the invalid,\" said Varvara Petrovna\r\nhurriedly, stopping the priest, who had already taken off his vestments.\r\n\"As soon as tea has been handed, I beg you to begin to speak of\r\nreligion, to support his faith.","\"\r\n\r\nThe priest spoke; every one was standing or sitting round the sick-bed.\r\n\r\n\"In our sinful days,\" the priest began smoothly, with a cup of tea in\r\nhis hand, \"faith in the Most High is the sole refuge of the race of man\r\nin all the trials and tribulations of life, as well as its hope for that\r\neternal bliss promised to the righteous.\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch seemed to revive, a subtle smile strayed on his\r\nlips.","_\"Mon p√®re, je vous remercie et vous √™tes bien bon, mais...\"_\r\n\r\n\"No _mais_ about it, no _mais_ at all!\" exclaimed Varvara Petrovna,\r\nbounding up from her chair. \"Father,\" she said, addressing the priest,\r\n\"he is a man who... he is a man who... You will have to confess him\r\nagain in another hour! That's the sort of man he is.\"\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch smiled faintly.\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" he said, \"God is necessary to me, if only because He is\r\nthe only being whom one can love eternally.","\"\r\n\r\nWhether he was really converted, or whether the stately ceremony of\r\nthe administration of the sacrament had impressed him and stirred the\r\nartistic responsiveness of his temperament or not, he firmly and, I\r\nam told, with great feeling uttered some words which were in flat\r\ncontradiction with many of his former convictions.\r\n\r\n\"My immortality is necessary if only because God will not be guilty\r\nof injustice and extinguish altogether the flame of love for Him once\r\nkindled in my heart.","And what is more precious than love? Love is higher\r\nthan existence, love is the crown of existence; and how is it possible\r\nthat existence should not be under its dominance? If I have once loved\r\nHim and rejoiced in my love, is it possible that He should extinguish me\r\nand my joy and bring me to nothingness again? If there is a God, then I\r\nam immortal. _Voil√† ma profession de foi._\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a God, Stepan Trofimovitch, I assure you there is,\" Varvara\r\nPetrovna implored him.","\"Give it up, drop all your foolishness for once\r\nin your life!\" (I think she had not quite understood his _profession de\r\nfoi_.)\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" he said, growing more and more animated, though his voice\r\nbroke frequently, \"as soon as I understood... that turning of the cheek,\r\nI... understood something else as well. _J'ai menti toute ma vie,_ all my\r\nlife, all! I should like... but that will do to-morrow.","... To-morrow we\r\nwill all set out.\"\r\n\r\nVarvara Petrovna burst into tears. He was looking about for someone.\r\n\r\n\"Here she is, she is here!\" She seized Sofya Matveyevna by the hand and\r\nled her to him. He smiled tenderly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I should dearly like to live again!\" he exclaimed with an\r\nextraordinary rush of energy. \"Every minute, every instant of life ought\r\nto be a blessing to man... they ought to be, they certainly ought to be!\r\nIt's the duty of man to make it so; that's the law of his nature, which\r\nalways exists even if hidden.","... Oh, I wish I could see Petrusha... and\r\nall of them... Shatov...\"\r\n\r\nI may remark that as yet no one had heard of Shatov's fate--not Varvara\r\nPetrovna nor Darya Pavlovna, nor even Salzfish, who was the last to come\r\nfrom the town.\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch became more and more excited, feverishly so, beyond\r\nhis strength.\r\n\r\n\"The mere fact of the ever present idea that there exists something\r\ninfinitely more just and more happy than I am fills me through and\r\nthrough with tender ecstasy--and glorifies me--oh, whoever I may be,\r\nwhatever I have done! What is far more essential for man than personal\r\nhappiness is to know and to believe at every instant that there is\r\nsomewhere a perfect and serene happiness for all men and for\r\neverything.","... The one essential condition of human existence is that\r\nman should always be able to bow down before something infinitely great.\r\nIf men are deprived of the infinitely great they will not go on living\r\nand will die of despair. The Infinite and the Eternal are as essential\r\nfor man as the little planet on which he dwells. My friends, all, all:\r\nhail to the Great Idea! The Eternal, Infinite Idea! It is essential to\r\nevery man, whoever he may be, to bow down before what is the Great Idea.","Even the stupidest man needs something great. Petrusha... oh, how I want\r\nto see them all again! They don't know, they don't know that that same\r\nEternal, Grand Idea lies in them all!\"\r\n\r\nDoctor Salzfish was not present at the ceremony. Coming in suddenly, he\r\nwas horrified, and cleared the room, insisting that the patient must not\r\nbe excited.\r\n\r\nStepan Trofimovitch died three days later, but by that time he was\r\ncompletely unconscious.","He quietly went out like a candle that is burnt\r\ndown. After having the funeral service performed, Varvara Petrovna\r\ntook the body of her poor friend to Skvoreshniki. His grave is in the\r\nprecincts of the church and is already covered with a marble slab. The\r\ninscription and the railing will be added in the spring.\r\n\r\nVarvara Petrovna's absence from town had lasted eight days. Sofya\r\nMatveyevna arrived in the carriage with her and seems to have settled\r\nwith her for good.","I may mention that as soon as Stepan Trofimovitch\r\nlost consciousness (the morning that he received the sacrament) Varvara\r\nPetrovna promptly asked Sofya Matveyevna to leave the cottage again, and\r\nwaited on the invalid herself unassisted to the end, but she sent for\r\nher at once when he had breathed his last. Sofya Matveyevna was terribly\r\nalarmed by Varvara Petrovna's proposition, or rather command, that she\r\nshould settle for good at Skvoreshniki, but the latter refused to listen\r\nto her protests.","\"That's all nonsense! I will go with you to sell the gospel. I have no\r\none in the world now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a son, however,\" Salzfish observed.\r\n\r\n\"I have no son!\" Varvara Petrovna snapped out--and it was like a\r\nprophecy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nALL THE CRIMES AND VILLAINIES THAT had been perpetrated were discovered\r\nwith extraordinary rapidity, much more quickly than Pyotr Stepanovitch\r\nhad expected.","To begin with, the luckless Marya Ignatyevna waked up\r\nbefore daybreak on the night of her husband's murder, missed him and\r\nflew into indescribable agitation, not seeing him beside her. The woman\r\nwho had been hired by Anna Prohorovna, and was there for the night,\r\ncould not succeed in calming her, and as soon as it was daylight ran\r\nto fetch Arina Prohorovna herself, assuring the invalid that the latter\r\nknew where her husband was, and when he would be back.","Meantime Arina\r\nProhorovna was in some anxiety too; she had already heard from her\r\nhusband of the deed perpetrated that night at Skvoreshniki. He had\r\nreturned home about eleven o'clock in a terrible state of mind and\r\nbody; wringing his hands, he flung himself face downwards on his bed and\r\nshaking with convulsive sobs kept repeating, \"It's not right, it's not\r\nright, it's not right at all!\" He ended, of course, by confessing it all\r\nto Arina Prohorovna--but to no one else in the house.","She left him on\r\nhis bed, sternly impressing upon him that \"if he must blubber he must do\r\nit in his pillow so as not to be overheard, and that he would be a fool\r\nif he showed any traces of it next day.\" She felt somewhat anxious,\r\nhowever, and began at once to clear things up in case of emergency;\r\nshe succeeded in hiding or completely destroying all suspicious papers,\r\nbooks, manifestoes perhaps.","At the same time she reflected that she, her\r\nsister, her aunt, her sister-in-law the student, and perhaps even her\r\nlong-eared brother had really nothing much to be afraid of. When the\r\nnurse ran to her in the morning she went without a second thought to\r\nMarya Ignatyevna's. She was desperately anxious, moreover, to find out\r\nwhether what her husband had told her that night in a terrified and\r\nfrantic whisper, that was almost like delirium, was true--that is,\r\nwhether Pyotr Stepanovitch had been right in his reckoning that Kirillov\r\nwould sacrifice himself for the general benefit.","But she arrived at Marya Ignatyevna's too late: when the latter had sent\r\noff the woman and was left alone, she was unable to bear the suspense;\r\nshe got out of bed, and throwing round her the first garment she could\r\nfind, something very light and unsuitable for the weather, I believe,\r\nshe ran down to Kirillov's lodge herself, thinking that he perhaps would\r\nbe better able than anyone to tell her something about her husband.","The\r\nterrible effect on her of what she saw there may well be imagined. It\r\nis remarkable that she did not read Kirillov's last letter, which lay\r\nconspicuously on the table, overlooking it, of course, in her fright.\r\nShe ran back to her room, snatched up her baby, and went with it out of\r\nthe house into the street. It was a damp morning, there was a fog.\r\nShe met no passers-by in such an out-of-the-way street.","She ran on\r\nbreathless through the wet, cold mud, and at last began knocking at the\r\ndoors of the houses. In the first house no one came to the door, in the\r\nsecond they were so long in coming that she gave it up impatiently and\r\nbegan knocking at a third door. This was the house of a merchant called\r\nTitov. Here she wailed and kept declaring incoherently that her husband\r\nwas murdered, causing a great flutter in the house.","Something was\r\nknown about Shatov and his story in the Titov household; they were\r\nhorror-stricken that she should be running about the streets in such\r\nattire and in such cold with the baby scarcely covered in her arms,\r\nwhen, according to her story, she had only been confined the day before.\r\nThey thought at first that she was delirious, especially as they could\r\nnot make out whether it was Kirillov who was murdered or her husband.","Seeing that they did not believe her she would have run on farther,\r\nbut they kept her by force, and I am told she screamed and struggled\r\nterribly. They went to Filipov's, and within two hours Kirillov's\r\nsuicide and the letter he had left were known to the whole town. The\r\npolice came to question Marya Ignatyevna, who was still conscious, and\r\nit appeared at once that she had not read Kirillov's letter, and they\r\ncould not find out from her what had led her to conclude that her\r\nhusband had been murdered.","She only screamed that if Kirillov was\r\nmurdered, then her husband was murdered, they were together. Towards\r\nmidday she sank into a state of unconsciousness from which she never\r\nrecovered, and she died three days later. The baby had caught cold and\r\ndied before her.\r\n\r\nArina Prohorovna not finding Marya Ignatyevna and the baby, and guessing\r\nsomething was wrong, was about to run home, but she checked herself at\r\nthe gate and sent the nurse to inquire of the gentleman at the lodge\r\nwhether Marya Ignatyevna was not there and whether he knew anything\r\nabout her.","The woman came back screaming frantically. Persuading her not\r\nto scream and not to tell anyone by the time-honoured argument that \"she\r\nwould get into trouble,\" she stole out of the yard.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that she was questioned the same morning as\r\nhaving acted as midwife to Marya Ignatyevna; but they did not get much\r\nout of her. She gave a very cool and sensible account of all she had\r\nherself heard and seen at Shatov's, but as to what had happened she\r\ndeclared that she knew nothing, and could not understand it.","It may well be imagined what an uproar there was in the town. A new\r\n\"sensation,\" another murder! But there was another element in this\r\ncase: it was clear that a secret society of murderers, incendiaries, and\r\nrevolutionists did exist, did actually exist. Liza's terrible death, the\r\nmurder of Stavrogin's wife, Stavrogin himself, the fire, the ball for\r\nthe benefit of the governesses, the laxity of manners and morals in\r\nYulia Mihailovna's circle.","... Even in the disappearance of Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch people insisted on scenting a mystery. All sorts of things\r\nwere whispered about Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch. By the end of the day\r\npeople knew of Pyotr Stepanovitch's absence too, and, strange to say,\r\nless was said of him than of anyone. What was talked of most all that\r\nday was \"the senator.\" There was a crowd almost all day at Filipov's\r\nhouse.","The police certainly were led astray by Kirillov's letter. They\r\nbelieved that Kirillov had murdered Shatov and had himself committed\r\nsuicide. Yet, though the authorities were thrown into perplexity,\r\nthey were not altogether hoodwinked. The word \"park,\" for instance, so\r\nvaguely inserted in Kirillov's letter, did not puzzle anyone as Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch had expected it would. The police at once made a rush\r\nfor Skvoreshniki, not simply because it was the only park in the\r\nneighbourhood but also led thither by a sort of instinct because all the\r\nhorrors of the last few days were connected directly or indirectly with\r\nSkvoreshniki.","That at least is my theory. (I may remark that\r\nVarvara Petrovna had driven off early that morning in chase of Stepan\r\nTrofimovitch, and knew nothing of what had happened in the town.)\r\n\r\nThe body was found in the pond that evening. What led to the discovery\r\nof it was the finding of Shatov's cap at the scene of the murder, where\r\nit had been with extraordinary carelessness overlooked by the murderers.","The appearance of the body, the medical examination and certain\r\ndeductions from it roused immediate suspicions that Kirillov must have\r\nhad accomplices. It became evident that a secret society really did\r\nexist of which Shatov and Kirillov were members and which was connected\r\nwith the manifestoes. Who were these accomplices? No one even thought of\r\nany member of the quintet that day. It was ascertained that Kirillov\r\nhad lived like a hermit, and in so complete a seclusion that it had been\r\npossible, as stated in the letter, for Fedka to lodge with him for so\r\nmany days, even while an active search was being made for him.","The chief\r\nthing that worried every one was the impossibility of discovering a\r\nconnecting-link in this chaos.\r\n\r\nThere is no saying what conclusions and what disconnected theories our\r\npanic-stricken townspeople would have reached, if the whole mystery had\r\nnot been suddenly solved next day, thanks to Lyamshin.\r\n\r\nHe broke down. He behaved as even Pyotr Stepanovitch had towards the end\r\nbegun to fear he would.","Left in charge of Tolkatchenko, and afterwards\r\nof Erkel, he spent all the following day lying in his bed with his face\r\nturned to the wall, apparently calm, not uttering a word, and scarcely\r\nanswering when he was spoken to. This is how it was that he heard\r\nnothing all day of what was happening in the town. But Tolkatchenko,\r\nwho was very well informed about everything, took into his head by\r\nthe evening to throw up the task of watching Lyamshin which Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch had laid upon him, and left the town, that is, to put it\r\nplainly, made his escape; the fact is, they lost their heads as Erkel\r\nhad predicted they would.","I may mention, by the way, that Liputin had\r\ndisappeared the same day before twelve o'clock. But things fell out so\r\nthat his disappearance did not become known to the authorities till\r\nthe evening of the following day, when, the police went to question his\r\nfamily, who were panic-stricken at his absence but kept quiet from fear\r\nof consequences. But to return to Lyamshin: as soon as he was left alone\r\n(Erkel had gone home earlier, relying on Tolkatchenko) he ran out of\r\nhis house, and, of course, very soon learned the position of affairs.","Without even returning home he too tried to run away without knowing\r\nwhere he was going. But the night was so dark and to escape was so\r\nterrible and difficult, that after going through two or three streets,\r\nhe returned home and locked himself up for the whole night. I believe\r\nthat towards morning he attempted to commit suicide but did not succeed.\r\nHe remained locked up till midday--and then suddenly he ran to the\r\nauthorities.","He is said to have crawled on his knees, to have sobbed and\r\nshrieked, to have kissed the floor crying out that he was not worthy to\r\nkiss the boots of the officials standing before him. They soothed him,\r\nwere positively affable to him. His examination lasted, I am told, for\r\nthree hours. He confessed everything, everything, told every detail,\r\neverything he knew, every point, anticipating their questions, hurried\r\nto make a clean breast of it all, volunteering unnecessary information\r\nwithout being asked.","It turned out that he knew enough, and presented\r\nthings in a fairly true light: the tragedy of Shatov and Kirillov, the\r\nfire, the death of the Lebyadkins, and the rest of it were relegated\r\nto the background. Pyotr Stepanovitch, the secret society, the\r\norganisation, and the network were put in the first place. When asked\r\nwhat was the object of so many murders and scandals and dastardly\r\noutrages, he answered with feverish haste that \"it was with the idea of\r\nsystematically undermining the foundations, systematically destroying\r\nsociety and all principles; with the idea of nonplussing every one and\r\nmaking hay of everything, and then, when society was tottering, sick\r\nand out of joint, cynical and sceptical though filled with an intense\r\neagerness for self-preservation and for some guiding idea, suddenly to\r\nseize it in their hands, raising the standard of revolt and relying on a\r\ncomplete network of quintets, which were actively, meanwhile, gathering\r\nrecruits and seeking out the weak spots which could be attacked.","\"\r\nIn conclusion, he said that here in our town Pyotr Stepanovitch had\r\norganised only the first experiment in such systematic disorder, so to\r\nspeak, as a programme for further activity, and for all the quintets--and\r\nthat this was his own (Lyamshin's) idea, his own theory, \"and that he\r\nhoped they would remember it and bear in mind how openly and properly\r\nhe had given his information, and therefore might be of use hereafter.","\"\r\nBeing asked definitely how many quintets there were, he answered that\r\nthere were immense numbers of them, that all Russia was overspread with\r\na network, and although he brought forward no proofs, I believe his\r\nanswer was perfectly sincere. He produced only the programme of the\r\nsociety, printed abroad, and the plan for developing a system of future\r\nactivity roughly sketched in Pyotr Stepanovitch's own handwriting.","It\r\nappeared that Lyamshin had quoted the phrase about \"undermining the\r\nfoundation,\" word for word from this document, not omitting a single\r\nstop or comma, though he had declared that it was all his own theory.\r\nOf Yulia Mihailovna he very funnily and quite without provocation\r\nvolunteered the remark, that \"she was innocent and had been made a\r\nfool of.\" But, strange to say, he exonerated Nikolay Stavrogin from\r\nall share in the secret society, from any collaboration with Pyotr\r\nStepanovitch.","(Lyamshin had no conception of the secret and very absurd\r\nhopes that Pyotr Stepanovitch was resting on Stavrogin.) According to\r\nhis story Nikolay Stavrogin had nothing whatever to do with the death of\r\nthe Lebyadkins, which had been planned by Pyotr Stepanovitch alone\r\nand with the subtle aim of implicating the former in the crime, and\r\ntherefore making him dependent on Pyotr Stepanovitch; but instead of\r\nthe gratitude on which Pyotr Stepanovitch had reckoned with shallow\r\nconfidence, he had roused nothing but indignation and even despair in\r\n\"the generous heart of Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch.","\" He wound up, by a hint,\r\nevidently intentional, volunteered hastily, that Stavrogin was perhaps\r\na very important personage, but that there was some secret about that,\r\nthat he had been living among us, so to say, incognito, that he had some\r\ncommission, and that very possibly he would come back to us again\r\nfrom Petersburg. (Lyamshin was convinced that Stavrogin had gone\r\nto Petersburg), but in quite a different capacity and in different\r\nsurroundings, in the suite of persons of whom perhaps we should soon\r\nhear, and that all this he had heard from Pyotr Stepanovitch, \"Nikolay\r\nVsyevolodovitch's secret enemy.","\"\r\n\r\nHere I will note that two months later, Lyamshin admitted that he had\r\nexonerated Stavrogin on purpose, hoping that he would protect him and\r\nwould obtain for him a mitigation in the second degree of his sentence,\r\nand that he would provide him with money and letters of introduction\r\nin Siberia. From this confession it is evident that he had an\r\nextraordinarily exaggerated conception of Stavrogin's powers.","On the same day, of course, the police arrested Virginsky and in their\r\nzeal took his whole family too. (Arina Prohorovna, her sister, aunt, and\r\neven the girl student were released long ago; they say that Shigalov too\r\nwill be set free very shortly because he cannot be classed with any of\r\nthe other prisoners. But all that is so far only gossip.) Virginsky at\r\nonce pleaded guilty. He was lying ill with fever when he was arrested.","I am told that he seemed almost relieved; \"it was a load off his heart,\"\r\nhe is reported to have said. It is rumoured that he is giving his\r\nevidence without reservation, but with a certain dignity, and has not\r\ngiven up any of his \"bright hopes,\" though at the same time he curses\r\nthe political method (as opposed to the Socialist one), in which he\r\nhad been unwittingly and heedlessly carried \"by the vortex of combined\r\ncircumstances.","\" His conduct at the time of the murder has been put in\r\na favourable light, and I imagine that he too may reckon on some\r\nmitigation of his sentence. That at least is what is asserted in the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nBut I doubt whether there is any hope for mercy in Erkel's case. Ever\r\nsince his arrest he has been obstinately silent, or has misrepresented\r\nthe facts as far as he could. Not one word of regret has been wrung\r\nfrom him so far.","Yet even the sternest of the judges trying him has\r\nbeen moved to some compassion by his youth, by his helplessness, by the\r\nunmistakable evidence that he is nothing but a fanatical victim of a\r\npolitical impostor, and, most of all, by his conduct to his mother,\r\nto whom, as it appears, he used to send almost the half of his small\r\nsalary. His mother is now in the town; she is a delicate and ailing\r\nwoman, aged beyond her years; she weeps and positively grovels on the\r\nground imploring mercy for her son.","Whatever may happen, many among us\r\nfeel sorry for Erkel.\r\n\r\nLiputin was arrested in Petersburg, where he had been living for a\r\nfortnight. His conduct there sounds almost incredible and is difficult\r\nto explain. He is said to have had a passport in a forged name and quite\r\na large sum of money upon him, and had every possibility of escaping\r\nabroad, yet instead of going he remained in Petersburg.","He spent some\r\ntime hunting for Stavrogin and Pyotr Stepanovitch. Suddenly he took to\r\ndrinking and gave himself up to a debauchery that exceeded all bounds,\r\nlike a man who had lost all reason and understanding of his position. He\r\nwas arrested in Petersburg drunk in a brothel. There is a rumour that he\r\nhas not by any means lost heart, that he tells lies in his evidence and\r\nis preparing for the approaching trial hopefully (?) and, as it\r\nwere, triumphantly.","He even intends to make a speech at the trial.\r\nTolkatchenko, who was arrested in the neighbourhood ten days after his\r\nflight, behaves with incomparably more decorum; he does not shuffle\r\nor tell lies, he tells all he knows, does not justify himself, blames\r\nhimself with all modesty, though he, too, has a weakness for rhetoric;\r\nhe tells readily what he knows, and when knowledge of the peasantry and\r\nthe revolutionary elements among them is touched upon, he positively\r\nattitudinises and is eager to produce an effect.","He, too, is meaning, I\r\nam told, to make a speech at the trial. Neither he nor Liputin seem very\r\nmuch afraid, curious as it seems.\r\n\r\nI repeat that the case is not yet over. Now, three months afterwards,\r\nlocal society has had time to rest, has recovered, has got over it, has\r\nan opinion of its own, so much so that some people positively look\r\nupon Pyotr Stepanovitch as a genius or at least as possessed of \"some\r\ncharacteristics of a genius.","\" \"Organisation!\" they say at the club,\r\nholding up a finger. But all this is very innocent and there are not\r\nmany people who talk like that. Others, on the other hand, do not deny\r\nhis acuteness, but point out that he was utterly ignorant of real life,\r\nthat he was terribly theoretical, grotesquely and stupidly one-sided,\r\nand consequently shallow in the extreme. As for his moral qualities all\r\nare agreed; about that there are no two opinions.","I do not know whom to mention next so as not to forget anyone. Mavriky\r\nNikolaevitch has gone away for good, I don't know where. Old Madame\r\nDrozdov has sunk into dotage.... I have still one very gloomy story to\r\ntell, however. I will confine myself to the bare facts.\r\n\r\nOn her return from Ustyevo, Varvara Petrovna stayed at her town house.\r\nAll the accumulated news broke upon her at once and gave her a terrible\r\nshock.","She shut herself up alone. It was evening; every one was tired\r\nand went to bed early.\r\n\r\nIn the morning a maid with a mysterious air handed a note to Darya\r\nPavlovna. The note had, so she said, arrived the evening before, but\r\nlate, when all had gone to bed, so that she had not ventured to wake\r\nher. It had not come by post, but had been put in Alexey Yegorytch's\r\nhand in Skvoreshniki by some unknown person.","And Alexey Yegorytch had\r\nimmediately set off and put it into her hands himself and had then\r\nreturned to Skvoreshniki.\r\n\r\nFor a long while Darya Pavlovna gazed at the letter with a beating\r\nheart, and dared not open it. She knew from whom it came: the writer was\r\nNikolay Stavrogin. She read what was written on the envelope: \"To Alexey\r\nYegorytch, to be given secretly to Darya Pavlovna.\"\r\n\r\nHere is the letter word for word, without the slightest correction of\r\nthe defects in style of a Russian aristocrat who had never mastered the\r\nRussian grammar in spite of his European education.","\"Dear Darya Pavlovna,--At one time you expressed a wish to be my nurse\r\nand made me promise to send for you when I wanted you. I am going away\r\nin two days and shall not come back. Will you go with me?\r\n\r\n\"Last year, like Herzen, I was naturalised as a citizen of the canton\r\nof Uri, and that nobody knows. There I've already bought a little house.\r\nI've still twelve thousand roubles left; we'll go and live there for\r\never.","I don't want to go anywhere else ever.\r\n\r\n\"It's a very dull place, a narrow valley, the mountains restrict both\r\nvision and thought. It's very gloomy. I chose the place because there\r\nwas a little house to be sold. If you don't like it I'll sell it and buy\r\nanother in some other place.\r\n\r\n\"I am not well, but I hope to get rid of hallucinations in that air.\r\nIt's physical, and as for the moral you know everything; but do you know\r\nall?\r\n\r\n\"I've told you a great deal of my life, but not all.","Even to you!\r\nNot all. By the way, I repeat that in my conscience I feel myself\r\nresponsible for my wife's death. I haven't seen you since then, that's\r\nwhy I repeat it. I feel guilty about Lizaveta Nikolaevna too; but you\r\nknow about that; you foretold almost all that.\r\n\r\n\"Better not come to me. My asking you to is a horrible meanness. And why\r\nshould you bury your life with me? You are dear to me, and when I was\r\nmiserable it was good to be beside you; only with you I could speak\r\nof myself aloud.","But that proves nothing. You defined it yourself, 'a\r\nnurse'--it's your own expression; why sacrifice so much? Grasp this,\r\ntoo, that I have no pity for you since I ask you, and no respect for\r\nyou since I reckon on you. And yet I ask you and I reckon on you. In\r\nany case I need your answer for I must set off very soon. In that case I\r\nshall go alone.\r\n\r\n\"I expect nothing of Uri; I am simply going.","I have not chosen a gloomy\r\nplace on purpose. I have no ties in Russia--everything is as alien to\r\nme there as everywhere. It's true that I dislike living there more than\r\nanywhere; but I can't hate anything even there!\r\n\r\n\"I've tried my strength everywhere. You advised me to do this 'that I\r\nmight learn to know myself.' As long as I was experimenting for myself\r\nand for others it seemed infinite, as it has all my life.","Before your\r\neyes I endured a blow from your brother; I acknowledged my marriage in\r\npublic. But to what to apply my strength, that is what I've never seen,\r\nand do not see now in spite of all your praises in Switzerland, which\r\nI believed in. I am still capable, as I always was, of desiring to do\r\nsomething good, and of feeling pleasure from it; at the same time I\r\ndesire evil and feel pleasure from that too.","But both feelings are\r\nalways too petty, and are never very strong. My desires are too weak;\r\nthey are not enough to guide me. On a log one may cross a river but not\r\non a chip. I say this that you may not believe that I am going to Uri\r\nwith hopes of any sort.\r\n\r\n\"As always I blame no one. I've tried the depths of debauchery and\r\nwasted my strength over it. But I don't like vice and I didn't want it.","You have been watching me of late. Do you know that I looked upon our\r\niconoclasts with spite, from envy of their hopes? But you had no need to\r\nbe afraid. I could not have been one of them for I never shared anything\r\nwith them. And to do it for fun, from spite I could not either, not\r\nbecause I am afraid of the ridiculous--I cannot be afraid of the\r\nridiculous--but because I have, after all, the habits of a gentleman and\r\nit disgusted me.","But if I had felt more spite and envy of them I might\r\nperhaps have joined them. You can judge how hard it has been for me, and\r\nhow I've struggled from one thing to another.\r\n\r\n\"Dear friend! Great and tender heart which I divined! Perhaps you dream\r\nof giving me so much love and lavishing on me so much that is beautiful\r\nfrom your beautiful soul, that you hope to set up some aim for me at\r\nlast by it? No, it's better for you to be more cautious, my love will\r\nbe as petty as I am myself and you will be unhappy.","Your brother told me\r\nthat the man who loses connection with his country loses his gods, that\r\nis, all his aims. One may argue about everything endlessly, but from me\r\nnothing has come but negation, with no greatness of soul, no force.\r\nEven negation has not come from me. Everything has always been petty and\r\nspiritless. Kirillov, in the greatness of his soul, could not compromise\r\nwith an idea, and shot himself; but I see, of course, that he was\r\ngreat-souled because he had lost his reason.","I can never lose my reason,\r\nand I can never believe in an idea to such a degree as he did. I cannot\r\neven be interested in an idea to such a degree. I can never, never shoot\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n\"I know I ought to kill myself, to brush myself off the earth like a\r\nnasty insect; but I am afraid of suicide, for I am afraid of showing\r\ngreatness of soul. I know that it will be another sham again--the last\r\ndeception in an endless series of deceptions.","What good is there in\r\ndeceiving oneself? Simply to play at greatness of soul? Indignation and\r\nshame I can never feel, therefore not despair.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me for writing so much. I wrote without noticing. A hundred\r\npages would be too little and ten lines would be enough. Ten lines would\r\nbe enough to ask you to be a nurse. Since I left Skvoreshniki I've been\r\nliving at the sixth station on the line, at the stationmaster's.","I got\r\nto know him in the time of debauchery five years ago in Petersburg. No\r\none knows I am living there. Write to him. I enclose the address.\r\n\r\n\"Nikolay Stavrogin.\"\r\n\r\nDarya Pavlovna went at once and showed the letter to Varvara Petrovna.\r\nShe read it and asked Dasha to go out of the room so that she might read\r\nit again alone; but she called her back very quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going?\" she asked almost timidly.","\"I am going,\" answered Dasha.\r\n\r\n\"Get ready! We'll go together.\"\r\n\r\nDasha looked at her inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"What is there left for me to do here? What difficulty will it make?\r\nI'll be naturalised in Uri, too, and live in the valley.... Don't be\r\nuneasy, I won't be in the way.\"\r\n\r\nThey began packing quickly to be in time to catch the midday train.\r\nBut in less than half an hour's time Alexey Yegorytch arrived from\r\nSkvoreshniki.","He announced that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had suddenly\r\narrived that morning by the early train, and was now at Skvoreshniki but\r\n\"in such a state that his honour did not answer any questions, walked\r\nthrough all the rooms and shut himself up in his own wing....\"\r\n\r\n\"Though I received no orders I thought it best to come and inform you,\"\r\nAlexey Yegorytch concluded with a very significant expression.","Varvara Petrovna looked at him searchingly and did not question him. The\r\ncarriage was got ready instantly. Varvara Petrovna set off with Dasha.\r\nThey say that she kept crossing herself on the journey.\r\n\r\nIn Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch's wing of the house all the doors were open\r\nand he was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't he be upstairs?\" Fomushka ventured.\r\n\r\nIt was remarkable that several servants followed Varvara Petrovna while\r\nthe others all stood waiting in the drawing-room.","They would never have\r\ndared to commit such a breach of etiquette before. Varvara Petrovna saw\r\nit and said nothing.\r\n\r\nThey went upstairs. There there were three rooms; but they found no one\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't his honour have gone up there?\" someone suggested, pointing\r\nto the door of the loft. And in fact, the door of the loft which was\r\nalways closed had been opened and was standing ajar. The loft was right\r\nunder the roof and was reached by a long, very steep and narrow wooden\r\nladder.","There was a sort of little room up there too.\r\n\r\n\"I am not going up there. Why should he go up there?\" said Varvara\r\nPetrovna, turning terribly pale as she looked at the servants. They\r\ngazed back at her and said nothing. Dasha was trembling.\r\n\r\nVarvara Petrovna rushed up the ladder; Dasha followed, but she had\r\nhardly entered the loft when she uttered a scream and fell senseless.\r\n\r\nThe citizen of the canton of Uri was hanging there behind the door.","On\r\nthe table lay a piece of paper with the words in pencil: \"No one is to\r\nblame, I did it myself.\" Beside it on the table lay a hammer, a piece\r\nof soap, and a large nail--obviously an extra one in case of need. The\r\nstrong silk cord upon which Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch had hanged himself\r\nhad evidently been chosen and prepared beforehand and was thickly\r\nsmeared with soap. Everything proved that there had been premeditation\r\nand consciousness up to the last moment.","At the inquest our doctors absolutely and emphatically rejected all idea\r\nof insanity.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Possessed, by Fyodor Dostoevsky\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE POSSESSED ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 8117-8.txt or 8117-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.","gutenberg.org/8/1/1/8117/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Moynihan, David Widger and Michelle Knight\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.","Special rules,\r\nset forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to\r\ncopying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to\r\nprotect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.

Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.","We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.","International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.","To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.","Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."]}
